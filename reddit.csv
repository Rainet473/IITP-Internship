Advil problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/nnulwt/accutane_results_what_worked_for_me/,b'Accutane results + what worked for me!',"Image570.jpg, Image571.jpg, Image572.jpg","b""Hello!\n\nI've read this subreddit for my entire accutane journey so now that it's two weeks from coming to a close, I thought i'd do a post in hopes of helping others with all my side effects and what worked for me!\n\nI (26F, 155lbs) started a five month course of Accutane in January (40-80-80-80-80). Before I started, I made a point to try to repair the moisture barrier of my *entire body*. I bought Aveeno moisturizing shower wash with a loofah on a stick (to reach my back) and put the cerave in a tub on my whole body after every shower for about two weeks prior. I really think this helped, because my body was not dry for almost my entire treatment! I kept this habit up the entire five months.\n\nWhen I started, my first side effect was dry scalp. It was SO itchy and flakey! My local pharmacist recommended that for the duration of my treatment, I should use a baby shampoo (he recommended Cerave) and a paraben-free conditioner. The baby shampoo was a godsend! Like all Cerave products, it has ceramides to help with hydration. Your scalp is skin just like the rest of your body, so it needs hydration too!\n\nThis took care of the scalp problem 100%. I was concerned about hair loss prior to accutane since I was ALREADY losing hair before starting, but I actually saw hair growth during my treatment! This is because the extreme oil that was always in my hair weighed it down and made it fall. Take that away, hydrate the skin properly, and my mini bald spots filled in!\n\nTiredness also hit me hard in the beginning and the only thing that really helped was drinking my bodyweight in water. But even with that, the exhaustion was hard to beat. I would say this was my second to most severe side effect.\n\nDry lips were not a huge side effect for me, surprisingly enough! Towards my final two months I looked a bit like the Joker with tears on both sides of my lips, but the lips themselves didn't really crack during the treatment. I put hyaluronic acid on my slightly damp lips, waited 2 minutes, then put LRP Cicaplast, topped by aquaphor to lock it all in.\n\nMy skin would only get dry and flake if I failed to do my skincare routine (which did occasionally happen out of the exhaustion mentioned above). But, if I did do it, my skin was smooth!\n\nRoutine:\n\nAM:- Wash face with water- Cerave hyaluronic acid serum- The Ordinary moisturizer- LRP Anthelios sunscreen SPF 60\n\nAfternoon:- Wash face with Cerave hydrating facial cleanser- The Ordinary hyaluronic acid- The Ordinary Niacimide (A note on this--my skin has always been the type to survive anything. I told myself I'd keep this in my routine to help with scarring but if ever it burned, I'd stop. It never did, so I used it the whole treatment!)- LRP Lipikar Balm AP\n\nEvening:- Wipe face with Avene extremely gentle cleanser lotion on cotton pad- Cerave PM skin renewing night cream\n\nI never suffered a nosebleed but I did suffer from leaky nostrils and a sweaty upper lip. To deal with the leaky nostrils, in the morning and at night I did a saline spray, followed by Nozoil (hydrating sesame oil spray) and then a product called Secaris applied with a q-tip.\n\nThe major side effect I had that was a literal pain was lower back pain. I have always had a terrible posture and knew I would hit this problem eventually, but Accutane really sped that process up. I would wake up EVERY morning with a lower back so sore that I couldn't stay in one position for more than 5 minutes. On bad nights, the back pain would wake me up and I would have to get out of bed to walk around and stretch.\n\nThis went away during the day unless I sat in a stupid position for a long time.\n\nWhat helped a lot was getting a side sleeper knee pillow on Amazon. It helps with the alignment of your spine as you sleep, so it took a lot of pressure off my back. It didn't cure the problem, but it helped. I also got a back belt that I wore during the day to help keep my core muscles engaged. On days where I worked my core either through exercise or with the belt, the overnight pain was drastically reduced.\n\nThere was awhile where I would put Voltaren Emulgel on my lower back before going to bed every night to prevent the pain, but I tried to stop doing that. Instead I keep advil on my nighstand and if I wake up with pain, I take 3.\n\nRegarding the purge: I thought I would escape it, silly me. It started about 2 months in for me and lasted until about the start of month 4, but I still got new pimples at the end of month 4. I talked to my derm about prolonging my treatment since I wasn't 100% clear, but I will have hit my cumulative dose and he's not comfortable continuing. Instead he made an appointment for me one month after I stop, to see what happens and to determine further treatment going forward. In the end, I would say I have been completely clear since week 1 of month 5 (and I am currently on week 2.5).\n\nI saw the viral TikTok about noses shrinking on Accutane and naturally compared my nose before and after. It shrunk a little. Out of curiosity, I asked my derm about it! He said that noses don't actually shrink, but that people who take Accutane tend to suffer from chronic inflammation of the face. Take away that inflammation and your features will look smaller! So if this has happened to you, welcome to your regular-sized nose. :)\n\nThat's about all that I can think of off the top of my head! I'd be glad to answer any questions if anyone has.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kojzlqtyw3271.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=948d8030f5a20c9645bd50396dec4c95fc282646\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/syipmztyw3271.jpg?width=2320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3aa277d264b964cb58b9dbfd5d29bc08da6b5361\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8xoroztyw3271.jpg?width=2320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5e5c7c0830db1a1c1b0f555c08ed878c98bbe507"""
NSAID eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/c0l4gq/microdiscectomy_3_day_postop_check_in/,b'Microdiscectomy 3 day post-op check in',,"b""Hey everyone! I hope you are all having a relatively pain free day. I had a laminectomy and microdiscectomy 3 days ago on my L5-S1 herniated disc. I had my sciatic pain for 4 months prior and nothing seemed to make it better so I decided surgery was the only option I had left. Here's my story.\n\nThe week leading up to the surgery they said no NSAIDS, and I found that some mix between narcos and gabapentin seemed to help but only for a couple hours, and I limited myself to 3 a day, so the rest of the day was pretty painful. And without any anti-inflammatory aids it was a pretty rough week. Other pre-op things I had to do were get some labs, take some antibiotics, and shower with hibiclens a few times.\n\nThe morning of the surgery I was excited and terrified at the same time. But even just laying on the hospital bed waiting to get taken in, my sciatica was still bugging me so I wasn't having second thoughts at all. They put in an IV and started wheeling me to the OR and that's all I remember.\n\nI awoke with a bit of nausea and for some reason I could not stop shaking. It freaked me out a little bit but went away after a few minutes. The next thing I noticed was my sciatica was completely gone. My surgeon said my herniation was even worse than it was on my MRI and it was a good thing I got the surgery as he didn't think it would have healed by itself.\n\nI ended up staying one night in the hospital, they said some people go home almost right away, but I was comfortable there and didn't see the need to rush out. They basically just kept an eye on my vitals and gave me meds. They told me I could get up and use the bathroom or they would give me a catheter, that got me up quickly.  I had a couple visits from a PT and OT and they basically taught me how to roll out of bed, dress myself, shower, etc. They went over the rules, mainly no bending, lifting, or twisting for weeks. I bought some tools from the hospital like a grabber and sock aid and then went home. \n\nIt is now day 3 post-op and recovery is pretty slow. One big question and fear I had before surgery was what the pain was like. Basically the pain is less than my bad sciatica flare UPS and it only hurts when I move. Still no sciatic pain except for an occasional dull pain in my hip which I'm not that worried about. I can usually lay in bed in comfort as opposed to it hurting pretty much non stop before. \n\nThe hardest part is doing simple tasks without bending or twisting. I can do most things on my own, like I don't need help going to the bathroom or anything like that. Mainly just with reaching for things or lifting things. I can do stairs a couple times a day, and I can sit at the dinner table to eat, although not for very long.\n\n Pain wise, today doesn't feel much better than a couple days ago, and I was hoping for a little progress by now, so it's definitely going to be a slow recovery. They gave me pain pills for 7 days so hopefully it will be mostly gone by then.\n\nI'm very glad I did it, I can at least now see the light at the end of the tunnel. I just hope for a slight improvement in pain each day and increase my activity level a little each day. I hope to be back to living a somewhat normal life some time in the near future. I at least have hope again.\n\nIf you have any questions about the surgery please don't hesitate to ask.\n\nEdit: 5 days after surgery now. Sciatica still gone and the incision site is getting better. Starting to ween myself off my meds and try to get back to feeling somewhat normal again. I can go for short walks but still can't sit for very long. I've had a little nausea but mostly I'm just so tired. And I want to try to be more active but I'm not sure what to do with myself.\n\nEdit 2: 1 week since surgery and just realized how bad the constipation had gotten. Guess I wasn't taking my colace enough or eating enough fiber. I spent most of the day yesterday sitting on the toilet and feeling like hell, today I feel a little bit better. Stopped taking pain pills and for the next couple days will focus on digestion. Now I just have to figure out what is causing my insomnia, only sleeping a couple hours at a time is getting old. For the most part my incision feels good and try to walk a little more each day.\n\nEdit 3: 10 days since surgery and still have lingering hip pain when standing or walking. Doctor said it was normal for the nerve to wake up and could take some time to heal. Back pain from surgery is almost completely gone with some occasional pain when I sit for too long or move the wrong way.  Stopped taking all of my meds and hip pain is manageable without it.  My energy level and appetite is mostly back to normal. I can walk a mile+ without any issues other than the hip discomfort.  Yesterday my wife took me to run some errands and it felt good to leave the house, I was able to sit in a car with minimal discomfort.  I will still take things slowly and cautiously and continue no BLT. I will try to go back to work Monday since I am out of leave time but I am nervous about driving and sitting/standing all day.\n\nEdit 4: 2 weeks after surgery now and I'm back at work.  Driving isn't too bad if I can find a good position, but twisting still hurts a little and seems to aggravate my nerve so I still try to limit driving as much as I can.  At my desk I try to switch between sitting and standing every half hour or so but I still get a little tired.  I may work partial days this week and build up to working full days next week.\n\nEdit 5: 3 week update!  Still have a bit of a nagging pain in my hip, but it comes and goes and is pretty mild.  I can live with it for a while, and it's a good reminder not to bend over or twist.  My incision is mostly healed now, almost all of the scab came off yesterday.  I can now sit for an hour+ although I try not to.  But if feels good to be able to do little things like go out to eat."""

NSAID rash,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/n3z8qo/looking_for_ideasguidance_for_right_side/,b'Looking for Ideas/Guidance for Right Side Condition - No Diagnosis After 9 Medical Professionals',,"b'I understand that rule 1 of r/Sciatica is ""Pursue pro medical care"", which I\'ve done, many times, to no avail. With that being said, I\'m hoping that I can hear if any of you have had experiences similar to mine and what you did/are doing to cope/treat it. Quite frankly, with this condition that I\'m about to describe, I\'m getting desperate because nobody knows what\'s wrong with me and it seems to be getting worse as time goes on. I\'ve read and tried the things in *Back Mechanic* to no avail. \n\n\nEssentially, I have very few ideas of other avenues to explore so I\'m hoping you will have some.\n\n\n# Personal details:\n* **Stats:** 21M, 6\'5"", 147 lbs/66.7 kg, 17.4 BMI, white \n* **Primary Complaint:** Pain on my *entire* right side starting in November 2019 and increasing gradually in intensity since then. Since the beginning, the pain wasn\'t concentrated on my right side but for the past 4-5 months, it mostly has been. It seems like the pain originates in my right lower back/right hip. I will go into more depth in the ""Symptoms"" section.\n* **Preexisting Medical Conditions:** I was diagnosed with minor scoliosis in 2016. I forget the degrees of the curve but it wasn\'t (and isn\'t) major. I\'ve also always had some eczema-like situation going on on the back of my arms but have no idea what it is and it\'s never been uncomfortable. Other than that, on paper, I\'m a healthy kid.\n* **Substances:** No medications currently (I have tried various supplements, a steroid, and NSAIDS, however), and no alcohol.\n\n\n# Symptoms:\n* **Pain Description:** I would describe it as muscle pain. It\'s not a sharp sort of pain but more of an intense muscle ache wherever it occurs.\n * **Locations:** The pain started out being all over my back but in the past 4-5 months, it has moved into nearly all of my right side. It seems to originate in my back (~L2) and is felt distally nearly everywhere on my right side (right side headaches for the past few weeks, neck, jaw, cheek, upper back, lower back, shoulder, arm, hand, fingers, buttock, quad, hamstring, calf, achilles, toes, and foot). I don\'t feel the pain in all of these places at once but during any given day, I can be pretty sure that I will feel it in all right-side places at some point during that day. Essentially, I\'m not in full right side pain at any given moment.\n * **Joints:** I can ""click"" some of my right joints on command (wrist, hip, ankle, and I used to be able to do the right side of my jaw but not anymore). Very rarely do these joints hurt or feel inflamed.\n * **Triggers:** \n     * Sitting in a chair/car seat without ice/heat causes my right hip and the right side of my back (~L2) to hurt more than normally. Sometimes, seemingly randomly, sitting will also hurt my right foot, right calf, or even right arm/shoulder. \n     * Standing for a while generally causes the area ~L2, my buttock, and sometimes right foot to start. \n     * Laying on my right side hurts my right hip. Laying on my back isn\'t too bad though.\n     * Laying flat on my back, knees to chest hurts my right hip but not left. I think it\'s the hip flexor but am not sure.\n * **Most Intense Places:** Quite consistently, regardless of posture, the worst places are by far my right hip, right buttock, and right lower back. \n* **Flexibility/mobility:** Nearly perfect. I have very few issues moving and no stiffness. In a lot of cases, moving around actually feels good. The one caveat to this is my right hand which I\'ll cover in **Physical Asymmetry**.\n* **Twitching:** I have a hunch (that could absolutely be wrong) that my muscles (shoulder, arm, back, hip) twitch a little more than the normal person. It happens maybe once or twice a day but I have no idea if this is something noteworthy.\n* **Sleep:** Thankfully, most nights I am able to get to sleep without ice. Nearly every morning, like clockwork, I get a few minutes of feeling normal and quite pleasant but as soon as I start moving around or lay in bed awake for a few minutes, the pain comes back. Not sure if this is something noteworthy, either.\n* **Physical Asymmetry:** \n  * When I lay on my back, the right side of my lumber spine is noticeably further off of the ground than the left side.\n  * Raising only the middle finger in my right hand (think flipping off) is much harder to do than in my left (it\'s harder to collapse my right pointer than the left). Same with ASL ""I love you"". In general, hand motions that involve touching fingers with each other and collapsing them are much harder to do (and more painful) in my right hand than left hand. This situation my be due to the fact that I\'m left handed, though?\n  * When I lay flat on my back, fully relaxed, my right foot lays fully on the ground and my left doesn\'t lay flat. Not sure if this is normal human being stuff though.\n\n# Imaging/labs:\n\nI\'ve had two MRIs (lumbar spine in November \'20 and sacrum/pelvis in April \'21). The report for the lumbar spine says I\'ve got ""mild bilateral arthropathy"" in T12-L3 and moderate in L3-S1. The report from the sacrum/pelvis says nothing useful. These images could be uploaded if that would be helpful. \n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/a/dp148b7) is one of the X-rays that I had. Doc said that the twisting in my vertebrae could be causing some of the issue and recommended PT which had no effect after ~6 weeks.\n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/a/w11DIAT) is all of the bloodwork that I\'ve had done and from my understanding, there\'s nothing exciting here. Hopefully that\'s wrong.\n\n# Timeline:\n\n* **Nov 2019:** Jaw started clicking. In order to open it, I needed to move it to the side a little bit. Not painful or inconvenient, just different and slightly alarming. At this time, lower back started slightly hurting on *both sides* as well.\n* **Spring/Summer/Fall 2020:** Pain increased in intensity slightly. I climbed and played tennis a fair amount during this time. Sitting down in a chair to do work started to become painful. Only my back was affected at this point, I hadn\'t started feeling pain anywhere else in my body. There were a few days where my right foot would hurt slightly but it was very low intensity. \n* **Winter 2020/Spring 2021** This is about when the pain move into being exclusively on mostly my right side, right foot started to hurt much more during this time. Jaw has stopped clicking (but has started to hurt on opening) and hip has started to hurt much more.\n\nI didn\'t keep the best records during this fiasco so I apologize for the lack of details.\n\n# Attempted solutions (in no particular order):\n\n### Some relief:\n* **Ice:** Useful for *temporarily* killing pain in most intense areas.\n* **Heat:** Useful for *temporarily* killing pain in most intense areas. I ended up with erythema ab igne (hot water bottle rash) after prolonged use so I know no longer apply heat.\n* **Walking:** In Nov \'20 - Feb \'21, I\'d take daily walks (about 2 miles). They are somewhat pleasant. Pain generally subsides while on the walk but comes back afterwards.\n* **TENS Unit:** Useful for *temporarily* killing pain in most intense areas.\n* **Standing Desk:** Standing is much more bearable than sitting, especially with some comfortable shoes that I purchased but by no means is it comfortable, especially for prolonged periods.\n\n### No relief:\n* **Ibuprofen:** Works for the standard headache, muscle strain from sports, etc. but not at all for the pain I\'m trying to describe here. I\'ve tried different dose sizes and scheduled doses neither of which have efficacy.\n* **Medrol Steroid Pack:** On February 16, 2021, I had my first dose and the following day woke up in the most pain I have had. It was both the most widespread and highest intensity. No change happened after that.\n* **Glucosamine Chondroitin:** From what the rheumatologist said, GC is more of a placebo than anything. I gave it multiple multi-month attempts with no positive results.\n* **Turmeric/Circumin Supplements:** No positive results from this either.\n* **Inversion Table:** 1x/day for a few weeks aggravated my symptoms and actually hurt more than before.\n* **Copper Jewelry:** I\'ve been wearing a copper bracelet for a few weeks but to no avail. From what I\'ve seen, copper doesn\'t have medicinal effects anyways but it\'s a cheap experiment.\n* **Diet Changes:** I tried eating nothing but beef/water/salt for three weeks in December \'20 to no avail. For the last few weeks, I\'ve been eating no grains/sugar/processed foods, also to no avail. I suppose the next logical step is to completely remove animals and their byproducts and reintroduce grains?\n* **PT:** I\'ve tried multiple programs both on my own and with practitioners, none of which have worked. I have tried Stuart McGill\'s Big Three (along with most of the other things in *Back Mechanic*), the Egoscue Method, dynamic neuromuscular stabilization (DNS), and miscellaneous exercises with one of my PTs. Nothing has helped.\n* **Yoga:** Sometime in Summer \'20, I did a session everyday for two weeks with no improvement.\n* **Stretching/Rolling:** In Dec/Nov \'19 and Jan \'20 I tried multiple ""stretches for back pain""-type videos from Youtube for a few weeks at a time to no avail. I also tried some foam-rolling.\n* **Chiropractic Adjustment:** In Summer \'20, I had two sessions with my local chiropractor and received a vague diagnosis of ""inflamed facet joints"" after him seemingly doing nothing to actually arrive at this diagnosis. I decided to not continue this after feeling no different after each session.\n* **New Chairs:** I purchased a Hermann-Miller Aeron in Summer \'20 but it actually felt like it made sitting even more painful than normal. I currently have a version of the Steelcase Leap but I can\'t last longer than 5 minutes in it without ice.\n* **Medical Professionals:** I\'ve seen two orthopedic surgeons, two neurosuregons, two PTs, a chiropractor, family doc, and now a rheumatologist all of which has netted no diagnosis. I just got a letter on April 30 from Mayo\'s neurology department saying that they won\'t see me. Anybody know if this is a lost cause or if there\'s still some way to ""get in""?\n \n### Unattempted solutions:\n* **Accupuncture:** This is an expensive service but I will likely explore it soon.\n* **Steroid Injection:** I\'m not jazzed up about doing one of these with a very vague idea of why we\'re doing it. Again though, it might be worth exploring as a ~cheap~ experiment.\n* **Killing Nerves:** One of the surgeons described this procedure (I forget the jargon he used) but this doesn\'t seem like a good idea without a clear objective, especially since all of my right side hurts, not just my back. Maybe I\'m wrong.\n* **Opioids:** Highly addictive, OD possibility, etc. Not touching them under any circumstance.\n\n### Other possibly relevant facts:\n* I have seasonal allergies that last from Mid-March - Mid-May (Northern Hemisphere). They\'re probably due to juniper pollen.\n* I live in a very dry climate. We have low precipitation and low humidity. \n* Sometime in 2016, I received a diagnosis for mild scoliosis but I recently saw the diagnosing physician with an updated MRI (that I had in Nov \'20) and he didn\'t think that the scoliosis was related to the pain.\n* There hasn\'t been any particularly traumatic event (physically or psychologically) that has happened that might have caused this ordeal. The closest thing I can recall is a March \'20 ski accident but that happened after all of this started (in November \'19).\n* Seemingly regardless of my diet, for 3+ years, I have had mostly Type 1 stool according to [the Bristol stool scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_stool_scale). No idea if that\'s related.\n\nThank you for reading, I\'d be very appreciative to hear anything that you might have to say about this. Let me know if there\'s anything else that might be useful to put in this post.'"

I am on PPI medication for the GERD (diagnosed in November after an endoscopy), and I have been diagnosed with IBS for years upon a colonoscopy after the onset of symptoms over a decade ago. I was supposed to have an endoscopy at the beginning of the week, but a complication arrived - I have previously been diagnosed with Von Willebrand\'s (the mild form) and the medication I use before procedures (DDAVP nasal) was recalled according to the anesthetist office arranging the prep and appointments. I had a blood draw and the hematologist has the test results and I\'m waiting to hear back from the anesthetist folks to arrange another endoscopy with the GI results (phew!). From the relatively small amount of blood, and the red color, I would guess that I either have an ulcer or keep tearing something during the vomiting spells. Hopefully the endoscopy will confirm this, I can get treatment, and go about my life.\n\nThe thing is, I don\'t know what\'s bringing on headaches so severe that the only things that have been helping have been prescribed Vicodin and (legal, in my state) weed.\n\nSome potentially relevant things: I have had IBS symptoms following a penicillin shot around age 20. After a bout of bloody diarrhea following a week long illness, I went for the colonoscopy, started elimination diets, and so forth. My gallbladder has been tested a couple of times, the first where it was barely functional, and the second where it worked fine. I have periodic IBS flare-ups, but it has mostly been manageable so far, and while I have trigger foods I can\'t pinpoint a root cause for the flare-ups. Usually it manifests as discomfort/indigestion/diarrhea, but sometimes I throw up the contents of my stomach undigested hours after having eaten the food. I live in the USA and have decent health insurance, but not unlimited funds for wild goose chase tests. I\'d really just like to be pointed in some good directions to look for a diagnosis. I\'m happy to answer questions.\n\nDemographics: 32F, 5\'2"", 150lbs, USA, white (half immigrant from Poland), dx\'ed with bipolar and CPTSD in addition to IBS/GERD/mild von Willebrand, medication list upon private message'"

Anyways, I let it swell up and popped it once more and even had to tweeze out a gunked up piece of pus from it, it started to calm down a bit. That didnt last long though, once I popped the first one, another one formed on the other size (which I have now also tweezed a gunk of pus out of as well).

It's gotten a bit better over the last few days, but I still have these troubles. The headaches are some of the more concerning side effects, and so I've been taking acetaminophen to help out with it. The insomnia is pretty heavy too, though that might be caused by the anxiety?

Second, I dont know if this is the right subreddit to ask this in, so sorry in advance. Also, there will be a brief mention of overdosing.\nThis all slowly started happening about 3 months ago. I woke up one day, walked downstairs to get breakfast and saw my mom sitting at the table. She said good morning and tried to start a conversation, but everything felt a little off. I cant really describe it, it was sort of like she was somebody who was isolated for their entire life trying to act like an extremely social person. The feeling lasted for about 20 minutes, every interaction seemed unnatural and awkward. \nAfter the feeling went away, I didnt experience anything like it for a couple days. About half a week later, it came back, only this time it was stronger. For about 5 hours, every time I talked to anybody, it felt like they were robots trying to have a personality. Sometimes I would physically cringe when they said or did things that were just flat out annoying. I would start to feel this more frequently and more intensely until about a month ago. I was feeling really down and took about 2 grams of Zoloft, 10,000mg of acetaminophen, and 800ish mg of diphenhydramine (The chemical found in Benadryl) As a result, it triggered a weird psychotic episode that ended up getting me in an ICU after vomiting for about 11 hours. I dont remember much of the 3-4 days after the overdose besides having extremely vivid hallucinations. Once I was allowed to leave the hospital, the feeling of everybody acting like robots trying to have a personality returned, but this time it wouldnt go away. This is sort of a weird way to describe it, but it seems like everybody has the humor of a millennial. Things I didnt pay much attention to before now seem extremely abnormal. For example, talking to animals (especially if theyre using a weird voice) talking about animals in a weird voice, nicknames/pet names, explanations such as Yeah! Mocking people or saying dialogue from stories in their voice, and pretty much and informal phrases. Its been making me withdrawal socially and all my responses are always short to people in person.  \n\nTLDR; I feel like everybody is trying to fake having a personality. Its taking a huge toll on my social life, I feel like Im the only person who has feelings. \n\nPlease let me know if anything similar to this has happened to you or anybody you know.

Pre-appt antibiotics were taken before every appt. History of right-side trigeminal neuralgia (neurogenic, secondary to lupus), considered resolved in 2014. That, uncontrolled, would be a 9 on my personal pain scale, for reference. Wisdom teeth removed 20 years ago. \n\nTimeline:\n\n-Late October: Fillings were placed on #15 in late October, following acute onset unprompted pain and temperature sensitivity (cold and heat). Unprompted pain stopped and sensitivity was significantly reduced, but not resolved. \n\n\n-12/29: crown placed on #15 due to lingering sensitivity and desire to intervene before more extensive treatment would be needed (I pushed for this); no root canal performed. Immediately after the local anesthetic starts to wear off, I start to feel a severe pain, with a pressure or crushing sensation. The crown is not pressing on #14, and the gums dont show any signs of infection or flawed margins. The tooth is hypersensitive to cold and pressure; no reaction to heat or light touch. No signs of infection or abscess were noted. Pain level consistently at an 8-8.5. \n\n-1/3: no improvement in pain level when unmedicated. Pain mostly controlled when taking acetaminophen, Toradol, baclofen, and low dose opioids (all prescribed under a pre-planned protocol for the express purpose of controlling severe pain when it appears until the cause can be addressed, in hopes of avoiding triggering a neuro lupus complication that basically prompts a pain feedback loop; I can detail this further if necessary, but this event did not trigger this complication, and this is the first time Ive needed to use this protocol in 7 years). As soon as each dose starts to wear off, the pain returns full force. Toradol, as an extremely potent NSAID, has a strict 5 day limit (before the risk of organ damage and GI bleeds becomes too high), so the afternoon was the last time I was able to take this med. In the evening, I was told to take 5mg prednisone and hydroxyzine for a minor allergic reaction (completely unrelated to the dental issue).\n\n-1/4: upon waking up, even though the Toradol and other pain meds are out of my system, the pain is greatly reduced. Down to a 3-4 at most, and part of that is simply jaw pain after the past 5 days of hell. I see my dentist to check the tooth and make sure there are still no visible problems (none noted), and then my endodontist for a scheduled root canal on #21 (scheduled weeks ago). The endo also notes no obvious signs or issues, and double checks via X-ray. At this point, Ive taken 2.5mg of prednisone that morning, along with Tylenol and naproxen (taken daily for lupus arthritis). The pain has remained steady and lowered. \n\n-1/4 afternoon: 2 hours after leaving the endo, I drink some cold water and the pain in #15 immediately returns to an 8-8.5, and stays there for the rest of the day. \n\n1/5-present: Ive consistently taken 5mg prednisone, and while Ive had a brief period or 2 where the pain returned to a 6-7, it has largely stayed at or below a 3 (at most), without taking anything besides the Tylenol and naproxen I already take daily. \n\n*********************************************\nMy question: is the prednisones effect at calming the pain likely to be temporary, and should I proceed with a root canal on #15 on Monday? Or is it possible that the prednisone will solve whatever caused that pain to begin with? I need help deciding how to proceed, because I cant take Toradol again for a month (very strict instructions, and the consequences for not following them are life-threatening), and the endo typically doesnt have availability for 5-7 days after calling (at the earliest). I cant handle that level of pain, for that duration, with no relief (if the prednisone doesnt work next time).\n\n*Edited to add: Ive never smoked, and I havent had any alcohol since before this started. I only drink socially and infrequently. \n\nAlso, I dont blame my dentist or anyone else; theyve been wonderful. Weird medical issues, especially involving cranial/facial nerves, arent new for me. I fully believe this problem was prompted by my pre-existing medical issues.'"

Then my psychiatrist retired and my therapist shortly after due to COVID. I essentially have to start from scratch and I just took my last pill last week.\n\nRegardless of these facts I\'ve been extremely high functioning my entire life. Juggling multiple extra-curricular activities in high school, etc. Even now, I work full time (Financial Consultant), an studying full time (MA in Econ/MSc in IT), and juggle two businesses I both found and run. Though sometimes I get run down and let these things all falter at once even knowing I have the capability to juggle them all.

We had been talking about me tailing a trip to Houston to love and work with her for a few weeks to a month just to rekindle things but she backs out and ghosts me again every-time it\'s the day of. This has been going on since mid-February. It is now Mid-April. I think she\'s cheating but I just make an effort to try and believe what she tells me and leave it to her conscious (if she has one) to sort the rest out. It got so bad that she blocked me completely from everything with no explanation for 24 hours and I felt so down about myself that I wrote a suicide note with my Will included for my family to find in case I needed it. Downed a bottle of Red wine and a few Advil PMs hoping I wouldn\'t wake up. I ended up calling the suicide hotline twice that night (they were no help btw). She answered finally after I bugged her to death the next day and I had hope that things were resolved (I was delusional). \n\nIn addition to my girl problems, I have been waiting 18 months for a promotion at my company that I was previously granted. Some loophole in our company policy blocked me from being about to take the position until March of 2021 (Hired Sept 2019, Promoted Dec 2019). Due to COVID we now work permanently from home. Just last week I interviewed for the position again as a formality as it was suggested that I pretty much already had the gig. This was the same day I was pleading for my fianc to unblock me and give me some explanation. She eventually did later that day as I mentioned but my head was all over the place  going into the interview. I got news on Friday that they went with another candidate and I\'m starting now to feel as if there is a larger motive by my bosses to keep my undervalued and underpaid.

I have 2 bachelor\'s degrees in related fields, my Series 7 and 63, and minimum 5 years experience.\n\nNeedless to say these things combined with running out of meds, among other things that are too long to explain, have caused me to break down and start making drastic decisions.

I know form experience I won\'t get ahold of her in time to set up my equipment at her place, clock in, and complete my shift. I risked my job for this trip and it\'s the dumbest thing I\'ve done so far this decade. And I did it off of an impulsive decision and blind trust in my woman. Or was it self sabotage? \n\nI\'m now considering leaving my job cold turkey before they can follow me, breaking the engagement off with my fianc, spending the engagement ring money on a well-deserved two week vacation out of the country (first time, am vaccinated), and coming back to start my own practice, focus on my businesses, and finish my studies. It sounds wonderful in my head but I can\'t decide if these thoughts are a result of me just wanting more for myself out of life, or if it is self sabotage and I\'m purposefully derailing my life out of self-hate and depression as a result of my disorder. The worst part is that I\'m also afraid that I may be subconsciously pushing myself to my own suicide on foreign land. Or doing impulsive things and hoping as a result I die as a result of my own reckless behavior. This wouldn\'t be the first time and I desperately want to believe that I am making the right set of decisions. \n\nPlease advise.

This is normal. It doesnt happen to everyone. It might happen for shorter or longer periods of time. Theres nothing to predict how long your purge will last. You may find that you purge in places that you didnt previously have acne. Again normal. \n\n- You arent going to die if you drink alcohol. And no, the medicine will continue to work. You should of course try and restrict how much you drink as Accutane can affect peoples liver. Just use your brain. If you have an absolute bender one night, thats okay. Drink some water and move on. You will survive. \n\n- Im taking 5mg once a month (not literally). Yeah its probably not going to work wonders. Although there is often method in the madness, talk to your Derm about what their long term plan is for you and dont bother asking on here. \n\n- Yes that rash on your hand is probably from Accutane. Get some moisturiser on it and crack on. \n\n- Ive been taking Accutane for a week and Ive still got spots. Of course you do. Your skin cycle is at least a month normally (although this is being sped up by taking Accutane) so you are very unlikely to experience immediate results. Some people do see changes quickly, others take half a year before they even see any changes. Again, it all relative. Keep going or dont, its up to you. \n\n- I weigh three stone and Im on 200mg per day, is this too much. Aye yeah of course it is.  Youre going to end up like a raisin Im sure. Probably worth talking to your Derm. \n\n- Yes, dry lips are normal and are to be expected. Stick some aquaphor on and move on. If that doesnt work for you try something else. \n\n- Ive just spent three hours on a sun bed trying to go brown for my hols, should I be worried? Yes of course you should. You are so much more likely to burn than you would have been before taking Accutane. Why are you spending all this time and effort trying to fix your skin and then actively trying to damage it a different way? Seems counterintuitive. Have a summer off. \n\nWhat have I missed? \n\nAgain, its all in jest but come on guys. '"

She said she had the same problems.   \n\n\nIt was the first time I was able to get through a whole day of work and not be sleepy or distracted or stuck staring at a wall which is super important because my job is essentially content creating and my money depends on my work ethic  however I didn't know how it worked and took it really late in the day, Like 5pm with an energy drink so I was up till the morning the next day, lasted at least 14 hours. She had also gave me one Adderall (20MG) to try which i took a week later to try (even though i think she takes them together) which my body did not take well to, had headaches, spacey, heart racing and the focus was not sufficient at all.  After that it took me a year to finally get the diagnosis from a neuropsychologist and coverage for vyvanse.  \n\n\nSo I started on 30MG, and the first days were awful. I didn't experience a crash like this before so it was unexpected. After only 3 hours I was feeling extreme depression, and 8 hours after my anxiety spiked (so bad my chest felt tight) and it just didn't last long enough (only 3 hours active time tops). It also didn't keep me awake, I took one 30MG one day and was able to sleep through the entire active time.  I need at least 8 hours of productivity and no daytime sleepiness. So I doubled the dose (2 30MG/60MG at once) and that lasted the 8 hours actively I needed almost exactly (not including the 2 hours for it to kick in)  and I had no depression side effects or very very mild by bedtime. I also had no anxiety spikes on this dose. , but I had trouble getting to sleep at night, even though I was taking it around 10:30am and stopped caffeine (protein coffee only, i no longer drink energy drinks) intake before 5pm. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(also keep in mind, i'm not taking it daily. I actually have about 8 30MG pills left. I hate the idea of being dependent on medication... I barely even take tylenol or advil unless the pain is unbearable and I have diagnosed anxiety after 2 panic attacks put me in the hospital but refused to refill my zoloft because I hated how I felt on it even though it worked. I've been able to mitigate my anxiety with breathing techniques and my dogs, i don't have anxiety everyday, only when dealing with a lot. So I really only want to take it for content days which require the most work and focus and days I want to be really active with my son like take him out somewhere and be attentive to him)\n\nCurrent problem:\n\nSo i asked my Dr to maybe give me slightly less than 60MG to try and he prescribed me 50MG. Well this is my first day taking it, took it at 10:30am with no coffee close to taking it and by 4:30 I noticed it basically worn off. So that's only an active time of 4 hours for me. I have only gotten half of what I needed to do today done. :(   I just drank a protein coffee at 4:30pm when I felt it starting to wear off so I'm not tired now, but most of the focus and motivation is gone. I don't understand how the 10mg could make that drastic of a difference. I also didn't feel the boost in energy as much as I did on the 60mg.  \n\n\nSo I'm wondering is it because I didn't drink my protein coffee closer to the dose like I did before (when i took the 60mg, i would drink my protein coffee exactly 2-3 hours after taking it) or can 10mg really make a huge difference? I have had break days between, sometimes multiple days in between so I don't think its dependence that fast. Or maybe because I didn't eat anything until the 4:30 protein coffee shake? Or maybe because I just didn't get much sleep last night?   \n\n\nI read on here that some people take boosters, but I'd really rather not take additional medications and don't know if I will be covered for double doses of smaller amounts (plus i'm really bad about taking meds on time). So other than boosters, is there anything natural you do to make it last longer? \n\nAny similar experiences?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n((sorry for the long post, this is my first one so I wanted to provide detail.

I apparently have quite a small mouth (I have been told this by several dentists in the past), and **1 oz. of fluid is far too much for me to be able to ""vigorously swish"" between my teeth**: my cheeks bulged like a hamster just trying to hold it in.  The problem only got worse over the course of the minute as my mouth produced additional saliva, leading me to spend the final 20 seconds holding my head over the sink in case in case it became too much for my lips to hold in.  When my 1 minute timer was up, I spat out approximately half and then was finally able to ""vigorously swish"" as I should have been doing all along. \n\n\nAfterwards I checked the instructions for the non-prescription mouth rinse that I was using previously (sodium fluoride 0.02%): I have never measured it out, but the bottle advises ""vigorously swishing"" with 10 ml, which is a significantly smaller volume at only about 1/3 of 1 oz. \n\n\nI also gave 1 oz of water to my (presumably normal-sized mouth!) partner to swish as a test, and he confirmed that this was at the absolute upper end of what he could actively swish in his mouth - which surprised me even further, as the bottle\'s instructions apply to children as young as 6, who surely have far smaller mouths than we do. \n\n\nI\'m confused about how to proceed from here.   **Should I cut the amount of water to a comfortable level and swish with a more viscous rinse to achieve the same total dose?  Or should I scale down both the concentrate and the water to maintain the same 1:7 ratio?**\n\n\nDon\'t worry, I will be contacting my dentist for their advice when they re-open on Monday!!  In the meantime I am very curious to know if anyone else has come across this problem and is therefore able to advise on how I should proceed this weekend, especially while my mouth is at its most sensitive immediately following SRP.'"

Sorry about this post but I need to tell it somewhere because I think it can help me.\nI am 18. Since I can remember Ive been struggling with things in my life. I was always a weird kid, I had friends and I have a good contact with them till now I do not have problems talking with people most of the time. But I am weird. At least that is what people say. But Id like to start from the beginning I think. \nSo back in the early days of high school I was a very very quiet kid. But not shy. Ive always loved talking about useles stuff with people. Nothing that would make me friends with them but more like weird things. I am not sure how it looked back then because I cannot remember but that is how I felt. Ive been suicidal. I am not sure how much or even if that was real. Ive been listening to Kurt cobein sometimes I talked about this stuff and it might be weird to other. Basically a depressed teenager. Nothing special. During this time I think I started or just I am not able to remember stuff that now seems odd. Like being obsessed with friends. Like sometimes I was really paranoid with them like why they do not like me and they are not taking me with them. This are some old memories from this times. Other memories just vanished. Like I cant really remember what I was doing then. Only a few girls who I had crush on and it was odd also. Ive always thought to myself that it is just teenage stuff or maybe slight depression that I can cope with. I tried to consume as much information on this as possible. Like Ted talks about stuff like that and other things. I wanted to know what is going on. I did not thought to go to a therapist at all.\nFew years later i catches a feeling to my friend that I have been friends since childhood. I thought nothing special just awkward kid who cannot really do social interactions very well. Once I told her in a weird way that Id like to be her boyfriend. She reacted weirdly. She rejected me and she was trying to be nice. And I was living my life just fine. But since she was and she still is my friend we were doing stuff together. I promise I am getting to the point here. So she was acting like once she is interested in me like talking nice stuff and saying things that I should stay with her or sth. 6 months after that she actually invited me on a date I think. We went on a walk 2 times. I think I was acting totally fine. Like talking about Norma stuff nothing weird I promise. I was just happy that she wanted to meet me. After that she didnt want to go out with me anymore. Nothing special that how it works I think. And from there I started to losing my mind. Like firstly I was fine but it looked like at least for me , I really tried to move on but I couldnt, that she feels something towards me. And I wasnt able to think straight. I was literally obsessed with her. Not in any creepy way. Like she was always on my mind. After almost every drink that I had I was crying. Especially when she was around. My mood was really really bad when it looked like she doesnt like me or very good when suddenly it looked like it is the other way. I know it sounds weird like hell. But I promise I felt this too. I just couldnt stop it. Having mental breakdowns cutting myself and once even talking to me if the cut would be deep enough that I can bleed out I wont do anything about it Id like to die. This thought were always there. I can remember that few years back I was standing in the kitchen with a knife to my wrests but this was like coping mechanisms for me. I am not sure if I would be ever able to do that. And now 1 and a half year after all this with her started I still am dependent on her. I was doing lsd few times. Tried codeine a few times. I was drinking a lot. I can call myself a reckless driver. I have a really big mood swings. I am able to get up from bed and be like wowow what am I doing this is crazy let gets something done and I fell fucking grwat. Or if I text someone or her and a conversation goes in a certain seat that makes me feel better it changes my day like 190 degrees. But there are days that I am not able to do stuff like I am crying and I think about suicdie and her and aaaah isnt frustrating. In this point I am not sure if this is about her because I think I had this feeling about other girls. This weird obsession. Mood swings dependent on stuff that is going on with relations with other people. Ive been to a psychologist once and I told him what I was feeling in that exact moment but I feel like it was just a glimpse of what I felt there and then. Sometimes I feel like talking to someone or going on a ride or changing a room or going out could make me a really happy person but getting back to my room is bad almost always. The doctor said I should find somebody that tests people with autism spectrum that are adults because he things it might be a problem and since then I think there are things that make me think about stuff different then others  and there is that thing when even little noises could make me really really frustrated but I do not know what to do. I just feel bad . I do not want to write anymore because nobody will probably read that so if you did thanks you can let me know what so you think about me and tell me something nice. Love you'"

My eight year old daughter was recently diagnosed after a couple of assessments.  The psych spoke with her for 10 minutes and noticed most of the classic childhood ADHD behaviors.  He followed that up by having 3 people fill out a questionnaire on her behavior.  Us, plus we gave it to her current (3rd grade) and 2nd grade teacher.  \n\nShe\'s an otherwise super happy, super smart kid.  As time has passed though, she\'s shown more and more signs of difficulty paying attention, so my wife and I thought this was coming.  She was super resistant to meds at first, but eventually agreed to take them, which struck me as odd.\n\nI have an undergrad psych degree and no problem with administering prescribed meds as directed by a licensed physician, but my mom though.  She\'s become more and more of a crunchy granola type as she\'s gotten older.  She\'s always been pretty anti psychoactive meds/pharma (except the meds she likes/uses like Advil, Tramadol, and a handful of others ... consistency is not her strong suit).  She also loves my kids like crazy and sees them most weekends so my wife and I can get a date night in.  I can\'t stress enough how sweet and loving she is though.  She\'s really the archetypal grandma in many ways right down to baking and spoiling them.\n\nAnyway, I talked with her on the phone about my kid\'s diagnosis and she got all sad and started talking about zombie kids and how she was disappointed.  That one I pushed back on.  ""Disappointed in what, mom?"" I asked her.  And I told her that if she wants to watch the kids, she needs to give her meds as prescribed, full stop.  Anyway she continued to be all sad and morose at me telling me that my daughter\'s behavior wasn\'t so bad but like ... people, it\'s pretty clear if you watch her.  Eventually my daughter mentioned that her negative attitude toward meds may have come from her grandmother.\n\nAnyway, I\'m feeling super anxious right now and worried for my girl.  I love her so damn much, and I just want her to be able to be okay in school and able to focus.  Have any of you had positive experiences with meds in grade school?

After waking up once i get moving the pain goes away slowly until i dont notice it anymore. To note, I had hip pain first (hip flexor i believe) from working out and have been diligent in doing stretches to relieve both pains in my hip and my back. The stretches reduce the pain but its still there. Ive taken advil and cbd since they reduce inflammation but i dont think it is inflammation due to the pain still being there. Using heat seems to work a bit, heat pads and ointments keep that pain down but still present. \n\nWhere is it:\nI would say T-11 to T-12 if I were to number the spine? It happens to be a sharp throbbing pressure pain. If I were to have the pain on and do yoga, it would hurt to be in a cobra position. Then after a couple of sets of the cobra and Im more active, the pain just dissipates and is gone. The back muscle feels fatigued and I do feel a certain pressure pain in that area when Im sleeping and 5 hours in Id wake up to the pain.\n\n\nHistory:\nIve never had any back problems arise before, and I have bought a Posture corrector, its quite nice since my shoulders are more rounded, I do get told that I slouch quite a bit due to having a big bones and wide shoulders. Ive been using it for awhile, my posture seems a lot straighter than before however the pain still resides.\n\nExtra: \nI tried 3 different mattresses and pillows to no avail, the pain still resides.

Im currently at a loss and would like to sleep normally again. \n\nThank you for your time and consideration. Any help would be much obliged! '"

I\'m just outlining the basics here. I\'ve got a mountain of diagnostics behind all of this, but I\'m keeping it out of the OP as I don\'t want to introduce any bias. I\'ve written and re-written out my history more times than I can recall, and it always ends up being 50 pages, list form, just to get through the medical history.\n\nI\'ve had at least 20 different diagnoses, all incorrect or just un-provable. I\'m not a fan of cop-out disease spectrums like ""CFS"". Fuck that shit. There\'s a real pathophysiology behind that name somewhere, and I\'ve seen terms like it get thrown around due to laziness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\'ve also spent the past decade doing arm-chair medical research (yea no... not hypothyroid-mom/naturalnews guys...). I\'ve read probably over 5000 papers on subjects relating to my symptoms/onset/progression. I\'ve made tones of connections, but at the same time, part of the disease is fairly frequent cognitive impairment, and an almost complete inability to form new memory from pure data (this is a whole long story as well, but essentially I can\'t remember shit. Instead, I\'ve resorted to learning to develop new concepts, and it actually works out pretty well for many things, but trolling through 5000 papers and being unable to retain individual data points, makes it near impossible for me to compute my way out of this). I am confident that given the data I have available to me currently, if I could plug it all into a simply stupid neural net, it\'d laugh at me and have the answer instantly. I am nearly positive that sufficient data exists to solve this, I just lack the memory to keep it all in mind long enough to cross reference it all. \\*sigh\\*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is sorta a bounty. I\'m at a point in my life where I have enough money to survive a few years without work, but at the same time, if I get any worse, I won\'t be able to work at all. I currently work from home, and even that is a challenge and I cannot be terribly reliable. If I can\'t solve this at all, I\'ll have no use for my savings. At 36 I should be roughly in my prime. My prime was instead, the day before the initial onset, in my early 20\'s. Since then, you might as well consider me 85 years old. Honestly, I know 85 yo\'s with more energy to do stuff than I have currently (and I\'m having a relatively good few months). I can\'t give an exact figure, but I can guarantee that if someone figures this out, they won\'t feel like they\'ve wasted their time.\n\n\\*\\*History:\\*\\*36, male, Caucasian. 6\'3"" - 6\'5"" (depends on the day), 150 - 210lbs (depends on the week). Currently in the PNW, but have lived all over Canada.So very long story, as thus far, over 100 gp\'s/specialists haven\'t figured out anything, and coincidentally, precisely 0 have heard even a complete list of symptoms, let alone family history or potential environmental factors. I strongly suspect that family history and/or environmental history may be important, but describing my history would require a few volumes so I\'ll try to keep it as concise as possible.\n\nSo, I had asthma and allergies as a child. Grew up on a farm which probably didn\'t help. Around age 12 I got kicked outta my house and sorta wandered around until I ran into my biological father with whom I stayed for a year or so until he went for coffee and never came back ;). It was about that time that I started smoking, and it didn\'t occur to me then, but it\'s blatantly obvious in retrospect, that is exactly the time my asthma and allergies disappeared.I worked hard manual labour for most of my young life, from age 8 to around 22. From oil field, digging ditches, chipping tar off industrial furnaces and building pool tables. Throughout all of that though, I was always extremely healthy.Somewhere around age 20, I got sick for the first time in years. Throat hurt like mad. I hadn\'t been to a doctor in almost a decade until then. They gave me a prescription I couldn\'t afford and didn\'t tell me what was wrong. An ex-GF came to the rescue and pointed out to my dumb ass that there are generics for 1-20th the price. Got that, and got better.A few years later I finally started getting my shit together. Built myself into a career (IT management), was generally stable for a bit. I was extremely active my entire life.Somewhere in my mid-20\'s (I believe I was working at IBM at that point), I started experiencing a mild loss of visual acuity as well as throat constriction in the late afternoon to early evening. It was consistent in it\'s timing, but severity was increasing over a few months. Ultimately we figured I had Hashimotos (confirmed with antibody tests). Synthroid fucking raped me. First 88mcg dose landed me in the ER, thinking I was having a heart attack. Everyone insisted nothing was wrong and told me to continue taking it. At that point I had none of the hallmark symptoms. Certainly not a loss of energy, but I didn\'t know any better at the time so I just listened to my docs. The panic attacks following each dose lasted for months, but the throat constriction and visual acuity issues did resolve about 50%.Stuff was mostly normal for 2 years, until age around 25. At that point I was in the best physical condition of my life. I\'d  been weight training and had finally managed to gain some mass. I was up to 205lbs (6\'5""). I was running a marathon a week, plus several km/day, plus hardcore mountain biking a few days a week, plus yoga, rock climbing, long boarding, on top of my regular weight training. I\'ve only ever met one man who could outrun/outlast me when I was at that point. I think this may also point to a hint though. My strength, for my size, was commonly referred to as ""retard strength"", and running 40km didn\'t have me breathing hard. I felt pretty much invincible, unless you kicked me in my shins, my only weakness. At that point I was eating at least 4000 calories/day on my slow days, and also still smoking a pack a day.\n\nThen, cause girl, I quit smoking. Two weeks later my life pretty much (entirely) ended. I woke up with my eyes bloodshot and itchy as all hell. I figured a cat must\'ve licked me in the eye-balls or something while I was asleep so thought nothing of it, figuring it\'d resolve on it\'s own. Happened that myself and the girl were going on vacation starting that day, so we headed to the coast. 3 days in, I realised I hadn\'t shat since we left and my gut was starting to get distended. 2 days later still nothing, and distention was up to around 10"". On the drive home, there was an audible \\*pop\\* (GF heard it over the truck) and I immediately blacked out. Got to the nearest ER, nothing wrong apparently.\n\nWent to my doc back home and he insisted that I just wasn\'t eating well and not getting enough exercise, so I gave up on him, given he knows my average day. Tried another, and another, and then 4 more. Most insisted nothing was wrong and told me to ignore the symptoms. Next morning I woke up blind. My vision was completely white for about 10 minutes, then spontaneously resolved. Still itchy and blood shot, but I could see normally. I decided to take matters into my own hands and quit gluten. 2 days later I pooped. And immediately passed out on the toilet, and woke up on the floor. From that point on, I have had 1/100th my previous energy/endurance. It was like a light switch. And when I say 1/100th, that is not an exaggeration whatsoever. I went from being able to run 40km in a stretch, to being barely able to walk to my truck to get to work, and then requiring help to get up the half flight of steps to my office. I\'d feel like shit when I got in, at about 10 or 11 am I\'d finally have to poop (explosively), which would result in passing out, or at least blacking out on the toilet. I\'d do that 4-6x over the course of an hour or two, and then I\'d go nap at my desk until around 2pm. Then I\'d wake up and feel better progressively throughout the day. Usually by 7 or 8pm I\'d feel like I wasn\'t dying, but still have very little energy. This went on for several years before the severity decreased and things stabilised a little. Throughout that time I saw >60 doctors and specialists (none every found anything wrong with me), tried multiple elimination diets (not sure if any worked, but I landed on a diet of steak/potatoes/blueberries/coconut oil and that\'s all I eat now).It took me YEARS before I finally thought back to when this all started, and the only two changes in my life  prior to onset, were quitting smoking, and new GF. Tested various possibly theories regarding something sexually transmitted, but everything was always negative. On paper, I was extremely healthy. So I finally tried smoking cigarettes again. The next day I woke up feeling better than I had in 5 years. I decided to keep smoking as much as I could for 3 months to see what happened, and throughout that time, I essentially went into remission. The symptoms were still there, but the severity was decreased 90%. I could go for walks again, occasionally I could even jog a little. I stopped passing out after taking a shit or going from sitting to standing, etc. So my 3 months came up and ""for the science"", I quit smoking again. First day without cigarettes and every symptom increased in severity by 2-3x, and another 2-3x the day after. I for some reason, kept not smoking for about a year before I finally tried it again, and it was a year of absolute hell. Constant panic attacks, severe IBS, zero energy, all my joints started to hurt, eyes bloodshot and itchy, substantial cognitive deficit, etc.Started smoking again, and as before, severity of all symptoms decreased dramatically. For some reason I keep thinking I\'m fooling myself, so I quit smoking again and die for a year before I remember to smoke. I to this day, still dont\' know what I think about this.\n\nSo, that\'s the gist of the story. There is MUCH more to it than that, but I think that\'s the important history.As for symptoms:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chronic/Constant (never resolves completely):**\n\n* **Fatigue, lack of endurance.** I still have the retard strength, but only for a few seconds at a time.\n* **IBS (or something)**. This waxes and wanes dramatically. At best, I\'ll have 2-3 days a year where my poop is normal. The norm is to poop 2-5x per morning, feel super weak for a few hours, and slowly recover. At worst, it\'s either 6+x in the morning and then constant stabbing pains in the GI, or constipation for days or sometimes over a week.\n* **Edema?** \\- This is a weird one. Legs absolutely do not look like the have edema, but any small amount of pressure on them for a few seconds, leaves a clear dent for 15-20 minutes. EG: if I have my calf rested on the coffee table and the edge is touching at all, it\'ll leave a very clear impression of the table in my leg for at least 15 minutes. I can just grab my leg anywhere below the knee and squeeze for a few seconds, and leave a hand print for 15 minutes. Looks really strange if I\'ve been sitting cross legged in the driveway , as it\'ll leave a perfect imprint of the asphalt and it looks like my leg is falling apart.  \nBut, it absolutely does not look like edema is present until the intent is in place. I finally recently managed to convince my latest NP to let me hang out for 2 minutes with my leg slightly rested against her desk, to show her the intent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chronic/intermittent (comes and goes, but is most often present.**\n\n* **Flu like symptoms**. Extreme fatigue/malaise. I describe it to people as ""the worst flu you\'ve ever had, and then just bump it up a few more notches"". I\'ve never found anything which obviously precedes onset. I just wake up and my week is screwed. Zero chance of doing anything. Sometimes lasts months, and in one case for almost 2 years. Other times it lasts 2 hours and resolves completely and entirely spontaneously.\n* **Small red/purple dots on lower legs**. Looks like petechiae. When they resolve, I\'m left with what looks like a strange scar. I tricked my Internist into biopsying one of them, and he says results say it\'s ""some kind of granulomatos vasculitis"", but did not follow up.\n* **Brain fog**. This term gets thrown around a lot and I used to think it was a bad term, but there\'s really nothing better suited to describe it. The world feels hazy. I know my cognitive function is impaired, so something is still working well enough to know something is wrong in the brain compartment, but not well enough to focus on, and/or solve complex tasks.\n* **Heart palpitations/bradycardia/tachycardia.** This comes and goes often. Is near constant in terms of, it happens quite a few times on almost all days. Some days it just doesn\'t stop. Took me years to figure out though that when it begins, I can make it stop in an instant by simply crouching down. I\'ll be working on my truck, or standing at my desk, or walking in a store and my heart rate will jump up to 150-170bpm instantly. I crouch down and it beats 4 or 5 more times and then light a switch, it\'s instantly back to 60-70bpm. There is no ramp down time. It changes from one beat to the next. Instant resolution nearly 99% of the time.\n* **Panic attacks**. These were frequent at early onset, then disappeared for years, and then came back again for a few more years (constant, every day, every hour), and then decreased in severity beginning last year, and now mostly gone again.\n* **Asthma**. If I quit smoking, I have severe asthma that is not controllable with salbutamol nor corticosteroids. If I start smoking again, it resolves completely within\' a few days.\n* **Extreme post-meal drowsiness**. I eat, and almost immediately need a nap for an hour or so. Cannot keep my eyes open.\n* S**trange sensation of emptiness in gut.** When this occurs, drinking any water results in panic attacks. Eating resolves the sensation temporarily, but I can eat a full meal and my stomach and upper GI feel completely empty again in 15 minutes. Sounds a lot like dumping syndrome.\n* **Abdominal bloating/distension**. So far we\'ve never found any cause for it. 10"" distension and nothing on ultrasound.\n* **Severe lower back and mid back pain**. L5-S1 area, and between shoulder blades. Confirmed there are very mild herniations or moderate bulges in both locations, but according to everyone thus far, nowhere near enough to account for any of my symptoms. The pain alternates between the left and right sides of each joint, and when it starts, just walking around carefully will result in severe, but intermittent stabbing pains. Being careful doesn\'t seem to have any affect on whether or not this devolves to the point where I cannot sit or stand. Some times it just goes away after a few days, other times I\'ll need help getting to the bathroom as the pain is so severe it causes me to just black out. I have an absurdly high pain tolerance, but this is like nothing else. Being stabbed through the hand I just shrugged off. Walking on a broken leg 20km, and having to climb a mountain to get out of the bush, no problem by comparison. This is the kind of searing pain that I just can\'t describe any other way other than ""my body just says ""fuck this shit"" and shuts down my brain"". I have no control over it.  I can tell when it\'s going to happen,  days in advance. There is no discomfort, just a feeling of weakness in the skeletal muscles or something. If I am extremely careful, I might avoid a full blown stabbing attack. I dunno.\n* **Itchy eyes**. No idea what causes this. Eyes just get incredibly itchy usually on the inside corners and nothing resolves it. They get bloodshot and look very mildly infected. If I do nothing about it, I go blind. Once it starts, I just flood them with synthetic tear stuff and colloidal silver until it resolves usually a week later. 100% of the time I do nothing, it never resolves.\n* **Random stabbing pains**. Everywhere. In my brain, chest, arms, legs, and a particular part of my anal sphincter (right side, and it\'s the only place that\'s consistent). Happens quite often but usually only a few times in a day. Severe pain lasting half a second. Makes me fall off the couch, or loose my hold on a rock while climbing, thus I can\'t climb anymore as I can\'t trust my shit to not just let go.\n* **Feeling like I\'m not getting enough oxygen**. This is relatively rare, but always distrubing. My O2 saturation is normal each time, but feels like I\'m running on half a lung. Spontaneously resolves 10 minutes later.\n* **Zero appetite**, but gut goes to hell if I don\'t eat every few hours. If I don\'t get a good 50/50 mix of protien and starch within\' 5 hours, I start shaking, getting super weak, vision goes dark, and i\'ll eventually just lose consciousness.\n* The list could go on for days, but these are the common ones. I\'ll add more if/when I think of them.\n* See, right there I forgot one of the biggest symptoms. **Inability for form new memory.** This waxes and wanes in severity, but is constant. At it\'s worst, it\'s Memento. On average, it just means I can\'t retain new facts. I strongly feel this has gone on for so long that my brain actually rewired itself in a way in which I am more easily able to create new concepts than I am able to retain a single fact. I argue constantly, and I know I\'m mostly full of shit because I cannot retain data, but conceptually I just ""get"" things now. It makes me appear somewhat stupid to most people, but able to pull correct summations out of my ass with regularity (because conceptually I get it, even if I can\'t remember it).\n\n**Diet:**\n\nI eat potatos, red meat, blueberries, coconut oil, chives, salt, and a coconut protein powder. Nothing else. I\'ve eaten nothing else in the past year, and it\'s been one of my most stable years. I\'m sure that I can occasionally eat other foods without any issue, but most of the time they seem to make my gut hurt almost immediately, and cause severe GI issues for the next week.I also went a year without red meat, and instead substituted with baby birds. That seemed to go okay as well, but the thought of eating another bird makes me pretty much puke in my mouth a little. For whatever reason, red meat and pork, while I\'m super sick of both, don\'t disgust me yet.I am absolutely sick of eating. I hate it. I\'m never hungry, but I know if I don\'t force feed myself, I\'ll start dying in a few hours. Eating is a chore. I feel like it\'d be less a chore if I could eat anything goddamned else, but I\'m too paranoid to try anything, given I seem to have severe reactions occasionally to things that I\'m fine with on other days.I\'ve never had any apparent reaction to meat/potatoes/blueberries/chives/coconut oil, so I stick with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Exercise:**\n\nRapes me. If I intentionally try to go for a run, or especially if I try to do any weight lifting or anything that would normally result in an increase in muscle mass, I\'m fucked for at least a week, usually two. Everything starts to hurt 2-3 days after any strenuous activity, and results in almost all the symptoms I\'ve experienced, increasing in severity by a few factors, for a week or two. I become non-functional.Very occasionally, I\'ll wake up and know I\'m okay to work out. I\'ll do so, and I\'ll feel fantastic, and have no detrimental effect. This occurs about once a year, for 3-4 days.When I\'m having an only somewhat abnormally good day, I can get away with doing some very light work out. IE: I can do some knee/leg lifts while holding myself up tucked into the corner of the counter, and it feels AMAZING. I can\'t do sit ups or any yoga as they\'ll both destroy my back for a few months.\n\nOn the rare occasion I do work out, I\'m always blown away by the fact that I actually LOOK healthy. Like, I look like I\'ve been working out and lifting weights with regularity all my life. It\'s like nothing ever went wrong. (and this is probably the crux of dealing with doctors, as they absolutely can\'t believe me about how dead I really am inside, when I seem outwardly, to look to be in ridiculously good physical condition).\n\n**Coordination/spacial awareness:**\n\nGoing for a walk on most days, most of my joints either hurt or just don\'t feel right. My coordination is definitely impaired. Prior to disease, I was an elf. I had no problem running up tree and doing a back-flip, or hucking my bike 40\' and pancaking out. Now, I have to very consciously calculate the intended trajectory of my knees, then feet, in order to walk like a human. If I\'m not thinking about it, I\'m clumsy. I stumble, stub my toe into the ground (I\'ve broken every toe several times each due to this), stomp, or flail. I feel like Elon Musk trying to imitate a human, every time I walk. \\*Ah, this is how a human do, so shall I too, do\\*. That actually goes through my head every time I walk to the store.Again, this is all transient. On a good day, I can probably parkour here, I can parkour there. I can parkour in a box, I can parkour with a fox. On an average day I\'ll fall over if I\'m not actively paying attention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Allergies:**\n\nNo idea. I had severe (anaphylactic) reactions to peanuts and horses when I was young, but those seemed to go away somewhere around age 12. Up until a few years ago, I still ate a few normal foods. Apples (the ones with the dull red that taste terrible) always made my mouth itchy and gave me a bit of a stomach ache. The shiny red once (macintosh?) were sometimes fine, and sometimes made my mouth itchy.On paper, according to IgE/IgG tests, I\'m deadly allergic to everything (test was about 8 years ago), but that included foods I was eating regularly at the time, and not completely dying. According to prick tests, I\'m only allergic to some grasses.I went full potato (ha! A PUN!) with the elimination diet test. I don\'t recall the specifics of the first test, but I stuck to 3 foods total, for 4 months. Then switched to 3 totally unrelated foods (ie: no known cross reactivity) for another 4 months. Not sure I ever noticed a difference.\n\n**Random:**\n\nOn a side note, the first few years I felt severely nauseous. It lasted for 2 or 3 years where I felt like I was going to vomit 100% of the time. I have not puked since I was 15 though (last time I drank a Newfie under the table).I\'m not sure if I ever actually ""get sick"". It would be very hard to differentiate between a flu and my regular day. I\'m either invincible, or everything is so perfectly fucked up that I\'ve gone all Mr. Burns and my shit\'s all just in perfect horrible balance.\n\nOkay, so I don\'t want to get into detail on the diagnostics we\'ve got so far, nor any of the theories I\'ve covered, as I dont\' want to introduce bias. I will provide diagnostic results if anyone has any to request.  I\'ve got about 200  pages of diagnostics. Mostly normal, some obviously abnormal. The only thing I want to hint at is that a lot of the diagnostics strongly suggest SLE (Lupis), but as we know, it\'s never Lupis.\n\nI will also point out that, by crazy coincidence or otherwise, both my mother and father seem to have the same disease. Similar onsets, similar spectrum of symptoms, similar progression. Also, everyone on my dads side of the family is right messed up with the same issues, except 100% of those who were life-long smokers. They live to 100 and are all driving race cars until someone tells them in their late 90\'s that they are too old for race cars.\n\nI\'ve now seen over 100 docs/specialists. Honestly though, and I don\'t want to be that guy who says everyone but me is stupid, but over 90% of the useful diagnostics I\'ve got on paper, came from me stealing diagnostic requisitions to test my own theories. I apparently look too healthy, so docs don\'t take me seriously, even when I bring them diagnostics in hand, to prove something has gone horribly awry. Not a single one of my docs has looked at past diagnostics, most haven\'t ordered any themselves, and almost all are 100% convinced this is all just hypothyroidism, or purely psychosomatic. Every time they say that, I try to show them the labs that prove otherwise (there are many), and they outright refuse to look at them. Something isn\'t right there. Hell, I\'ve had chronic GI issues since day one and I haven\'t been able to convince any doc to order me and endoscopy. Diagnostics strongly suggest celiac is a thing, which I understand is supposed to be confirmed by a followup upper endo, but no doc agrees that such confirmation is of any value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*My life currently:\\*\\***\n\nI lucked out like mad. As I was homeless for a number of years, so working from home, making a decent living on my own hours, having a savings, etc, is pretty fantastic. If I hadn\'t got into the career I did, at the time I did, I would be dead. Zero question of that. There is precisely no possibility of me ""going to work"" at this point, nor at any time since the initial onset.I have enough energy once in a while that I can go out 4x4ing or something as long as I\'m careful to not get busted and have to roll around under my truck. If/when that happens, I rely 100% on someone else to help me get home, as any physical exertion and I\'ll just pass out, or start having a panic attack, and then pass out. I can\'t even think about doing anything until I\'ve finished pooping for the day, which usually isn\'t till at least noon, and given it\'s dark by 5pm and takes 2 hours round trip to get the fuck out of this city, it is very rare that I can find anyone else to come with me and act as my backup.I have days where things aren\'t horrible. I can get up, hack on my truck, maybe do a bit of work in the yard, etc. I have days where I have 7 naps in between panic attacks. On an average day, I have about an hour or so where I can do very light physical work.I can\'t plan anything more than 20 minutes in advance because I just can\'t predict my health that far ahead. I try to get out camping at least once a year, but it\'s usually horrible. Essentially, I generally have an hour or two a day where I can be functional at all. The rest of the day is a mix of naps, showers (they seem to fix panic episodes?), lying around head-booping my cats.Throughout 2014-2017 was fucking terrible. I don\'t think I had a good or okay day in that time. This past 8 or 9 months has been sorta exceptionally decent, where I haven\'t had any severe symptoms last longer than a few days at a time.Every few years I\'ll wake up and feel ""normal"". Like, nothing hurts, I don\'t feel like I need to poop 8x before noon, but not pooping 8x before noon doesn\'t result in cognitive problems. On these days, it\'s like nothing bad ever happened. I can quite literally, run a marathon on those days and feel completely fine. I might even be fine for another 2-3 days. Then I\'ll wake up dead and it\'s back to my regular ""norm"".I smoke a pack a day and hate it, but I\'m terrified to quit again, as without exception, every time I quit, the longer I stay quit, the worse all symptoms get, to the point I end up in the ER every day until I start smoking again. It\'s not just a few weeks of withdrawl. I\'ve quit for years at a time, and those years were by far the worst. I\'m mostly hoping I\'ve got some interesting SNP\'s that make me less likely to die from lung cancer. I figure at this point though, I\'d much rather die of lung cancer a month from now, than live with the symptoms I\'d have for that month without smoking. I\'ve spent years debating with myself about whether or not this is valid.\n\nI don\'t look sick. At all. People almost always assume I am in excellent physical condition and even my few friends have a hard time believing my health is as bad as it is. I should\'ve got fat, or skinnier, or paler, or something. I look like a very healthy early 30\'s guy who\'s taken very good care of himself, eats well, exercises regularly, lives an  active life. If I trim the wizard beard down to less absurd levels of wizardry, I\'m mistaken for mid-late 20\'s. I fear if I shaved the beard entirely, I\'d be mistaken for an infant. I just don\'t look the part.\n\nIn terms of energy, some examples:\n\n* I can, on an okay day, do 40 or so chin ups, as long as my joints don\'t fuck off. On a bad day I can easily do 3 or 4, but then power out completely and start shaking.\n* I used to be an expert climber, and could stick to an overhang all day easily. Realistically now, I can easily climb like a gecko for about 10 or 20 seconds before my hands just stop ""doing"", and/or I start shaking violently. Again, on an exceptional day where I feel normal, I regard the same climb as something that an infant could do. I could climb it all day without using my feet.\n* Just walking around my truck, trying to solve some problem, I\'ll just start shaking and get weak. Feels like hypoglycemia, but blood glucose is never dangerously low. If I try to push through, I\'ll just progressively black out until i\'m unconscious.\n* I honestly know several people over the age of 90, who are substantially more active than I can be on an average day. I see fat white soccer moms out for a power walk with their expensive power walking suits and all their high tech power walking gear, and I no longer feel any distain. Just jealously. Fat soccer moms are in better condition than I am. Honestly, I don\'t think a lot of 90 yo\'s are less active than I am.\n\n**Stuff I can pretty definitively say is true but don\'t like to draw causation from correlation for reasons which will be apparent:**\n\n* The throat constriction almost always goes away on higher doses of dessicated thyroid, or at least is much more pronounced when I\'m off it, or on lower doses.\n* The longer and more wizardly my beard, the worse I feel on average. Eyup, and that there is why we don\'t conflate correlation with causation...\n* My ability to eat most foods is hit and miss. I definitely experience obvious allergic reactions to many foods one day, but can be fine with them the next. Raw foods are MUCH more allergenic. I eat only food that has been thoroughly cooked to absolute death, and then deep fry it for good measure. Any hint of nutrition remaining in my food will cause me to have an allergic reaction to it. The only known exception is blueberries and meat.\n* Major crashes are preceded by an increase in severity of GI issues. There are some clear links between the various GI symptoms and resulting cognitive affects a few hours or days later. There is a link here but I don\'t know what it is. Whether or not it\'s a causal link, I don\'t know. I just know damned well that my brain will shut down shortly after certain gut problems.\n* Crashes occur far more frequently during seasonal changes, and fairly confident they occur far more often a day or so before it starts raining. (SAD is sad?)\n* On paper, I have no known pathogenic parasites, bacteria, or viruses.\n* Adrenaline (or something which occurs normally when adrenaline would be released) is horrible for me. I used to LOVE the rush of having a moose charge me, or a bear charge at me, or a pack of wolves charge at me (#farmlife), but since onset of the disease, I just shake violently, get super weak, and just generally hate adrenaline (or whatever happens). It\'s to the point where the actual POINT of most of the things I enjoyed doing, now just ruins my day. Even stuff that doesn\'t scare me in the least, like I\'m out wheeling (4x4 crawling) and climbing a bit ledge, the truck flops sideways a little, and I KNOW it\'s okay and I know nothing bad will happen, but my whole body\'s like ""neeeooope"" and starts shaking. Same with biking (when I can). Not a chance of doing a small jump anymore.\n* Marijuana. I never enjoyed it when I was younger. Same reason as alcohol. I just didn\'t like not being in total control of myself. A few years ago, given I know I\'ve got a bunch of inflammatory stuff going on, I decided to give it another serious try. Took a tiiiny little hoot and was absolutely wrecked baked in about 30 seconds. Feel like I\'m flying mach 9 feet first while spinning around, then about a minute or two later, my entire body gets incredibly itchy (on the inside of everything. I can feel my kidneys itch). Then I have a nap because I get super tired and also just want it to be over. Tried building up a tolerance over a few months and got to the point where I could deal with a small toke every few hours, but it was always horrible. Tried again last year and the itching was much worse, so I got paranoid about Anaphylaxis and gave up. Everyone around me smokes pot constantly (BC lower mainland, no one doesn\'t smoke pot). A few months ago the same itching I get from pot, hit me again for no apparent reason. It feels like all of my skin is simultaneously itchy and completely numb. Like I\'ve lost a majority of my tactile feedback.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things which preceeded the initial onset:**\n\n(By initial onset, I\'m generally referring to the first big crash, which took place about a year after I noticed the throat constriction)\n\n* Started weight training about 8 months prior. Gained from 170 to 205lbs in that time.\n* Started dating a girl who had pretty aggressive HSV1. This may have been my first exposure to it. She was in incredibly good health at all times, but still had regular flare ups. Was taking valacyclovir to keep it under control. Always thought it odd that she was in such good physical condition, but had flare ups.\n* Recently went to a dentist because a wisdom tooth finally exploded. I pulled out most of the first one myself as it\'d fallen apart pretty good, and I apparently got all of it, but the second one broke and a few pieces required a dentist. Dentist incidentally, ""accidentally"" while he was working on me, and drilled into the side of my jaw. He said ""whoops!"" and continued on. I didn\'t notice what\'d happened until I checked it out in the mirror the next day, and connected the extra hole to the ""whoops"". This was the first time I\'d been to a dentist in a decade or more.\n* I\'d gone from hard shitty manual labour, to desk work about a year or so prior to the first major crash. The initial throat constriction actually started earlier though, when I first took a desk job at IBM.\n* I finally grew a proper beard :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo...

Never had sciatica or any kind of musculoskeletal issues ever. I was run over by a truck at 35mph with only a crack in a radial joint plus cuts and bruises. \n\nBut over Christmas I was in agony. I could not actually walk nor sleep. Lower back pain and a shooting pain down one leg. Basically spent several days in bed and probably 2 or 3 weeks not able to get out the house. I maxed out on codeine and other pain killers but they just weren't strong enough. \n\nAfter about a month the problem slowly dissipated. I've been to the gym, lifted large weights, been gardening, mountaineering and more since with zero issues.\n\nI'm at a loss as to how this happened and fearful it might return. The only thing I can think of is that I caught COVID for the first time before the back issue started. During that time it felt like my bones throughout my body were aching from the inside. A weird feeling. I'm now wondering if there was a link. Nerve inflammation as an after effect?\n\nMore importantly than the above I'm praying for everyone here on this sub because I just can't imagine what it is like to have ongoing sciatica rather than what I hope was just a brief spell for me, which I felt was unbearable.\n\n"""

NSAID problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/bw1aps/tramadol_while_bipolar/,b'Tramadol while bipolar?',,"b'I have bipolar 1 and am medicated for it. Ive been doing very well especially in the last few months. I also have lupus. This is a relatively new diagnosis. I cannot take Tylenol due to liver damage and cannot take NSAIDs due to genetic mutations and interactions with bipolar medication. I tried prednisone for my pain a few weeks ago. I asked my rheumatologist if it was safe for me to take prednisone with bipolar and be assured me it was, but it indeed was not. I had mild psychosis after a few days of it so I stopped it. At my visit last week he prescribed me Tramadol. I asked him again if this was okay to take with bipolar, he assured me it was, but when I look it up online it says it acts on serotonin receptors and can cause mania. I know through genetic testing and personal experience that any serotonin-affecting medications really throw me off emotionally. Ive been taking it for a few days now and am responding really well to it, but Im afraid one day Ill just snap and be manic or psychotic. Im losing hope that all my problems will ever be fully managed. I dont want to keep taking the Tramadol if its going to negatively affect my psychology (not taking about addiction) but I am hesitant to try a different opiate with less serotonin activity (because of addiction potential). Ideally I was hoping I would be prescribed gabapentin for my pain because then I could possibly wean off my Xanax, since gabapentin treats anxiety as well as pain. What should I do?'"

I've tried everything; you people are my last hope.""",,"b'Hello fellow sufferers, this season has been the absolute worst for me segn a delayed Spring, thus everything is blooming at once. I have perennial allergies as well so this time of year is double trouble. I went to a couple of stores and got myself a Nettypot and Steam sinus reliever. I already own allergy pills (Xyzal), allergy eye drops, anti-histamine nose spray, and Breath Right strips. I currently take allergy shots but it has only been a year and  4 months on maintenance so they shouldn\'t have any effect yet, as my doctor said. I also am taking melatonin this time of year due to horrible sleep quality.\n\nThe point is, I did EVERYTHING yesterday. Yes, the steam, the netty, pills, spray... etc. And and AND: it DIDN\'T WORK???? Like I layed in my bed and after 5 minutes all the sinus and nose congestion was back!! I was expecting something like this but not this bad! I have already come to the realization that allergy pills and nose spray are placeboes haha ( I know your secrets Big Med :\\] ), but I really didn\'t think that none of this would work at all! At least the netty pot got a lot of clear snot out (I guess this means it\'s from the sinuses?), even if it was to return not 5 minutes later.\n\nAt 2 in the morning, nose stuffed to high heaven, I was led to this subreddit. I needed help. I found lots of advice that suggested **prevention** as the best method of relieving allergies, the logic being, that if there isn\'t any allergen, there isn\'t any reaction. Ok great, but the real problem is, how would I go about doing this? I\'ll pretty much do anything at this point, as this is my last line of hope.\n\nEverything would be dandy if I just had one or two allergies, as a certain Koopa once said, ""It would be so awesome, it would be so cool."" This is not the case for me. I am pretty much allergic to everything under the sun (and under the roof) at this point. Local trees, all grasses, pollen, horses, dust, mold, pretty much everything non-food except dogs and cats, which is a real fluke. If I had the list from the doctor it would be about 20/30 of the allergens they tested me for that came out positive.\n\nSo with all these allergies, how would I escape even some of them? What do I need to do to survive this Spring without developing sleep apnea? Are there any articles or videos I should look at, that will help me ward off allergens? Thanks for any help! Also thanks for coming to my Ted-Talk!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.: To clear up any confusion, I am a teenager, thus I face big problems mouthbreathing; underdeveloped chin, bad sleep quality, chronic drowsiness... If I could live without these problems that would be very nice. Also the reason I am not taking corticosteroids, sino anti-histamine nose spray, is because I don\'t want my growth to be stunted, which is a generally accepted side affect for those medications.\n\nP.S.S.: I think it\'s so funny that I spent more effort on this than any essay I ever wrote in English class.'"
Advil problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/o3lvhs/tried_everything_still_cant_find_help/,"b""Tried everything, still can't find help""",,"b'Not really sure where to begin. This is my attempt to be brief in hopes of starting a conversation. I started writing a journal about a six weeks ago. I think it\'s been helpful to write, it\'s as if I finally get to share my experiences, even though no one is listening to them. I  started writing it in what was likely a manic state, which made it easier to write. My thoughts were more fluid and easier to express. Although, I\'m medicated now so mania isn\'t as intense, for better or worse I\'m not sure. For the past couple weeks, I\'ve been in some sort of state fluctuating between manic and depressed on a daily, sometimes hourly basis. I was only recently diagnosed bipolar about 3 months ago, at 34 years old. Although, my thought is that I\'ve probably been bipolar since I was about 24, when I began having problems with insomnia. Previous to that I was depressed for most of my life. \n\nThe diagnoses came after I had the most severe manic state of my life, which lasted about two months. I was hiking in the rocky mountains, often naked, often alone, sometimes in the middle of the night. My feet had deep cuts on them, but I didn\'t care, I felt like an animal, and that\'s how I wanted to live. I slept maybe 1-3 hours per night but had more energy than I\'d ever had in my life. I felt higher than any drug could ever make me. I became physically stronger and healthier than I\'d ever been in my life. I ate almost only fresh meat and vegetables, and did strenuous physical activity all day every day. I was also able to drink copious amounts of whiskey and beer, and smoke weed and cigarettes all day without tiring.  I was able to speak clearly and maintain conversations with people, for what felt like the first time in my life. People loved me. Many of the things I experienced in this state could only be described as magic. I was able to fix physical problems with my mind, I was able to attract and play with what most people consider dangerous wild animals (bears, wolves, owls etc,) I was able to read peoples minds, I made more money trading financial markets in those 2 months than I\'ve made in 4 years of trading. This is why I prefer to call the disease Magic-Melancholy now. It sounds nicer than manic-depression or bipolar disorder, and makes me feel less crazy.    \n\n\nI then became severely depressed and suicidal and, after about 6 months tried seeking professional help. \n\nThroughout the past 8 years, I\'ve tried talking to counsellors, psychotherapists, psychiatrists, general practitioners. None have been very helpful. I had one psychologist in 2017 who was great, but she eventually wanted to start a romantic relationship with me, and that revelation ended our relationship. The drugs I\'ve been prescribed throughout the years have been helpful at times, but never consistently. The main problem I have is insomnia. If I sleep well I\'m feeling good. Most recently when I tried looking for professional help, I saw a counsellor who was, despite her best intentions, useless. Reiterating the text book on mental health isn\'t going to help me. I\'ve already read it a thousand times in a thousand different formats. I also found a shrink which took about a month to get an appointment with and he spent 10 mins on the phone with me and diagnosed bipolar, and prescribed some drugs. The drugs he prescribed didn\'t work. I got another appointment two months later and he prescribed different drugs. They didn\'t work very well but helped a little. I asked for valium but he wouldn\'t prescribe it.\n\nNo one I\'m close with has accepted that I have this disease. Everyone thinks the problems I have are experienced by everyone, ""everyone has mood changes,"" or ""just get a normal job."" etc. I have no one I can talk to about this. My family is all physically separated and emotionally distant from each other.  I suppose I\'m really good at pretending I\'m ok, and just withdraw when I can no longer pretend. Traditionally, I\'m the one who takes care of others. \n\nI then decided to move from Canada to Mexico 2 months ago, against doctors advice, and against government Covid rules. It was difficult to do as travel was banned to Mexico at the time, but I found a way. I was desperate for something to change, or I was going to finish myself off.   \n\n\nI felt really good here for the first month, but now I\'m struggling again some days. I\'m able to get whatever drugs I want here so I\'ve been experimenting a little. If I sleep well I have good days. I\'m taking 50mg Seroquel before bed and 400mg Advil because the Seroquel causes me severe back pain. It puts me to sleep however, but I still wake up in the night. So when I wake up, I take another 50mg Seroquel and 400mg Advil, along with 10mg Valium. My doctors in Canada wouldn\'t prescribe valium but it\'s actually been the best drug for me. It puts me back to sleep most days and I wake feeling rested. It\'s the most sleep I\'ve had in many years. At least I\'m able to have some good days, and I never reach extreme mania or depression anymore. In this sense I\'m doing better than I have been for a very long time. It\'s still hard though because I have no one to talk to. The depressions still exist. There\'s so many things I\'d love to discuss.   \n\n\nI\'m going to try to meditate on a daily basis. I\'ve tried this before but haven\'t been able to maintain consistency, thus never able to get the desired effects of meditation. \n\nAnyways, don\'t wanna ramble on too much. If anyone wants to chat, drop a comment. It would mean the world to me to be able to have conversations about this.'"

NSAID constipation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/nqubix/my_sciatica_journey_long_read/,b'My Sciatica Journey (Long Read)',,"b'Hey everyone! \n\nYesterday, I posted a picture of myself before I went through my microdiscectomy. The location of my surgery was at the L5-S1 level. I had been experiencing severe sciatica for about a year at that point. My back pain was minimal but since Im a college student, the sciatica was horribly impacting my ability to function on a day-to-day basis. During presentations in class, I would look squirmish trying to relieve the intense pain going down my left leg. Walking to class was also difficult and during social events, I would always be questioned by my friends as to why I would go lie down in bed. Eventually, I got coined the nickname old man for having back issues at the age of 20 (I thought this was actually a humorous). Because I know many individuals are going through intense sciatic pain and are also considering surgery, Im going to give you guys the outline of what I experienced over the past year. Warning for all of you that hate long reads, this is a long read! I have divided my journey up into months/significant events so skip ahead if youd like. If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask! Hopefully, this is informative for everyone and can give yall some insight! \n\nEarly May 2020 \n\nI used to be a pretty active guy. I would go on runs on trails about 3-4 times a week and run about 3 miles during these runs. After a run one day, I noted something weird in my left lower leg that I would describe as dull, achy pain. I didnt think too much of it since I just figured my muscles were acting up. Finished the day walking my 3 miles instead of running them. \n\nMid May 2020 \n\nThis is when I knew something was definitely wrong. I woke up one day from bed and couldnt bend over. My back pain ranged from a 9/10 to a 10/10. The pain would be relieved by lying down or when I would sit in a chair. \n\nLate May 2020 \n\nAt this point, I figured I had pulled a tendon or a muscle in my back. The pain in my back was slowly starting to get better but I noticed that when I tried to walk, there was more pain down my left leg. This was accompanied by feeling numbness and tingling down in my feet. I decided to wait it off and see if it would resolve on its own. \n\nLate June 2020 \n\nBy the end of June 2020, my severe back pain had almost completely gone away. I experienced some back pain when I would try to bend over but nothing severe like I had previously experienced. On the other hand, my leg pain seemed to be getting worse. I decided to take a visit to my primary care physician to see what was up. After doing research online, I began to suspect that what I was experiencing was far worse than a simple muscle strain or pull. My dad had a herniated disc in his 50 and suffered from sciatica. My mom also had back pain and sciatica but to a lesser degree. It became clearer that this might be what I was suffering from. \n\nFirst Doctors Visit Late June 2020 \n\nSince my leg pain was still severe and walking/running was almost unbearable, I went into the doctors office to try and get a proper diagnosis. After explaining to my doctor I believed that I had sciatica and had a family history of having bad backs/sciatica, I was ordered to get X-Rays and was prescribed a steroid pack along with a NSAID. \n\nMy X-Rays came back completely normal, revealing that my problem did not originate from issues with my bones. While the NSAID I was prescribed did nothing to help my leg pain, I found that the steroid pack helped a lot. Even though it made me feel lethargic throughout the day, it definitely helped to get rid of the shooting pains going down my leg. Despite the relief, I could feel something was still wrong with the leg/back. \n\nBesides taking medications to help alleviate my symptoms, I decided that sitting in bed all day waiting for my pain to go away was not going to help especially if my injury was what I suspected- a herniated disc pressing against a nerve. I took the initiative to walk as much as possible throughout the day since I wasnt doing much apart form a small-time commitment internship. \n\nLate June- Late July 2020 \n\nAt first, I approached exercise a bit too rough. I tried to run through the pain but realized that really aggravated my symptoms. I quickly switched to walking. Progress was very slow. Each week I would walk more and more until I was walking about 4-5 miles every day. The more I walked, the longer it took for sciatica symptoms to really make walking unbearable. \n\nWhen I was getting in form and feeling better, I decided to do a mix of both running and walking. At first, I would walk 2 miles, then run 1, then Id return back to walking. Three very interesting things I noticed during this phase. First, walking downhill was a lot more painful than walking uphill, likely because when youre walking downhill, there is more force pushing on the disc toward the nerve. Second, I realized that I could reset my pain by either crouching or finding a place to sit down for a few minutes. After I would crouch or sit, my pain would go away. Throughout my walks, I would do this when the pain got really bad. My final observation was that especially after doing long distances, the next day my leg would feel a lot worse. However, after a few days, I would let my leg calm down and the next time I would go to exercise, I would be able to run and walk further without severe symptoms. \n\nAt this point, I was still hopeful that I would be able to make a full recovery without doing more intensive or intrusive treatments. Exercising was an excellent way to manage my pain in a natural way. \n\nEarly August \n\nWith my exercise process providing my relief, I was excited to continue it and get as close to normal as possible. I was near normal by the end of July or at least I thought I was until I had to move out of the room I was living in and move into my new apartment. Unfortunately, this was huge mistake. I moved out by myself and was bent over most of the time picking up things off the floor and carrying heavier objects like my mini fridge. \n\nAn hour or two after moving into my new apartment, my back and leg pain went back to very severe. I was a bit pissed at myself because I knew that all of the progress I had made went out of the window. \n\nMid-August 2020 \n\nAfter making the poor decision of moving into my apartment by myself, I was in absolute agony and pain for the entire month of August. My pain was at its worst. Because orientation was starting up at my school for first year students and I was orientation leader, I was unable to try to exercise my pain back to a stable level. When I did walk to places around campus, my leg pain was so severe I felt nauseous at times.\n\nOne afternoon, after walking around campus for a bit, my pain was the worst it had ever been. It got so bad, I was certain that I wasnt going to be able to fall asleep. I made the decision to go to the ER that night to see if they could provide any relief. \n\nER Visit Late August \n\nYou would think that going to the emergency room because youre in so much pain would be the logical move. Apart from the huge amounts of pain in my leg, I was starting to feel shooting pain in my left groin area and it felt strange to pee. I was afraid I was experiencing Cauda Equina. Unfortunately, the doctors did absolutely nothing during my stay there to improve my state of pain. I was ordered a CT-scan by the doctor and also checked for abscesses in the area since I did have a previous history of suffering from abscesses in the upper buttock area. \n\nAfter waiting on my CT-scan results, the nurse came back and told me I had what appeared to be a bulging disc at L5-S1. Otherwise, all of my other blood work came back normal. What angered me the most was that when the doctor came to talk to me, the doctor said all my tests came completely normal. I asked about the CT-scan which the nurse had explained to me had found a bulging disc. The doctor said he had not seen that on my report which left me so confused. The doctor explained that there was nothing wrong with me and that I would be going back home. When the nurse came back to my room I told her what the doctor had said. Her reply was absolutely unacceptable- Sometimes he just doesnt listen. \n\nThe nurse was a bit more helpful in telling my next steps. While I was hoping to get an emergency MRI, she explained to me that I would need to go get one after my visit at the ER elsewhere. I imagine that the CT-scan cant pinpoint causes like an MRI scan does, which is why it was labeled as a bulging disc instead of a herniated one. Remember that the two are very different. Regardless, I left the ER feeling very disappointed and with no pain relief whatsoever. I wasnt even given steroids to help reduce nerve inflammation. \n\nSeptember 2020 \n\nWith school starting back up in a fall semester, I was extremely busy with my academics which caused me delay my appointment with a well-reviewed orthopedic doctor in my area by a few weeks. In addition to this, because classes dont require a lot of standing up, I wasnt miserable all of the time since I could sit down in chairs. (Big thing I realized here too- different chairs will cause more pain than others!).\nI finally went in to my appointment with an orthopedic doctor and explained to him my story of back issues/leg problems. At first, we did what my primary care doctor did. I was prescribed a steroid pack along with NSAIDs and muscle relaxers. My steroid pack worked once again but left me feeling extremely tired throughout the days. NSAIDs once again provided no relief whatsoever. Muscle relaxers also gave me no relief from sciatica but helped me fall asleep on days when the pain was pretty bad. They also left me feeling yucky the day after. \n\nMy second visit with this new doctor was when I was actually able to get a diagnosis. Straight leg test was positive on the left leg during his examination in both visits. He ordered an MRI and recommended I start PT to see if conservative treatment would help. \n\nPT and MRI Early October 2020 \n\nA lot of people had said PT had given them mixed results. The success stories I read gave me hope that I would be feeling a lot better after PT. Unfortunately, I can say for sure that PT did little to nothing to help improve my pain. I ended up going three times in November and had no success after a variety of different exercises (Cobra pose seemed to trigger my symptoms more). \n\nWhen my MRI report came back I felt validated when I looked at the images. There was a clear herniation at the L5-S1 level that looked pretty gnarly. After dealing with the issue for a few months, I was finally able to say that my issues stemmed from a disc herniation that was compressing the existing left nerve root at the L5-S1 level. All of my other discs looked good. \n\nDoctor Follow-Up Late October 2020 \n\nEven the doctor was a bit surprised that I was experiencing a disc herniation at such an early age. I was glad that at this point, we had come to the cause of all of my leg issues. After I explained to him that PT had essentially failed, our next step was to go to epidural injections. \n\nFirst Injection Late November 2020 \n\nMy first injection went excellent. After seeing this new doctor, I was a bit worried since he had pretty lousy reviews online. Despite this, after going through with the first one, I experienced solid relief from my sciatic pain. This was however did not last long. After one month, my leg issues came back; certainly not as strong as they were in August, but still strong enough to where I wasnt comfortable standing up or walking for long distances. \n\nSecond Injection Early March 2021 /Follow-up After \n\nI had to wait three months before I could get another injection after my first. I went in with the same doctor excited that I would get similar relief like the first one gave me. The second did not go as planned. Instead of providing relief, I experienced steroid flush for about two days and that was it. I was extremely disappointed.\nIn my follow-up I told my doctor that the injection provided little to no relief. At this point, given that my symptoms had gone on for nearly a year, he sent me to a surgeon to discuss possible options with him. \n\nSurgeon Consultation May 2021 \n\nAfter explaining to my third new doctor that my symptoms had not improved, he told me that surgery would be the next option. With this he explained that at my young age, more surgeries were likely in the future. I decided to go through with it, because in all honesty, Id rather have ten more years of a pain-free lifestyle and have an awesome time during my 20s rather than be the guy who always has to stay in bed or sit down because of a disc herniation. \n\nSurgery June 1st 2021 \n\nWith that, that brings us to yesterday when my surgery was scheduled! Everything was painless and the care I received was exceptional. One minute I was feeling calm from sedation medicine and the next minute I woke up in recovery! I have not felt any leg pain so far. The only worry I have currently is that I cannot support my entire weight on my tippy toes on my left foot, but I suspect that this will slowly improve as time passes! Currently prescribed with narcotics, nausea medicine, anti-constipation medicine, and Narcan in case I overdose lol. Back feels pretty achy and sore but completely expected! \n\nEnding Note \n\nHopefully, this was informative even if it was a bit long. Let me know if anyone has any questions about any point in my journey and Ill be happy to answer them. A lot of people fear surgery but going in, I felt is was my best option given my experiences. Ill conclude by saying that many people do warn others against it and sure, it isnt for everyone, but it is certainly better than living a miserable lifestyle where you cant do much! For all sciatica sufferers out there, it can be mentally draining to have to deal it every day but remember to stay persistent and hopeful that things will get better. Keeping your mental health in a good state is just crucial in my opinion to have a faster and more effective recovery!\n\n\nThank you all for letting me share my story!'"

He was a really nice guy, but every time I saw him I would break out in head to toe hives and my eyes would become very very itchy. I tried undergoing regular allergy testing as well as a contact dermatitis test to see if I was allergic any metals or anything like that. Everything came back clean as a whistle. But every time I saw him I would still be breaking out and head to toe hives. I do have a cat allergy, as well as very bad seasonal allergies. But, this didnt have anything to do with that (or so I think, he didnt have a cat and he wasnt giving me flowers or anything like that). \n\nFast-forward to know, I went on a first date with another person. And sure enough 24 hours afterward I start breaking on head to toe hives. At this point, Im starting to get very very frustrated. Has this sort of contact dermatitis happened to anyone before? Ive been using a prescription strength corticosteroid, and that helps with some of the itching, but Im really starting to get frustrated and Im kind of at a loss as to where to turn right now.\n\nI can make another appointment to my allergist, but at this point Im almost thinking about undergoing a second opinion about whats going on.'"

acetaminophen problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/w6eqm6/advice_for_prolonged_pain_management/,b'Advice for Prolonged Pain Management',,"b'Hey, everyone. \nIm posting here as a last resort because experiencing sciatica is new for me and I havent had these problems in the past. I understand that theres no quick fix for things like this, but after seeking help on my own for a while, I figured Id ask to see if anyone could offer any insight to whether or not I should seek another professional opinion. \n\nMy pain began about three months ago; late April. It started out feeling like a pinched nerve or a pulled muscle, which Im no stranger to. Ive had pulled muscles in the past and theyve always resolved themselves within a couple weeks, but I realized this is much different. \nMy hips are misaligned and I have a bulging area in what my doctor refers to as the sacrum/sacroiliac joint which from what I understand is connected to the pelvic bone. Hes convinced that hard bulge being very obviously out of place is predominantly a muscular issue. Hes an OMT and definitely seems to know what hes talking about when it comes to his understanding of how those areas function, but he doesnt have any sense of urgency about my sacroiliac joint being misaligned. Hes already realigned my hips twicethe second time being yesterday. The first time it was done, I experienced relief for a solid two weeks and thought I was on the upswing, but was harshly disappointed when my pain reappeared a couple weeks ago. I dont want this to continue as a cycle of getting alignments/OMT therapy only for the issue to persist. I do a series of exercises that Im sure everyone here is familiar with; a huge packet of movements that do relieve pain sometimes, but other times do absolutely nothing for me. \n\nSleeping is an absolute nightmare, and I currently take ibuprofen and acetaminophen to combat the pain. I work a retail job that is thankfully very understanding of my limitations, but being in constant pain has been killing my spirit and I dont know what else to do. Its terrible when pain isnt treated with urgency, and I have a wealth of empathy for everyone here. \nShould I seek a second opinion? I really didnt want to turn to a chiropractor, but Ill admit the idea is looking better by the day. The doctors flatly refuse to do any sort of imaging, too, which is very frustrating'"
codeine side effect,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/11jgyv8/sciatica_2020_now/,b'Sciatica 2020 > now',Image437,"b'I (35 M) am currently really suffering with a flare up of sciatica. I hope by sharing my story I might get some support and advice from fellow sufferers.\n\nI am very active person: football, running, walking. I was out hillwalking in 2020 when I overstretched crossing a burn. I thought Id pulled my hamstring at first, as the pain increased (despite rest) over the next few weeks, I then wondered if the hamstring was torn. Being a somewhat typical man, I hadnt sought medical advice yet\n\nI had to get advice when the pain just became unbearable over the course of another few weeks. I was then prescribed the strongest co-codamol and these helped greatly. I also got referred to physio but decided to take workplace physio as it would be much quicker to get an appointment. I didnt find this very helpful as it was telephone consultations due to the Covid lockdown. I ended up getting a face-to-face consultation with another physio through a football contact and he was fantastic. I was given exercises to strengthen around my glutes, hamstring, hips. These all worked and although progress was slow, I was getting better.\n\nThe physio believed I had some kind of pinch in my nerve due to the way my muscles developed through years of playing sports. I am going to be asking for a general review of this opinion shortly.\n\nBy autumn 2021 I was back playing football and running again.\n\nFast forward to Christmas 2022, out of nowhere, with nothing I can pinpoint, or any warning signs, it came back with a vengeance. Initially, it was manageable, I immediately got referred back to physio. I had a couple of sessions, got a new exercise / stretching regime, some of which Id kept up from 2020 anyway. I even have the same resistance band Id been regularly using from that time for my glute exercises. Recovery seemed to be going well.\n\nHowever, on Tuesday last week, I was walking down the stairs at home and just felt a blinding pain and spasm in my left leg. I had to phone my partner to come home from work early as I couldnt watch my little one safely. The pain was worse than ever, still seeming to emanate from my hamstring, but also in my buttocks, glutes, down my lower leg - the worst pain I have ever experienced. Non prescription pain relief just wasnt having any effect. I wasnt able to do any of my stretches at all either.\n\nIve been off work since and have been so reliant on my partner. I know I am very lucky in that regard. On Tuesday night, I barely slept, the pain just kept me awake and I absolutely took more painkillers than I should have.\n\nWednesday morning, the doctor prescribed Naproxen and strong co-codamol. I felt a difference, particularly during the day, but at night again I was awake at 1am and 5am. I tried sleeping on the couch, the bed, the spare bed, the floor! Pillows under me, between my legs, etc, etc. Lots of googling that night.\n\nThursday, I got a different doctor. He told me to park the cocodamol and try valium and amitriptyline instead. One tablet of amitriptyline didnt really seem to do anything but the valium certainly loosened me up both mentally and physically! It was better, but still not great and I am seeing 4/5am like clockwork every morning. I have also reintroduced cocodamol which the doctor told me I could do, but to be extremely mindful of this due to its interactions with the other medications. I feel fine and have had no side effects, which is a blessing.\n\nOther things I am doing when I can: very light stretching, trying to walk a little every so often, hot baths with salts, deep freeze, deep heat, bags of peas, compression band (joint waist and leg one). \n\nTonight, I am switching my Naproxen to before bed and also taking my amitriptyline then too instead of at 8pm. If I can sleep through the night I will be delighted. I will be phoning the GP at 8am and I have physio on Thursday too, so will be seeking professional advice then too.\n\nIt feels good to get this down in writing - cathartic! Apologies its so long.\n\nI wonder if anyone has experience of similar medications and trying to get their consumption times correct? Also other medication options? As both GPs have asked what I was thinking, and both times I was a bit unprepared for that question!?\n\nAny opinions on CBD based creams? I am not sure if that stuff is snake oil!\n\nAny other hints, tips, and suggestions gratefully received!\n\nThanks for reading\n\nUPDATE: \n\n- After one week of pretty much crippling pain, I woke up in a much better state and so far (4pm) my symptoms are suddenly much milder. Last night was the first night I slept through the night but 30mg of Amitriptyline and 60mg of codeine certainly would have helped that\nI have only taken my anti-inflammatory so far today as a result. I really dont like how the codeine makes me feel and know how dangerous it can be to take these for prolonged periods of time. I am going to walk to the shops shortly, and intend to have a hot bath with salts. I cant pinpoint exactly what might have changed, I have flung the kitchen sink at it, but I am going to keep it all up. I am under no illusions that it may return tomorrow, or next week, etc\nI will take codeine tonight and tomorrow (only one tablet) before bed, as I really cant handle lack of sleep and thats when its at its worst, but I intend (all going well) to take none Friday - Sunday and possibly even return to work on Monday.\nOne day at a time though, and I wont be phased by setbacks thanks to all your help, advice, and support!'"
NSAID problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/13b373c/mri_injection_options_or_surgey/,"b'MRI, Injection options or Surgey?'",Image301,"b'On Wednesday, April 5th, I woke up with hip pain extending through my leg that was constant and throbbing. I was able to walk with pain a on Thursday, April 6th.As the day progressed, the pain became unbearable to the point where I scheduled an appointment with my primary care provider for the same day. Upon meeting with my primary care provider, she requested an MRI and X-ray to be taken for my hip/leg and wrote a referral to see an orthopedic specialist. She also prescribed me painkillers, steroids (Prednisone), and muscle relaxants for my ailment. I started my medication that day, but the pain was constant through the night, waking me up every 15-20 minutes.   \n\n\nOn Tuesday, April 12th, I met with the orthopedic specialist who took additional X-rays. During this time the pain was still constant, so he prescribed me another NSAID. The orthopedic specialist was unable to accurately diagnose the problem as he assumes its a lumbar radiculopathy, so he referred me to a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation specialist. \n\nOn Friday April 14th, I met with the PM&R specialist and and she informed me it was in fact a lumbar radiculopathy and that I needed additional X-rays and MRI.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started PT the week after and most of the symptoms have alleviated, the pain is bearable unless I am prolonged standing.

For the most part I took 2 pills each night, usually with dinner, though I have to say I didn\'t really notice a difference whether or not I took it with a meal.\n\nAnother thing I\'ll mention in case it applies to you: I have steatocystoma multiplex. I inherited from my dad, and it\'s essentially hundreds of small bumps under my skinmostly chest and back. Feel free to skip this paragraph if you don\'t have these. They\'re actually sacs of sebum, but the only treatment right now is excision. I first thought I had familial inherited lipomatosis and as a result had multiple lipomas, but my derm diagnosed them as steatocystomas. I experienced an ""initial breakout"" (IB) but it was very gradual and lasted most of the course. For most people this acne/cystic IB is normal on Accutane, but since I have steatocystoma multiplex, it also seemed to trigger an steatocystoma IB! These new steatocystomas were much larger than usual, and one in particular was so large that I had to get my derm to inject steroids into it to reduce swelling a couple months ago. Right now it\'s actually slowly ejecting itself, which has never happened to any of my steatocystomas, so that\'s weird and kinda freaky lol. Time will tell whether this had any long term effect on my steatocystoma multiplex.\n\nMy experience:\n\n* **Dry lips, skin, eyes, hair**\n* **Constant exhaustion and fatigue**, so much that I\'d almost fall asleep between sets at the gym. I could sleep 10-12 hours a day and still feel tired. This combined with the dry eyes were honestly the worst side effects for me. Lips were actually fine for me because of Lanolinsee below for tips. But the EXHAUSTION! Get ready to be TIRED AF *all the time*.\n* Slightly thinner, sparser, and curlier hair. I used to get my hair thinned once or twice a year, but I don\'t think I\'ll ever need to do that again now that my hair is thinner & sparser (not sparse, just sparser).\n* Slight joint pain, mostly in the knees\n* Giant black boogers. Presumably dried blood. Gross. So much and so big that I had trouble breathing through my nose sometimes. Believe it or not I actually never picked my nose before these came into my life because I just really ever get boogers lol, and the small amount I did get I just got rid of them by blowing my nose.\n* One night I woke up a split second before a spontaneous nosebleed would ruin my sheets, but that was the one and only nosebleed I got from Accutane. See tips below for prevention.\n* On average I had to drink more water, otherwise my urine would be super dark yellow. Drinking more water didn\'t seem to have any other noticeable effects though. It\'s probably good for you in general, but it personally didn\'t alleviate exhaustion or dry lips/eyes/skin.\n* My skin, eyes, lips, and hair returned to normal after about 2-3 weeks at the end of my course. All are slightly drier than before my course, which means that my T-zone is still kind of oily, since I began with an *extremely* oily T-zone.\n* My night vision is slightly worse, and lights have a faint aura, especially at night. It\'s already better now and we\'ll see if this goes away with time but it\'s not a huge side effect for me. It could be much worse.\n* I\'m not sure if this is related but on average I had an easier time cleanly passing stool, otherwise known as the ghost poop, where you wipe and there\'s nothing there! Again, not sure if Accutane did this or if it was just a coincidence.\n* Personally I could go several days without showering because I never got dirty, sweaty, oily, or smelly. It was kind of weird lol. I used to shower every single day so that was a big change. After a while it got annoying to moisturize head to toe after every shower, so I\'d shower every other day or so.\n\nFinally, some tips:\n\n* **REMEMBER**: Everyone responds to Accutane differently.\n* **PACKAGING**: Avoid Myorisan because the packaging is impossible to deal with smh. Everyone complains about Accutane packaging but honestly just get Claravis and once you remove the foil containing the pills from all the packaging and it\'s actually super duper easy to get your pills \\\\_()_/ That\'s right, let me repeat: You can remove the pill foil from all the packaging. Tell your dermatologist to be explicit about the brand when sending the prescription to the pharmacy, and they\'ll usually do their best to fulfill the request.\n* **HAIRCARE**: **Stop using shampoo.** You don\'t need it. Accutane targets your sebaceous glands, and without sufficient oil they usually produce, your hair can fall out very easily. I experienced this last night (a month after I completed my course): I washed my hair with just a little bit of shampoo and every time I gently ran my hand through my hair, a couple of strands would fall out, and it just would not stopif this happens to you, stop running your hands through your hair, put a leave-in conditioner in, get out of the shower, and stop using shampoo henceforth. I cleanse my hair with conditioner every few days and put in a leave-in conditioner most days. Also, in case you\'re interested in hair color, I was able to bleach & dye my hair from black to blond (ashy blond balayage, about a 7 or 8) in one sitting but that might be because I have thick and strong hair, and I was super oily everywhere, including my scalp/hair, before starting Accutane. Be gentle with your hair and it will thank you. Washing and drying (towel or otherwise), be gentle!\n* **HOLY GRAIL ITEM #1**: **LANOLIN** nipple cream. This is the single most important item throughout my Accutane journey. If I had to pick ONE item that made the course bearable it would be **LANOLIN** nipple cream. Trust me, it\'s cheap and *one small tube* will last you almost your entire course. No matter *how* dry your lips, this will keep them super moist super long. I put it on overnight and it makes a world of difference. If I fall asleep and forget to put it on, I\'ll wake up with super chapped lips, to the point of cracking if I yawn. Even then, a minute or so after I apply it to super chapped lips, my lips magically healed. What makes Lanolin much better than any other product is that it integrates with your skin and seeps into it. Lip balm, vaseline, and Aquaphor all just sit on top of your lips. They work by creating a seal that keeps the moisture in, but it does nothing to increase the moisture. Aquaphor or lip balm will dry up and leave a nasty film on top of my lips that I constantly needed to wipe off. Lanolin never does that. It literally seeps into your lips and moisturizes from inside AND keeps the moisture in. It\'s also tasteless and odorless, and if you want that lip gloss look you get that for free. That\'s probably the only downside I can think of, that you might not want glossy lips. You should only use Dr. Dan\'s (hydrocortisone) sparingly, and definitely not in the long term, but honestly you shouldn\'t put steroid cream on your lips if you don\'t have to. I have both Dr. Dan\'s and lanolin, and lanolin actually healed about the same, if not better. You can even stick a little bit up your nose to prevent nosebleeds. It\'s safe for mom and baby since it\'s meant for sore nipples from breastfeeding, meaning you can literally eat it and be fine, which is comforting for something you\'re constantly putting on your lips. You only need a tiny, tiny, tiny bit each application, and that will last you probably until the next time you eat or drink something. There are some lip balms coming out that use lanolin because people are finally realizing what they\'re missing out on. I have a bunch of Aquaphor and lip balm lying around now because lanolin was just so much superior. Literally if I could give every Accutane user just ONE tip I would say **LANOLIN. LANOLIN. LANOLIN.**.\n* **HOLY GRAIL ITEM #2**: CeraVe moisturizing cream with pump. This is some heavy duty moisture and it\'s safe for sensitive skin! I used it head to toe, including face and basically every part of my entire body, even eyelids. It lasts all night, and the pump makes it super easy to dispensealso just feels better than having to open the tub and stick your fingers in all the time.\n* **HOLY GRAIL ITEM #3**: Systane/Refresh eye drops and/or gel drops. The drops are good for temporary eye dryness relief. The gel drops blur your vision for a little bit but the relief lasts a little longer. The gels that come in a tube (not gel drops) are thicker, harder to use, and are really only meant for bedtime.\n* **SUN**: Obviously, avoid the sun whenever possible, and wear sunscreen! One time I was at the park for the whole afternoon, and even though I liberally applied 3 layers of sunscreen, I still got sunburned. It\'s no joke. This is what my thigh looked like that day: https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/8o7uwd/my_thigh_after_a_few_hours_in_the_sun_today_i/\n* Do *not* take any tetracycline class of antibiotics (for example, doxycycline) while you\'re on Accutane. I got a few bacterial infections during my course and luckily there are several other classes of antibiotics you can use that are okay to take with Accutane.\n\nThat\'s it! Overall I\'m happy I decided to take it, at least so far. During my course my skin was insanely smoothto the point of shining like handsome Squidward. It\'s back to normal now but smoother than before the tane. We\'ll see if there are any adverse long-term side effects. Fingers crossed! Finally, I\'ll just leave you with, you guessed it, **LANOLIN SAVES LIPS** and my lips literally *never* bled because of lanolin. Godspeed.'"

To fix this I was prescribed hydrocortisone cream (a steroid cream) to use for a week. I did so and the problem was sorted and my eczema completely disappeared for the most part.\n\nHowever, around a year ago (August 2021) I noticed it coming back, with my eyes being by far the worst. I knew hydrocortisone had worked before so I bought myself some. It worked after using it for a week however eczema kept coming back. Against my better judgment and rather stupidly, I ended up using hydrocortisone cream on the area around my eyes on and off for around 8-9 months - basically enough time to become addicted and reliant on the cream.\n\nIt was near the end of April 2022 that I decided to stop using the cream completely. For around 2 months I weened myself off the cream, dealing with some pretty rough side effects of corticosteroid withdrawal (dry eyes, rough skin, swelling). I have been 100% steroid free since July (around 3 months) and I am mostly happy with my eyes. My eczema has gone and all the painful/really bad side effects are gone.\n\nHowever, now I am dealing with redness around my eyelids, sometimes mild swelling (which goes away after applying a cold cloth or dunking my face in cold water, etc.) and the skin is rather sensitive and sometimes dry. I acknowledge I have damaged the skin around my eyes and will have to deal with that for a while however some days it is almost unnoticeable so I know I can eventually recover fully.\n\nI currently use a range of soothing eye ointments (hydrosil dry eye gel is one that has been particularly helpful) that I carry with me however these only do so much. I also notice that a piroten or Benadryl can help with the appearance of the skin (don't know if that information helps but trying to paint a full picture).\n\nThis is not an urgent issue and is definitely livable as I am no longer reliant on the steroid cream and most days it is not that noticeable (I also wear glasses most of the time which helps appearance-wise) but it is something I would ideally like to move past. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks :)"""
anticonvulsant vomit,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11jp6lz/dismissed_by_psych_helpadvice/,b'Dismissed by psych Help/Advice?',,"b'This is probably going to be a longer post. I was diagnosed with bipolar in October, when I was seeking out a psychiatrist to put me back on meds for anxiety/depression as I had been diagnosed with those over two years ago by my pediatrician shortly before turning 18 hence why I couldnt contact my ped to put me back on those meds as I aged out of her care and didnt have/still dont have a primary physician. During my intake and explaining numerous things concerning my current and recent moods/mood history/diagnosis history/medication history, I was diagnosed as Bipolar 2 with anxiety and ADHD. I didnt want to believe it at first, however it is absolutely correct, especially after talking extensively with my dad where we both recognized the same kinds of patterns in mood history as him. I start treatment with trileptal and Zoloft which are working relatively solidly at managing the symptoms most effecting my quality of life (uncontrollable rage and just the intensity of the mood swings). I started retaking my hormonal birth control pill (was having unprotected sex, meds kinda helped me realize I should be at least taking some precaution to prevent pregnancy as I live in a red state) which is prescribed through the pill club to me, and requires you to update your medications. When I updated, I included the trileptal, which ultimately caused my account to be suspended due to the interaction between hormonal birth control and anticonvulsants. I brought this to my psych asking to switch my medication because I didnt want to endure a procedure such as the IUD (dont have the additional time or resources to afford this, plus pain). He put me on depakote, because he agreed there was an interaction between the trileptal and found none with depakote, which almost immediately caused hours of vomiting and general increase of suicidal thoughts. I called the office and they instructed me to stop taking said medication and to come in for a sooner appointment. When I went in, my psych (who is older than dirt and male), firstly, didnt even know I was off that medication, and secondly, thought I was on a different medication altogether. He then told me that I didnt have any other options than to abstain from sex if I wasnt gonna take care of my birth control situation. When i tried to ask about alternative treatments for bipolar, such as lithium, which he had mentioned was a treatment, he said he refused to prescribe me anything other than anticonvulsants because he didnt want to deal with any side effects I might bother him about. I began to raise my voice because I was at a loss at what to do, and he told me that I was too difficult to treat, the office manager came in as he could hear the back and forth (very tiny office, psychs office connects to office managers with a door). The office manager told me I had to leave if I was going to argue with the doctor, I asked my psych what else could be done and he said nothing and that I needed to leave since I refused to follow his treatment plan. So I left the office with no medication to treat my bipolar (no mood stabilizer or antidepressant) and was told I was being dismissed as a client. Additionally, I left a google review urging others to not receive care from here and explained my interaction with him that day, he replied to my review which is attached to my name and explained the interaction as he saw it. This confirmed the fact that I received treatment from him and specifically mentions that I refused to stop taking my birth control, as well as calling me vulgar, which I took pretty hard as I felt I was trying very hard to not let anything offensive/cursing come out so he couldnt just write me off as being crazy. I now have no access to any medication, which is immensely difficult for anyone plagued with this disorder, but has been especially hard as a completely financially independent college student with all my schooling funded by academic scholarships requiring me to be stable enough to merely survive but also maintain an above average GPA with no psychiatric accommodations as he cancelled the forms being faxed over to my colleges office of disability to get accommodations. I guess Im looking for both support and guidance about this entire situation. Was I genuinely rightfully dismissed? Is there anything I can do about the reply to the review I left other than taking it down? I just dont want others to make the same mistake of seeking treatment from someone who lacks basic empathy and understanding of bipolar patients.'"

The studies I have read always bring up the fact that there is a link between drug ""Abuse"" and ADD/ADHD.\n\nThe reason for the throwaway account is because I wanted to share my experience(which I do not recommend to anyone else) of how I ended up self medicating for years on Opioids(The Acetaminophen & Hydrocodone helped alleviate my anxiety and helped me focus). I only graduated H.S because of this and when I went on to college and stopped self medicating, I would fail. I did find a temporary solution which was music. It drowned out all the noise and l was able to focus on one thing. It didn\'t work for long and I ended up dropping out of college twice. Went for a third time and started self medicating again and my grades were greatly improved, however I did not like that I was depending on the pills that were meant to treat pain. I went to my family doctor and straight out told him that I was taking opioids to help me with school. His response shocked me ""Don\'t worry you are not an addict, you are just trying to help yourself."" \n\n*Most of what I could remember him telling me*\nMost people who go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed will end up self medicating and not abusing it like others. That the reason for the self medication is to seek a solution to the problem that they have in their normal life. Where others see drug abuse at first glance, in reality it is someone scared to seek help in fear of the consequences that may follow. We should not see this as a problem but as a symptom and act accordingly. In your situation I\'m not surprised you picked opioids as a solution since it works decently with your issues, but we need to get you on the right medication in order to fully treat you.\n*\n\nHe then recommended me his friend and I\'m now being fully treated on the right medication.\n\nHas anyone had experience with this type of thing before ?

We\'ve been eating Beyond Burgers for a couple years now, and we both like \'em.  This year, we started trying the Impossible Burger and burger meat to make things like meatballs. \n\nFirst Instance:\n\nFelt nauseous, had minor regurgitation, slept for three hours in the afternoon, b/c I felt terrible.\n\nSecond Instance:\n\nScarfed an impossible burger on a salad between meetings. One and a half hours later, had a bodily fire sale. Everything must go, out both ends. And it was awful. I told my husband several times throughout the two-hour ordeal that I was going to die. He was smart and kind and helpful. ""You\'ve just gotta get whatever it is out of you, you\'ll drink water, and sleep for a day. It\'s gonna be all right."" As he\'s washing my body and the shower. (I know. I got a good one.) (And I know, gross. Sorry. It\'s just what happened.)\n\nIn-Between\n\nI had chalked that last experience up to me not washing the lettuce well enough on the salad. I absolutely did not put the two instances together in my head. They were months apart.\n\nLast Night:\n\nHubby made pasta, impossible burger balls with cheese and sauce. Salad on the side. One and a half hours later, same as last time, but a little worse. After two and a half hours of vomiting and diarrhea, I had to finally lay down and literally will myself to stop. I was empty, there was no point in either. It took three hours of sleep and concentration to get it to stop. (I didn\'t want to go to ER for an IV, b/c expense and COVID.)\n\nOverall:\n\nI realized by my Googling that this particular subject of alternate meats is politicized. I think that\'s ridiculous. There\'s not enough beef to go around for all of us forever, and there\'s money for everyone. I am absolutely one hundred percent a beef lover. Steak is my favorite food. There is no agenda in this post, except to share with other people who are as scared as I was last night.

Maybe the mix of both set something off? Possible red herring. Also, worthy of note, this just happened to me. I don\'t know anyone else yet personally to whom this happened.

codeine itch,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/cnx12e/i_get_turned_on_by_injuringkilling_myself_long/,b'I get turned on by injuring/killing myself. Long post. Serious health issues now',,"b""Throwawy for obvious reasons and sorry for long post I have alot on my heart. I have a weird fethis and that is dying by liver/oran failure generally anything that injure me turn me on. I also get turned on by dying in medical seting. When I was 15 I started to imagine myself getting liver failure or organ failure and strangely getting turned on by it. This is important for later, but this fethis was just a phase.  This is extremly weird I know, but I have always known there is something very wrong with me. I have aspergers, but i think i have some underlying mental condition. I Love being being wreckless, I set fire to stuff and get into huge fist fights outnumbered often losing. I am 19 and estimate I have been in 40+ fights. I have even been stabbed with a bottle once. I feel euphoric when i do it. Often after fist fights I masturbate because of the pure euphoria. I feel mentally very ill at times because I get sexually turned on by the weirdest stuff. Since May 2018 I have ran oral steroids which I bough from my drug dealer and bying them from the internett. The reason for running them was because I wanted to get big and muscular, because I have serious body image issues also i binge eat alot so i didnt wanna get fat, the binge eating would make me big. I started to run ran 50mg dianabol everyday. After 5 months i started to feel sick every morning and i puked alot of my food up. I reckoned this was my liver acting up, but the fucked up thing is when i recognized this the memories from being fifteen started to come back and lets say i Felt turned on all the time.\n\n I ran the Dianabol for 1 month more before I stopped it. I later went on a 2 month drug binge where I did alot pills and cocaine. In december I decided to run Trenavar at 120mg stacked with epistane 50mg every day. For the sole intention of getting big for attention, and to try and kill myself with liver failure because at this point i am very depressed and I just wanna die. I drank alot of alcohol when i was running this stack mainly because i wanted to escape and to kill myself. I drank maybe a six pack 3 times a week. After about 2 months of abusing my body for no reason other than getting turned on I started to abuse OTC codein which has paracetamol in it. This is where it became to much for me. After a 8 day binge i started to get pain in my liver. I could actually feel my liver when walking and working out. I started to feel dizzy. I stopped drinking and halfed my steroid dose. I Started to feel better after about 1 weeks and i kept running my stack. \n\nThen one fatefull saturday i was invited to a party, I never get invited to parties, because everyone deems me weird. I had to go. When I was at the party I drank extremly heavly over 0.5 liters of vodka and snorted alot of cocaine. The next morning i had pain where my kidnes where and when i peed the pee was black. I was in dire pain . I started to regret what i had done with my body. I had pain in my kidnes and a weird tingling sensastion in my stomach for 2 weeks. I Wanted to kill myself in this time period but i couldn't go through with it. I still felt turned on by damaging my liver and organs, but i was still extremly worried that i might have permantly injured myself so i stopped all alcohol and steroids. I waited intuil july 2019 when i went back on trendione at 90mg everyday. I Did this because I didnt want to loose my size.  It went only 6 days before i started to shit blood. and after 10 days i had dire pain in my liver. I stopped everything. Its august now and i am starting my apprentice job soon, but i feel like i have a foot in the grave. I have serious pain in my liver and my stomach is bloated. I have indigisten and i itch everywhere, but i get turned on by this knowning that i am in dire shit. I wonder what is wrong with me why i keep killingmyself and why i cant get turned on by women or men, but by objects and injuring myself. I also cut myself. I am scared of going to the doctors because then i have to admit what i have done and they will know that i am a drug abuser. \n\nCan someone also talk to me. I am very lonley at the moment. I am also in alot of pain"""

Now I am in more pain due to this infection. The gum graft is not doing or healing like its supposed to. He finally this time gives me a medicinal mouth wash and tried to give me another form of penicillin which I am allergic to and causes vomiting.

Asthmatic, some allergies, insomnia (and this sure isn\'t helping).\n\nThe cartilage of my right ear hurts intermittently. For reference, I\'m using [this pain scale](https://cdn.paindoctor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pain-scales.png). \n\nThis is a stinging pain centered just above the meatus, which becomes sensitive to touch. There is a constant baseline pain which spikes momentarily (usually only a few seconds) by 1-2 points on the scale whenever the area is physically disturbed. There is no redness, swelling, heat to touch, or fever. This follows a fluctuating but similar pattern every time:  \n\n\n* Baseline pain starts at 0 and ramps up over time. This can last hours or days.\n* As the baseline increases, the area that can cause pain spikes increases. At its worst, eating and speaking causes pain spikes as the jaw muscles pull at the ear.\n* Baseline plateaus, usually around a 4, making sleep incredibly difficult but I can manage with most daily tasks. Sometimes goes up to a 5, rarely a 6. This can last for hours or days.\n* Baseline spikes, usually to 6 or 7. I\'ve had a few 8s and precisely two 9s where I could not move or speak until it passed. This is usually only for a few minutes, but has been upwards of an hour a couple of times.\n* The pain ""pops"" (on one 9 there was an audible click) and all pain and sensitivity to touch subsides within the next couple of minutes. All is well again.\n* No pain mitigation (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, codeine, heat, cold) has ever helped.  \n\n\nThis only happens with my right ear, has never happened with the left. There doesn\'t appear to be any pattern around its occurrence. I sleep primarily on my left side. This has been happening for decades, but it used to be infrequent (months between incidents), short (hours at max instead of days) and less painful (spiking at 4 instead of 9). Nowadays I can measure the time between incidents by weeks.\n\nI\'ve been to my GP\'s office. The intern suggested it was TMJ dysfunction and that I should ice my jaw and seek physiotherapy. Icing my jaw turned out to be unhelpful, and the nature of TMJ dysfunction doesn\'t seem to match with how the pain ""pops"" at the end.\n\nNo pics added as there\'s no visible difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic\n\nAny thoughts?'"

I didn't listen to the dealers advice and ended up having way more then I should have. It started off slow with little to know affect, so I kept having them, until it eventually hit me like a wall, and my heart started to race. I started to panic and tried to throw up, but it didn't help much. After that didn't work, I tried drinking a bunch of water, but my heart rate kept skyrocketing. Eventually I had someone drive me to the hospital, and my memory is kinda hazy after that. The hospital also said I had barbiturates in my system, but I believe that may be caused by the fact that I consumed kratom in the past. Surprisingly after this event I seemed fine, until the next time I had smoked. During this I convinced myself that I was having a heart attack and had a similar experience except without going to the hospital. I thought I was going to die. A few days later I had the same experience without smoking weed. After that I quit smoking weed, cigarettes, and, alcohol and caffeinated drinks. But, this didn't do much, but make the panic attacks worse and I started getting paranoid about my environment. For example I would have weird thought processes and was at a point where I was half convinced my mother was trying to poison me. \nDuring this month I also began to have massive amounts of heartburn and felt sick whenever I ate food. I believe this was caused by antibiotics I took for acne. It's been three months now and I had my heart checked by a cardiologist and the panic attacks have mostly gone away, but they are still triggered by certain things. Caffeine can cause it, I had a non-alcoholic beer and that caused me to start to panic. I want to be able to have a beer sometime in the future and maybe Coffee or iced tea, without having an adrenaline rush, from thinking my hearts about to fail.\n What should I do, I had no medical treatment for panic attacks earlier, because I was too young for the normal medication. Is there a chance that it is a heart problem? Could it be a brain injury, and if so when will it eventually heal?(thanks for reading, sorry if the formatting weird its my first post, I may post this elsewhere too)"""

I feel like I often don't deserve what I get, but I don't feel super smart. I feel like I can't accept even a routine scholarship because I don't feel worthy, even though my parents and everyone I know tells me that I am smart.\n\nI also have been keeping some things apart from my parents and family. I've never told them or hinted that I don't have faith in their god. They've never expressed any distrust of those who are like me, but I have zero clue how they would react and I'm totally dependent on them for my living. \n\nIn my mind, I regularly am thinking about the whole world and how people who are just like me live lives worse than my own and so I feel guilty for it when I know I'm not. I can't ignore it, and I feel like I can't help but tell others about these things, to the point where I neglect classes and dates. \n\nI have regularly stopped what I've doing for minutes at a time, up to an hour, just suddenly mentally paralyzed by thoughts I don't want to have, usually in the middle of the night. Sometimes it's about oblivion (the non religious view of it), sometimes it's about my family, sometimes it's about other things, but I try everything like trying to hug myself or the parent I live with if she's nearby, just to make it stop. \n\nI regularly stay up at night, with very random, wild, and convoluted sleep cycles.\n\nI have a lot of difficulty crying, even when I know that others would probably do so when I feel the way I do, and being unable to do so makes me doubt my own problems and understanding of whether I'm in a good situation or not.\n\nI regularly feel other effects, even being unable to take showers on a regular basis because the white surrounding me without a real difference from one centimetre to the next makes me feel dissociated from myself.\n\nI should also tell you that I have autism, high functioning autism.\n\nI don't drink much alcohol, maybe 65 grams of pure alcohol over a one month period, and I don't take any other drugs other than OTC NSAIDs for a wicked cough, nor any prescription drugs.\n\nI've had other problems like this in the past, like extreme aerophobia where the flight attendants literally had to drag me onto the plane with me holding a blanket at the really embarrassing age of weeks away from being 13, when a few days before I had a hallucination that Satan was next to my bed as I woke from a nightmare and I ran upstairs and slept there for days. For a year when I was 15, I was embroiled in an extremely painful existential crisis, mostly over faith but also how I was to grow older. I couldn't shower for weeks at a time because of the problem I mentioned before.\n\nI have been unable to explain how I feel to anyone in person. My doctor isn't stupid, but I don't feel like she's the doctor I chose, and because of the way my finances and difficulty with independent travel on the spot are, with bad public transport in a very low density suburb, I feel dependent on my parents for getting even basic medical care. \n\nThe one good thing is that I'm not suicidal, but I certainly don't feel happy about my life.

I'm a 22 female, I stand for about 8 hours at my current job and do a lot of moving around but minimal lifting and bending. Recently in the last year the pain has gotten unbearable, it started with my right knee starting to swell up and burn and I assumed it was an injury I got at work. Well, I took some time off work to get surgery on my eye, after about a month of resting my knee pain became bearable again and I didn't worry about it. I started a new job in a factory, working 60-70 hours a week on my feet, my entire right leg started to swell up along with a horrible pain in my lower back and shooting pains down my right hip. Being the responsible adult I am, I ignored it and kept working. My pain got to a point where I passed out at work and I took a few months off again. I've been working at my current job now since April and I'm in a comparable amount of pain coming home than when I was working twice as much. I just got an MRI yesterday but I can't get into see my doctor for almost 2 weeks to get the results. I'm on medical leave at work, but I'm really curious to see what you guys think. The pain has worsened just in the last 2 months and both my legs constantly hurt, sometimes they go numb when I'm just laying around. Any activity causes my lower back to hurt worse, sitting up straight hurts like hell and feels like it's building up pressure. Laying is the only position I'm comfortable in and even then the pain is horrible. I try to stay somewhat active by getting up and doing household chores but even with pain meds it's unbearable. I'm currently on week 2 of Prednisone and my doctor has prescribed me a few different muscle relaxers but I'm not having any luck with any of them helping. Other than that I've been taking Advil and Vicodin when it gets really bad but it's not helping anymore.\n\ntldr; my sciatic pain is getting unbearable and I want to know what you guys think the cause might be! 22(f) slightly active, pain worsens with activity and becomes, nothing I've tried helps"""

It also happened to be during graduation so unfortunately I look like crap in all my graduation photos and I don\'t want to see them because I cringe everytime I see them. In August last year I went to a doctor and she gave me tetracycline. After about a month of tetracycline it did get better, almost ""perfect"". During this time I was also travelling around the world so in february I ran out of pills. My host family in New Zealand managed to get me more pills but only enough for me to take one pill a day instead of two. I continued on one pill a day and things started getting worse. Now the last few months my face has been ok. I mean, it\'s still bad but it\'s better than it was last summer. My back has gotten worse though, a lot worse. It\'s so bad that I can\'t wear white or bright t-shirt, can\'t wear tank tops, can\'t do squats in the gym because it hurts too much putting the bar on my acne-infested shoulders.\n\nA few weeks ago I went to the doctor again and she booked a time for me with a dermatologist. The dermatologist didn\'t even hesitate to put me on Accutane (or Isotretinoin as it is called here now). I took my first three pills (3x20mg) a few hours ago.

I\'ll try to take some photos tomorrow of my back so you can see and also so that I can keep track of the progress.\n\nBy the way, I wonder, how bad can the muscle and joint pains be? I mean, I do work out quite a lot (2 hours four-five times a day). Normally I don\'t get very sore the days after, just light/moderate DOMS but will it get unbearable now when being on accutane? Has anybody combined accutane with weight lifting?\n\n**Update 2014-08-10** Five days in now. My knees and elbows have been hurting a bit, especially a few days ago, but it\'s manageable.

The worst side effect is probably my eyes. They are dry, especially in the evenings. I find it hard to stay up for long since my eyes start getting really dry at like eight or nine o clock in the evening. I\'m also feeling a bit tired in general but I don\'t know if it\'s the medicine or something else causing that.\nI haven\'t noticed any improvement at all when it comes to the acne. It has gotten worse, especially in the face. But I\'m patient and I hope that it will turn better soon.\n\n**Update 2014-08-13** A bit more than a week in now. My face is getting incredibly dry and I\'ve had a massive outbreak in my face the last few days. Yesterday I showered at the gym after the workout but I forgot to bring my moisturizer, big mistake! I had to rush home as quick as I can to get hold of some moisturizer to put on my face. I was afraid my whole face would crack if I opened my mouth or smiled or anything. Right now I have to put moisturizer on my face about 10-15 times a day, lip balm just as much. My back is fine with getting lotion only once a day. My face has been really painful yesterday and today, can\'t open my mouth too much, can\'t smile and so on. It\'s been getting a little better the last few hours now so hopefully it\'s even better tomorrow. I had a look in the mirror just now before going to bed and my back is a lot less red than it used to be. The pimples are also less swollen and red, they\'re just small white things now, at least most of them. Something I didn\'t expect was my mood to change. I get sad/angry a lot easier than before and life just feels tough at the moment. I am a little bit nervous as well, moving cities on Saturday, which means I will move in to an apartment with two other people. I wont be able to make the first impression I want to make, but I guess I\'ll just have to explain it to them... Starting university on Tuesday next week, hopefully my face looks a bit better by then, because I wont be able to explain it all to hundreds of people. I just hope nobody will judge me for what I look like at the moment. I hope they understand the pain I\'m suffering and I hope they wont stare at me or ""remind me"" to wash my face more often or some other bullshit.'"
codeine eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/poy1ie/am_i_just_making_it_up/,b'Am I just making it up?',,"b""Hey guys. \n\nHope you're doing well and keeping safe. \n\nI would be grateful if I could gain some advice. I have read a few of the posts here and it seems we all have  similar issues. Below are my issues:\n\nBut first a little background, before I started questioning life and everything around me last year sometime, I was one of those people that just got on with things and just did it. \n\nFast forward a year and a half, I have been stuck I feel. I don't seem to have any desire. Its a bit of puzzle, I want to improve but I don't care enough to. I know I need to improve but I don't realise that actively in my head. \n\nI am always full of excuses and I realise this. I feel shitty and no matter what I achieve it never feels enough. I recently graduated, I have a really caring and loving girlfriend who loves me more than the world. But I don't appreciate her enough in my eyes. \n\nI have a drug problem, nicotine and codeine. Can't seem to think straight without these fuckers in my system. I don't have the balls/will to believe that my life will be better if I stop this. I understand that I should and should cherish life but nothing seems worth it.\n\nI have a part time job and I am doing a professional qualification. Covid fucked my professional plans and I fell into depression and slowly working myself out of it.\n\nThings have been working out for me recently but, like I mentioned earlier, I am not able to appreciate it. I don't really care about money, even though I feel I  should. \n\nI am not able to keep a singular focus and thinking pattern. I want to make a change in a way that's meaningful to the world but I feel bogged down on life.\n\nJust having read what I wrote back, I see the issue of not being able to stay focused and care about things that I feel I should. Tbh, most people tell me I'm doing fine but I know I'm not. I could be better and I want to be. But I want to escape this demon in my head that holds me back.\n\nYes, what does this have to do with ADHD? I'm not sure man, but I feel like it does. My thinking behind it, if I am able to focus and do the things I need to then I won't be feeling so shit. Oh also, I failed two classes of my master's and I am currently on a break from it.\n\nWhat do you guys think, do I genuinely have a issue or am I making shit up. I would be grateful for your opinions. Please hit me with reality and don't hold back. I genuinely need it.\n\nI deeply appreciate your kind time."""

Medical history is significant for Persistent Depression with anxiety, PTSD with panic attacks and derealization, and chronic migraine. \n\nHPI\n\n* The body pain has lasted approximately 12 years and is progressively worsening over time. The pain is achy and is more intense in the lower extremities than upper extremities. The lower extremities also have episodic tingling lasting multiple hours per day. LE pain is worse in mornings and improves with exercise, but is then worse at the end of the day leading to RLS. Muscles are constantly tight. Nearly all joints pop loudly on active and passive motion. Slow to recover from weight lifting. \n   * NSAIDs do not improve the pain. Gabapentin takes the edge off. Duloxetine has notably decreased pain, but am at 90mg (30mg more than evidence supports). Venlafaxine helped but caused shaking. Fluoxetine and escitalopram did not improve sx. Orthotic insoles did not significantly help LE pain or back pain. *Hot water baths decrease LE pain considerably.* *Placing legs up towards ceiling decreases pain temporarily.* \n   * Mildly elevated CK\n* Non Refreshing sleep has lasted approximately 15 years when I was sleeping through most of my high school/middle school classes. Excessive daytime sleepiness occurred throughout life. Takes 15-30 min to fall asleep. Occasional insomnia >4 hours. Hypnogogic hallucinations of ""exploding head syndrome,"" musical hallucinations (every night), and occasional hypnogogic visual hallucinations of ""waviness"". On waking in morning, pt takes > 6 hours for sleep inertia to be relieved. Endorses occasional ""sleep drunkenness,"" persistent brain fog, occasional difficulty understanding speech, and moderate/persistent word finding. Gaps of time disappear quickly and easily. Pt has multiple witnessed gasping events. Roughly 6 naps per day without medication, and 2 naps per day with medication. \n   * Caffeine is effective in relieving EDS but have only started drinking in the past few years, and caffeine increases body pain over time. Quitting caffeine decreases pain but worsens EDS. Bupropion minorly improved sx. Armodafinil 200mg initially improved sx, but now ineffective (Modafinil caused headaches). Adderall ER 30mg greatly improved EDS and depressive sx for >3 months. \n      * Home sleep study: all negative (patient did not sleep, but EEG says otherwise)\n      * Hospital sleep study: Dx with RLS\n      * Hospital sleep study with mslt: all negative (including RLS)\n   * (Ropinirole and Pramipexole ineffective for RLS. Gabapentin 600mg has given some relief.)\n   * (Adderall and armodafinil are prescribed for severe EDS/hypersomnia, but I did not meet criteria of idiopathic hypersomnia. Thus insurance denies Xywav.)\n\nPMH\n\n* PDD with anxiety diagnosed 3 years ago. Positive for all SIGECAPS except suicidality. Improvement in all depressive symptoms over past 3 years despite switching SSRIs frequently (>3 months each). Episodic recurrences lasting 2-3 weeks with increasing levels of body pain and EDS then sx subside without intervention. *Currently in refractory episode.* \n   * TSH and T4 are WNL. Vit D wnl. \n* PTSD with panic attacks and derealization diagnosed 3 years ago. Panic attacks 1x/2 wks since inciting incident and PTSD diagnosis. Pt was chased for extended time mugged in foreign city. CBT and xanax prn have improved intensity and decreased frequency of panic attacks. *Panic attacks occur only 3 times/yr now.* \n* Migraines >15 month. Treated with CGRP antagonist. Decreased to \\~3 month responding to triptans. Following with neuro. \n   * Hit in head with rifle butt at 8yo leading to large mildly erythematous swelling on forehead. Did not go to hospital. Did not pass out. No other recognizably related symptoms. \n* Recent MRI taken for chronic migraine and very mild nystagmus. No abnormality reported. \n\nSocial\n\n* Heavy substance abuse **in college**: Marijuana/dabs used >10x/wk. Binge drinking >10 beers every other weekend. LSD used >1 time/month. Cocaine/ketamine/MDMA/Xanax occasionally. Mushrooms 2x/yr. Cigarettes 2 pack/wk. 1 gallon of coffee/day. \n   * currently abstinent for all drugs and cigarettes for >3 years.

Skin not stretchy. \n* Lower extremity hyperreflexia. \n* BL carpal tunnel syndrome\n* Vitals almost always WNL\n* IBS mixed. Colonoscopy to rule out IBD\n\nAssessment/Discussion: \n\n* At this point, my sleep doctor says I have idiopathic hypersomnia and continues to treat me for that despite not meeting the diagnostic criteria. Treatment has at least improved my life granted it isn\'t a cure. \n* Psych Etiology: I think I have too many neurological symptoms to think this is a pure psychological issue. However, I have so many negative test results, it makes me feel like I have Factitious Disorder. I recognize I also have psychiatric issues though, which may have physical manifestations. \n* OSA: This has been my personal working diagnosis for a long time. I can become partially obstructed without even falling asleep all the way. I didn\'t fall asleep at the home sleep study, but I also didn\'t have obstructive symptoms at the 2 hospital sleep studies. I can\'t be prescribed a CPAP without an official diagnosis. \n* Venous Insufficiency: one vein bulging out, but placing legs to ceiling REALLY helps. I\'ve also been wearing compression socks for years without knowing they had an effect besides pain relief. \n\nDifferential Diagnoses\n\n* Fibromyalgia: possible but rare for a male in his 20s\n* Rheumatologic disease: \n   * Ankylosing spondylitis- achilles enthesitis, inflexible lower back, pain persists with rest and at night\n   * Rheumatoid Arthritis\n*  Myopathy - sensation of muscle wkness but 5/5 strength\n* Ehlers Danlos: The only symptoms I have are bendy fingers and chronic pain, but idk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see my PCP and sleep doctor soon. If they can\'t provide answers, I might consider seeing a rheumatologist. \n\nDespite my symptoms, I think I have a good quality of life. I do think it could be heavily improved however with some sort of treatment. \n\nI would really like some help here. Or at least some perspective. My PCP has long since given up, and my sleep doctor is a maniac.'"
Tetracycline vomit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/rftpvd/if_anyone_is_contemplating_about_starting_do_it/,b'If anyone is contemplating about starting: do it',,"b'I cant describe the happiness that these pills have given me. \n\nI have tried every cream, scrub and anti-acne remedy available to me, and nothing worked. Are you in the same boat? Then do it. Of course discuss with your dermatologist first, and look into possible severe side effects that may occur because of genetics (have a family member or maybe more that suffer from chronic migraine or joint pain? Chronic and genetic skin conditions? Its still a drug used to cure or lighten a disease, its not playing around, this is for some a last option, dont let it be your first if you havent tried the simple stuff yet)\n\nBut again, acne is horrible for some, and this post is not meant to deter you, but to give you hope, enlighten and inform you of a way out of what acne is: a skin DISEASE keeping you from enjoying life to the fullest and not worrying about your skin and what others think about it. Dont let your skin hold you down when there is a way out.\n\nThe side effects are nothing compared to the feeling and relief of clear or even just clearer skin. I was lucky not having much acne on my face, but my chest, back, neck and shoulders were covered with cysts, bloody pimples, white and blackheads since forever. It really never bothered me before starting in Denmarks equivalent of high school, with gym classes having to strip naked and take a bath with 50-60 boys at once. I covered my self, or waited to take a bath. I didnt go swimming in the lake at summertime, I didnt take off my hoodie even though it was 100 degrees outside. But now I do, all thanks to these pills. I cant believe how hidden these pills are in Denmark. No ads no recommendations. I had to cry to my mom and in front of my doctor for him to mention them, and Im glad he did. So I spread the word and I think you should too, these pills have saved me from anxiety and probably also from depression. I think its safe to say it saved many people from depression and suicide. \n\nDont worry about the dry skin you will get, dont worry about dry lips, dont worry about feeling extra sore after gym. Youll live, but your acne wont. \n\nI had a purge after roughly one month, and I know see proper clearing after 3 months. I ruined some white t Shirts in the process but I dont care. The only thing I regret is not starting earlier.\n\nI tried a 6 month process with tetracycline, and had to stop after 4 months because of the vomiting, pain, headaches and diarrhea. I tried all the acid based, retinoid based, and nature based creams: all gave me eczema or worse. I tried all the natural scrubs: only sore skin and acne that spread like it was contagious.\n\nI tried dieting, cutting out all the unnecessary fats, sugars and protein. It didnt help. \n\nAcne is a sickness, a disease, a bacterial infection of the dermis. Stop treating it like a phase, like a common simple teenager thing; its not. \n\nDo it. Youll thank yourself, your dermatologist, your skin.\n\nSincerely,\nA teenager finally freee'"

penicillin swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/2qlbi3/looking_for_advise_on_current_routine/,b'Looking for advise on current routine',,"b""To preface: I'm 16 years old. Around two months ago I started breaking out. I've always had mild acne, but over the course of a few weeks my entire face was covered with acne and red raised skin. I went from almost no acne to both of my cheeks, chin, and hairline covered with the stuff. My routine for the past 2 years has been regular 2% salicylic acid wash, but once my breakout began I started to use a 10% benzoyl peroxide wash. At the peak of my breakout, (around the first week of this month) I finally went to a dermatologist, and ended up getting a laser treatment to bring down my swelling, and a culture on my acne to make sure it wasn't a staph infection. I was prescribed [acticlate](http://www.drugs.com/mtm/acticlate.html) (oral 75mg), [sumadan](http://www.drugs.com/pro/sumadan-wash.html) (sulfur) wash, [ziana](http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-146309/ziana-topical/details), [aczone](http://www.rxlist.com/aczone-gel-drug.htm), and [clindamycin phosphate](http://www.rxlist.com/clindamycin-phosphate-topical-solution-drug.htm). The routine given was:\n\n> Morning: Sumadan wash, aczone, and clindamycin (then moisturize).\n\n> Before bed: Sumadan wash, aczone, and ziana (then moisturize).\n\nLast week my culture came back negative for staph. I had done this routine for 3 weeks and I didn't get the slightest result. I was hopeless and started to experiment. Two days ago I abstained from the topicals (azone, clindamycin, and ziana) and only stuck to the sulfur wash and acticlate (plus moisturizer). Ever since then my swelling has gone down at least 70% and I'm not getting any new acne. \n\nIt's worth mentioning I'm allergic to penicillin, amoxicillin, and  a range of other antibiotics. Is it dangerous to suddenly abstain from my topicals? Am I allergic to my topical creams? My skin hasn't been this much better in at least 50 days. My eating habits haven't changed (I eat fairly healthy) and I'm a runner (20+ mpw) so I drink a lot of water.\n\nI'm going to a new dermatologist soon due to a few problems I had with the former one who put me on these medications.\n\nSo my overall question(s): is it bad that I'm suddenly not taking my prescriptions anymore? Am I possibly allergic to them? Thanks in advance."""

Shouldn't the symptoms be the same as what I usually get with pollen allergy?\n\nCould it actually be the antibiotic?

I wonder if the acetaminophen would have made a big difference. I happened to have some dayquil and took a swig of that (probably another 15mg of dex). 2-3 hours go by. still nothing. I figure to call it quits on the cough medicine and just have some soup and keep loading up on water. I start feeling a little hazy, but I didn\'t think anything of it. another 45 minutes go by and i\'m really starting to feel funny, but just stay calm and keep drinking water.

The main effects are anxiety and paranoia.

Then around March, I started to have a Sore or tender breastbone with a slight urge to cough. The pain is just more slightly to the right than in the center. I went to Urgent care for them to do an ECG and they found nothing. I went to my General Care and I have been treated for Allergies, Asthma, Gerd & Costochondritis.

Any questions you have I will answer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright everyone, As you know I went to the Cardiologist yesterday and got the news. Apparently its called **pericarditis** and it commonly happens after infections like covid-19. However I have a long term form known as Chronic Constrictive Pericarditis as most cases only last a 4 to 6 weeks this can last from 3 months to over a year. Its easily treatable by Taking NSAIDs like Max strength Ibuprofen to reduce inflammation to allow the heart to heal, but some cases but rarely require surgery if severe scarring has occurred. I am going back today for a Cardiogram so my cardiologist can see if there is any long term damage (He doubts it as I am young and healthy). Thank you everyone for your ideas and suggestions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate 4/5/23\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs requested here is another update. As of now, I have gone through several other tests such as a barium swallow test, upper endoscopy, and chest x-rays. After further investigation by my doctor after reviewing all the data she has come to the conclusion that I have 2 separate problems. 1st is the chest pain she believes that covid has caused some long-term damage that has produced moderate asthma made worse by my stressful lifestyle, she has switched inhalers to albuterol sulfate 90 mcg which has been helping with the issue. As for the Burning throat, we are still going with GERD. However, my body is really only reacting well to famotidine 40mg tablets. I have had little to no results with anything else (omeprazole, esomeprazole, Pepcid, Pepto, Tums, ETC). I have been on this new medication as of 03/09/23 and have seen improvements in my energy and pain relief. I am now able to go outside and be active for extended periods of time (About an hour of light to moderate physical activity). I would say I have improved by around 50% to 60%. Not every day is perfect but it has been better and much more bearable than before. My girlfriend of 4 years sees my normal self coming back as well as my energy.

Cold air irritates it, talking becomes difficult due to pain. \n\nPain was so bad I went to the ER last month (had no dental insurance at this time) on June 6th and ER doctor said she believed it was an impacted wisdom tooth causing the radiating pain. She gave me a 10-day treatment of Penicillin (this medication caused light headiness each time a pill was takenI didnt know this was abnormal until recently), after completing the pain subsidedBeginning around July 1st the pain came back and is radiating to my temple, left side of jaw, and left side of neck with minor swelling. I find an emergency dentist who confirms lower left is impacted and also sitting in jaw bone and sitting on or extremely close to a nerve and says an oral surgeon is needed. She prescribed me Amoxicillin (7 day treatment) \n\nIve taken amoxicillin previously but this time, I had what I believe to be an allergic reaction, I had heat flashes and my cheeks became inflamed and rash likeBenadryl helped but I decided that I wasnt comfortable finishing this treatment (I only took 3 pills total of amoxicillin) My dentist prescribe me Clindamycin in place but now I am nervous to take it because a different dentist told me that he doesnt think me taking antibiotics back to back is safe for the good bacteria in my body and says I can run into complications like a fungi bacteria problem? Is this true? I am currently in pain and I am having a hard time finding a emergency oral surgeon, Im only being offered consultations in LATE September. What are the potential risks of not taking OR for taking this antibiotic after already having took one last month AND potentially having to wait until the fall for a surgical extraction? \n\nAny advice would be appreciated!'"

So far, I've had a history of CRSwNP that resulted in a surgery (alongside a septoplasty which fixed it but not fully as well as an adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, and I believe turbinate reduction) and I am basically allergic to everything. My doctors couldn't believe how my total IgE was over the 700s with somehow getting a positive reaction to every blood test they did, almost everything on the skin pricks, and especially to most foods (which make it almost impossible to even do an elimination diet). Currently I'm on a daily regimen of Nasonex, Claritin, Advair, and Singulair, although I switch up the Claritin often. I had Flonase but my doctor switched me to mometasone given insurance wants to see failures before moving me into XHance or Dupixent. Even so, on a regular basis, I don't often notice it, until I get this sharp pain in my inner ear where it swells up and I lose my hearing.\n\nMy pulmonologist is currently looking into whether or not I have AERD. He feels given the IgE, I could have eosinophilic, allergic, and exercise induced asthma.  Originally I didn't think I was allergic to Aspirin, but after realizing I did have an adverse reaction to Moltrin when I was young that no longer happens with NSAIDs, it may be a possibility. My PFTs are often normal, but my Methacholine Challenge came back positive (I believe they tested me at 1mL on the first run). My ENT has put me on allergy shots but was hoping that my Skyrizi usage for my psoriasis would help me out as well, but there has been discussion about starting Dupixent as well for my current situation. My pulmonologist doesn't like the idea as much, but overall as long as I don't trigger my asthma, I'm basically breathing fine and I'm healthy there \n\nWith the most recent CT, we see the polyps again in the same area, we still see the build up, but it brought up mastoids again (1st time in 2019 when I lived around NYC) with potential damage from it. At this point, I'm trying to figure out what is going on. My CBC and CMP have come up normal multiple times. We really don't know what's going on other than my body overreacting to basically everything.\n\nI just figured I'd post this to see if anyone has been in my position. This is just a combination of really strange things that I can't seem to figure out."""

Today was the pulling. My dentist was excellent in giving shots thankfully. The medicine kicked in and he began pulling. I could feel the tooth wiggling and slowly start to slip out and then crack as it broke free leaving one root behind. He worked swiftly to remove the last bits and then placed the cadaver bone. Such strange sensations feeling the tools scrape against the bone and feel the packing of material. Next up was stitches, I couldn't feel the tool insert the stitch but I could feel the sensation of the pulling of the stitch. Lastly I was asked to bite on gauze and they sent me home! SUPER happy to report there was ZERO pain from start to finish! \n\nFor any super nervous people getting molars pulled I can tell you everything felt odd but absolutely no discomfort! \n\nI was instructed to take extra strength Tylenol and regular Advil back to back every 6 hours and antibiotic 3 times a day. I will sleep elevated and currently have an ice pack on my cheek to try to reduce swelling. Also sneeze only with mouth open and blow nose gently. The stitches will dissolve in a week or so and a small white membrane will fall out and it's normal.\n\nHoping good news will come at my check in happening in a month!"""

Dentist is stumped, doesnt show up on x-rays'",,"b'M 22. Potentially worth noting I have a narrow pallete but only crowding on my lower jaw. Braces years ago, no retainer, my top teeth are still very straight.\n\nI describe the pain as a deep ache, it comes and goes. Sometimes its a 2/10 sometimes its a 6/10, sometimes its not there. It is not sensitive to anything specific (read what my dentist did below). Sometimes my lip tingles but its rare. It is localized in the first top left molar but sometimes travels to the ones behind it.\n\nI take both ibuprofen and acetaminophen occasionally, only the ibuprofen helps with the pain, and only very slightly (like not even worth taking a pill level of relief)\n\nSo timeline:\n\nAbout 2 years ago I started to get a bit of discomfort on my upper left side near my first and sometimes second molars. It was super occasional and extremely mild so I didnt think much of it (I know I know, bad of me).\n\nAfter about a year, it was getting more noticeable and frequent. In february (2022) I noticed my wisdom teeth were coming in (felt one poking through) and my whole jaw on that side would ache similarly to how this feels, so I assumed that was the cause of my discomfort. I saw my dentist who referred me to my oral surgeon, and at that time I mentioned my tooth. Because of money issues we could not x-ray it, and he said we would take a proper look at it when we can.\n\nI saw my oral surgeon in March. We took an x-ray, I did in fact need my wisdom teeth out. I had 1 impacted upper one in my RIGHT side, the left one (pain side) was vertical as it should be. I mentioned my painful tooth. He said he sees nothing on his x-ray, but its not the same kind as the one the dentist gives me.\n\nIn May I had my surgery (I had to wait because I had to save money). At this point my tooth was aching a lot as I described above. The surgery went very well. After the surgery, I had 4 dry sockets and a mild infection in the lower left. I went back and my surgeon did another x-ray, confirmed the infection, and gave me another round of amox which in fact cleared it up.\n\nIn June I saw my dentist again because during my surgery they knocked a filling off of my bottom left second molar. At this time I was healed but my holes were still open. I mentioned my tooth still hurts, and asked if they would look at the new x-rays my surgeon took after my surgery because I still could not afford ones from them. They called for a fax and got them within a few minutes, pulled them up, explained to me again how they were different than their regular x-rays, and then to the best of their ability confirmed they saw nothing abnormal.\n\n**At this point my tooth pain is almost constant and really hard to ignore. Its there from the moment I wake up until I go to bed, only occasionally letting up randomly through the day. It makes my bottom jaw tremble.**\n\nYesterday I saw my dentist for an oral exam and cleaning. I told him my tooth was still hurting and I think it must be a bad cavity. They did x-rays on my whole mouth and I do have some very small cavities that shouldnt be hurting mebut not in these teeth. He showed me my x-rays and explained what he looks for and how these teeth are perfectly healthy. He did some tests on these teeth, knocking them with tools, scratching, cold air, cold water, a weird icy gel. Nothing increased the pain. He asked me about sweet foods and I said no increase of pain. He poked at my closed wisdom holes and pressed all around my pallete and gums and even around my uvula. He asked me if I had sinus issues and I said no so he had me stand up and touch my toes to see if the pressure makes it hurt more but it made no difference. He said my gum seemed very healthy too. Ive never seen bewilderment in a medical professionals eyes so I started to get worried. He told me he has no idea why it hurts, it shouldnt hurt.\n\nHes told me to talk to my family doctor about checking my sinuses, which I am going to do, but I dont think its my sinus. Its a deep ache within the tooth and gum area, on the outside more than the inside.\n\nJust wondering if anyone has any other ideas on what it could be, as it didnt show up on either x-ray. Im really suffering here! Ouch!!!'"
corticosteroid problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/wb07j7/constant_nasal_congestion_poor_sleep/,b'Constant nasal congestion - poor sleep',,"b""Hi, 20 year old male here with a history of nasal congestion for as long as I can remember. For the past 2 years, it has been extremely frustrating as I've started having dyspnoea as well (which my doctor suspects might be a product of bad sleep, anxiety and possibly the nasal congestion). They did different tests, x-rays to exclude other possible causes for my breathlessness and dyspnoea, they were fine. I have been sleeping horribly with constant anxiety, but the worst of it has been the nasal congestion that's become much worse than before. It has reached a point where I sometimes don't sleep at all, well a lot of the times I don't sleep. I'm lucky if I can sleep 3-5 hours per night. Last year, I had a septoplasty due to enlarged turbinates and obviously my deviated septum. It worked for maybe a month or less before the congestion returned. About 6 or 7 months ago I had a radiofrequency turbinate reduction, and I didn't see any very noticeable results. So I've been keeping in touch with my doctors, whom now think that I have vasomotor rhinitis. I have done allergy tests, and I'm supposedly allergic to pollen, timothy/grass, birch, mugwort, dog etc. But since I have problems with my congestion year around, they suspect vasomotor rhinitis being the culprit. Now I'm set up for an upcoming rhinomanometry (measure airflow and resistance in nose), before they decide if I should have any further surgeries and to get deeper insight. I'm really helpless here, I mean I've tried antihistamine pills, nasal sprays containing antihistamine and fluticasone (corticosteroids), nose oil, nasal rinses, nasal dilators but nothing seems to yield any results. Does anyone have similar experiences, or just any advice at all? It's making my life unbearable. I sometimes use nasal decongestant sprays, but rarely, as I don't want to make it a habit or become dependent of it. Not sure what to do anymore. I'm afraid of developing Empty Nose Syndrome if I keep doing something to my turbinates, but at the same time I already feel like complete shit because of my crappy life quality. Any tips, suggestions or stories are appreciated. Ask any questions you would like. Thank you."""

I had asked him previously what I should expect from them and he said youll know it when you feel it.\n\nI also found my heart rate rising, which the manufacturer listed as a side effect that IMMEDIATELY warranted stopping the medication. I had insomnia which many online had said is a sign of amphetamine addiction/someone who doesnt have ADHD will experience.\n\nI called my psych about it who immediately called me in to check my heart.

Still have my tonsils. Once around 8 or 9, I woke up and couldn\'t move my body from the waist down and was hospitalized. They couldn\'t find anything wrong. Once around 12 I was leaking whiteish liquid from my breasts and they thought it may be cancer. It was not. Around 13/14 I started feeling very light headed in the shower and my vision would go black and I couldn\'t hear anything. Pediatrician said I was anemic and deficient in vitamin D. Prescribed salt pills and vitamin D. Struggled a lot in school in comparison to others despite heavy studying and attending tutoring often, from elementary to high school. Periods very painful, heavy, and lasted around10-12+ days. Started taking birth control pills at 19 and have been skipping periods since then. I have about 4-5 periods a year. Never been pregnant. No STDs. Only major surgeries: wisdom teeth removal twice, sesamoidectomy (foot) surgery 2021. Took accutane twice as a teenager. Have had bad skin since about 6 years old, acne, premature aging by 18. Had braces twice, teeth/jaw/bite still not right. TMJ problems, will need jaw surgery in the future. Have always gotten a burning sensation in my throat when running/vigorous exercises, and have to stop early not because I can\'t push my body any further, but because my throat\'s on fire. Shin splits always happen when doing cardio. When I was about 20 I gained about 40lbs within 2 months (side effect from medication) and was told I was prediabetic. I\'ve since lost the weight, no longer prediabetic. I\'ve had 3 concussions and 1 major seizure (caused by medication). September 2021 had excess white blood cells in urine at gyno appointment. Always been tired no matter how much sleep I get. Body does not respond to caffeine. Can be difficult to do normal or even fun things when I\'m often exhausted, physically and mentally. Fatigue/brain fog/memory problems for as long as I can remember. Very pale, inability to tan, very sensitive to the sun, skin burns very easily (can happen in less than 10 mins without sunscreen. I now wear sunscreen everyday).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**What doctors have said:**\n\nInsurance at the time required referrals to see specialists. My **first PCP** *refused* to refer me to an ENT *for several months* (I\'m talking I got sick in September 2020, verbally requested around October then several times via email and calls and during checkups, and didn\'t see the ENT until MAY 2021!! and this doctor also missed a whole broken bone in my foot so...love that for me) because *she was offended* that I didn\'t ""trust her"" to solve my issues on her own (even though it was all telehealth and she never actually physically examined me???) But I eventually got them to get me a referral.\n\n**ENT** *confirmed there is a lot of mucus indeed stuck in my throat*. She put a camera up my nose and down my throat (I was not prepared for that btw, not fun). However she said that since it was too far down and ""around a corner"" per say, she couldn\'t use her tools to get it out for me and instead prescribed some meds that did nothing. She said I have acid reflux and gave me instructions on how to reduce it. I did everything suggested and reflux is rare now, but the problem still remains. After 2ish months she confirmed again there\'s still mucus back there. But the good news is she said I don\'t have any vocal cord damage which is amazing. But she also mentioned she\'s never had a patient with the same issues I have and doesn\'t know how to help at this point, I just love hearing that from my doctors. She suggested I see a GI specialist. Had to pause all visits for about 6 months bc I lost my insurance after quitting my extremely toxic/abusive workplace.\n\nThe gaslighting starts here with the **GI specialist** who *ran zero tests*, said I was too young to be having these issues (okay so explain why I\'m having them, and shouldn\'t it be alarming that I\'m having these issues ""so young""?). She suggested it\'s likely ""just anxiety."" She said I should have stuck with working with an ENT for my problems, didn\'t understand why I was referred to her, but gave me a prescription to try anyway. Surprise, it didn\'t help.\n\nThe **Allergy specialist** I saw was a sweet old lady and I really believe she tried everything she knew. Worked with her for about 6 months. Said I was positive for a sinus infection and said that it\'s likely what I\'ve had the entire time. Did a pulmonary function test and said my breathing was abnormal and my lung capacity is much worse than it should be at my age and given lifestyle. She treated me for the sinus infection and later gave me an inhaler to take twice a day, along with an emergency inhaler to use before exercise. At a follow up she said my lung capacity was at 70. I still don\'t know exactly what this means, but it didn\'t sound good. I suggested wanting to get a chest x-ray done, and to see a pulmonologist at this point and she agreed. Got chest x-ray done, she called me and said ""everything looks fine"" and that was it on that. I got a food allergy test done bc at this point I\'m thinking something I\'m eating everyday could be the cause, but no. (I will say I\'d like to redo the test with another ENT for a second opinion, bc the way this test was carried out was unusual imo) After this, she told me my body is so sensitive and she\'s tried everything and doesn\'t know how else to help me. I just about lost it right there, it was just so devastating to hear. One of her final suggestions was that it could be ""a minor cough"" like she has, and/or it could be all in my head from \\*drumroll\\* *anxiety*. Even after having proof from the ENT that there is definitely mucus there and I\'m not imagining it. Just wonderful.\n\nSaw a **pulmonologist** and they *completely dismissed me* and *didn\'t test me for anything*. Said something along the lines of, ""honey this is just anxiety what you\'re describing, us women have it, it\'s very common!"" and that anxiety can create a ""lump in the throat"" sensation, but nothing is there. DESPITE AN ENT STICKING A CAMERA DOWN MY THROAT AND CONFIRMING SOMETHING IS IN THERE! *She suggested trying regular, over the counter meds that I\'ve already tried. ((wow, doctor you cured me!!))* This interaction was infuriating!\n\nWent to a **naturopath** to see if alternative medicine would work for me. They drew my blood, forgot to test me for immunodeficiencies/autoimmune disorders (love that), but did state that my B12 was low and my vitamin D is one of the lowest she\'s ever seen (no shock to me, I\'ve always been told this since I was a kid, I just hadn\'t taken vitamins in a while). Suggested I buy her expensive vitamin supplements, but I just got some from amazon bc I just couldn\'t afford vitamins for over $70/month each. She also asked me about my past and family life and said that *sometimes when you hold on to trauma too long, it can cause problems with your gut health* which is where our immune system is etc and can become weakened, and manifest into physical illnesses that won\'t go away until the trauma is correctly processed and immune system is healed. On one hand it sounds far out, but on the other hand it did kind of make sense. But at the same time, for me, I know my issues started as an actual illness. She said I need to start therapy, (and also purchase a very expensive controversial water therapy program she was selling) but at that time I couldn\'t afford that.\n\nFound a **new** **pulmonologist** on a whim while just messing around on google maps in my area and decided to give it a try. Went to my first appointment with him about 2 weeks ago, told him everything, showed him my x-rays. This is the first doctor I\'ve seen so far that seems like he actually cares. He told me *he believes me*, and knows it isn\'t "" just anxiety"" and that he will try his very best to help me. I felt so validated and so heard and understood that day. He said the x-rays do not indeed look normal and ordered a chest CT scan. He suggested that I stop using my inhaler bc it was likely *making my problems worse* by drying out my throat, which causes my body to super overproduce mucus. Also prescribed a **nebulizer** to use twice a day, and told me to take regular **Mucinex without the D** so I can try to cough some of the mucus up. I\'ll be going in for a follow up next week for my results.\n\nWent to my **new PCP** also about 2 weeks ago. He was also a shining star in my eyes, bc he also seems very caring and really wanted to help me. He said he sees weird and unique situations all the time so he seemed confident in helping me. They drew some blood that day, and also wanted me to get a 2nd round of bloodwork done somewhere else for more in depth tests/results. I have an appointment next week for the 2nd round of bloodwork, and will have a follow up soon after that. In the meantime, they called with the first half of my results, saying my **B12 was high** but that\'s okay, that my **vitamin D levels are insanely high** and could result in vitamin D toxicity so cut back on the dosage, and that my **blood** **platelet count was a lot higher than usual**, but they said we\'ll discuss that further and also retest it at my next appointment. For context, they said the normal range is between 130-140, but mine was 421. From what I understand, the rest of the bloodwork will be tested for autoimmune disorders, thyroid issues, cancer and a few other things.\n\n**BONUS:** I\'m just getting over another upper respiratory infection that lasted about 3 weeks. During the 2nd week I had 3 instances within an hour while I was awake at home on my computer, where my throat was closing on me and I was gasping for air. Felt like I was gonna die. Decided to go to the ER (my partner drove me). The doctor there was one of the worst I\'ve ever encountered and he actually made me cry when we left. First thing he asked is, ""so, what exactly are you expecting me to do?"" ...I was shook to say the least. Didn\'t see that coming at all. I said, ""I\'m expecting you to help me."" He proceeds to tell me that ""this is an ER. You are not having an emergency. If you came to me WHILE you couldn\'t breathe, I could\'ve helped. But you\'re perfectly fine right now. You\'re not showing signs of panic or distress and your vitals are fine. So what do you expect me to do?"" VERY close to me, staring me down, speaking in a very condescending tone. I was just so blown away by his behavior and lack of empathy. I said, ""Okay, so how would you help me if my throat was closing or I had mucus blocking my airway right now, what would you do?"" He said, ""Well, there are so many different things we could do depending on the situation, I could shove a breathing tube down your throat, or even better, I could shove one of those tubes down your throat that we use on BABIES, kinda like when they have too many boogers in their noses and suck all of that stuff out of there."" The way he said that was definitely to make me feel bad and to compare my problem to a baby who can\'t blow their nose. Just insane. Something has to be done about the way patients are treated when seeking help. I understand some people go to the ER for nothing. But not everyone. I told him I felt like I was dying. He said he couldn\'t do anything and doesn\'t know what to tell me. All the medications I\'ve tried is something he would\'ve suggested, which, fair on that since I have tried a lot. But then someone came in with some paperwork for me to sign saying something about I agree that I was treated today, argued with her for a minute saying I wasn\'t treated. She gave me paperwork to take home and it said to take Allegra -\\_- I refused to sign the paperwork and left. I just thought that was such a wild situation I wanted to include it.\n\nSo, that\'s where I\'m at right now. I appreciate any comments, and thank you so much if you took the time to read this whole thing <3\n\n**TLDR:** I\'ve had mucus stuck in my throat for over 2 years that\'s too thick to cough up and after seeing several doctors and specialists no one can figure out what exactly is wrong, why this is happening or how to treat it. This is causing a laundry list of other problems including breathing problems, losing my voice daily, throat closing, and mucus blocking my airways which makes me feel like I\'m suffocating. I\'ve tried tons of medications. It is affecting my quality of life significantly. Looking for answers or comfort in knowing I\'m not the only one going through this.\n\n*\\*cross posted bc I\'m desperate for answers\\**'"
anticonvulsant problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/wiek1g/possible_rupture_of_tendon_or_ligament_in_jaw/,b'Possible rupture of tendon or ligament in jaw',,"b'Hi,\n\nThis will be a bit long and complicated story but I appreciate anyone who is willing to bear with me and maybe even give some input. So, here it goes:\n\nIn May I had a root canal procedure done on my left second premolar. On June 1st, I had an impacted left lower wisdom tooth removed. It was a complicated procedure. Since I also had to remove my upper left wisdom tooth, I wanted it to be done on the same day, but the surgeon for some reason did not want to, and scheduled the procedure for the 8th of June. On that day, I did not feel that the jaw was healed enough for another surgery and asked the oral surgeon for his opinion and he wanted to proceed with it. I agreed because: 1. I trusted he know what he is doing and 2. wanted to be done with it as soon as possible because I have to start treatment for MS as soon as I recover from wisdom teeth surgery. During surgery, at one point I heard the surgeon say to the assistant that he damaged something a tiny bit. I did not ask what after surgery.\n\nBecause I was eating smoothies and yogurt for a week already, after the second surgery I was starving, on the second day, I started eating normally because it seemed like I can. However, it was all good until I bit a hard piece and my jaw slipped to the side and I heard a very loud pop. It did not hurt. My jaw felt a bit loose. I could continue to eat but I had to be careful how I move my jaw because it was a bit loose. When I looked at the mirror, my jaw also looked a bit loose while I was opening and closing it. I have had TMJ problems for years, after Another wisdom teeth surgery in 2016, so I was used to jaw popping and deviating while opening. Although this seemed strange, I did not think much of it since there was no immediate pain. The pain started in the days that followed, but I attributed it to surgery. It only came when I bit into something and chewed. I went for control and to remove stitches, mentioned pain but not that popping incident, and since the wound looked okay they thought everything is okay. Pain when chewing worsened and I also developed eye pain, especially with eye movement. I went to the surgeon, and told him about the pain, he did x ray, and everything looked fine.\n\nThe day after that, I woke up and was almost blind in my left eye. Went to the emergency, got diagnosed with optic neuritis. No one wanted to talk about surgeries I had, because I have MS so it was a clear case of ON for them. After that, I went through hell. The pain worsened so much, I was in and out of ER without any answers. My jaw hurt, I had shooting pains from jaw up to top of my head, temples, tension headache in the back of my head and my neck. My left cheek felt tender and painful to touch, but it was not swollen and I could open my jaw. I went to the Faculty of dentistry where I got the procedure done every week or even a couple of times a week. Always without answers. My neurologist put me on anticonvulsants because he thought I had trigeminal neuralgia. Nobody wanted to talk about the connection between ON and surgeries. And when I asked if maybe I fucked up something with hard foods too early, they said no and brushed it off. I even went to maxillofacial surgery, and they said it is TMJ disorder without a thorough exam and sent me on my merry way.\n\nI still continued going to oral surgery, and they decided to do the revision of the upper wisdom tooth extraction site. After revision, I was in horrible pain, but the pain soon subsided because I was eating only smoothing and icing that area. However, whenever I tried to start eating anything I had to chew however soft it was, the pain would return. And if I continued doing that, pain in the eye would start. I also developed ear pain. After I went back on a smoothie diet, iced my jaw, and rested it as much as possible, the pain subsided. If I try to use my jaw, it returns.\n\nLast week, I did so much research because I was feeling that doctors were missing something. First, I stumbled upon temporal tendonitis, and it perfectly matched my pain patterns. I feel pain in the upper and lower molars, pain in the temple, back of the head, eye pain, and ear pain. Pain is aggravated when chewing. Then I remembered that loud pop and jaw looseness and now I feel pretty sure that I had some tendon or ligament rupture, that I continued to re-injury and that became very inflamed which triggered ON in my left eye. Tomorrow I will go again to the maxillofacial surgery department and hopefully, now I will get some proper answers and help.\n\nI am scared that because 2 months went by since the injury, permanent damage is done. And I am scared that it was a complete rupture and now it healed improperly. Does anyone have any experience with jaw tendons and ligaments? Does loud pop always indicate a complete tear? Can it be repaired even after 2 months? Will it be able to heal or will I be doomed to eat smoothies for the rest of my life and always live with the risk of it again triggering ON?'"
acetaminophen swelling,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/y6w6vs,b'Root Canal or Wisdom teeth extraction?',"Image492.jpg, Image493.jpg, Image494.jpg","b'Im (18F) writing this Monday night. Last Friday night my bottom right first molar started hurting very can out of no where. It felt like pressure was being put on it. I took some Acetaminophen and slept though the night fine. \n\nI will add that as a child and most of my teens I struggled with keeping up with my oral hygiene due to mental health. Since moving out and living with my partner. I consistently brush and mouthrinse at least once a day and have since March of this year.\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning it was still bothering me all day. I brushed like normal after breakfast, being a bit more gentle around that tooth. Mouthrinsed like normal. Towards the end of the night I got a bottle of the Red Cross Clove Oil for toothaches. I followed the instructions and after a few rounds of using it, my gums started bleeding. \n\nAt this point it hurt to bite down on the crown at all but it feels like it had shifted up over by my second pre molar. Almost like if it was put on incorrectly or how my temporary crowns felt. There was also some pain on my premolars and they felt like they are being pushed forward, which is unusual because almost all of my teeth have a bit of spacing in between, especially towards the front of my mouth.\n\nI did not sleep at all that night, I was taking Acetaminophen and Diphenhydramine hoping I would crash but I did not.\n\nNext morning we went to Rite Aid again. This time I got the 4x Orajel Blue Gel, some Naproxen, and Doxylamine Succinate so I could finally sleep. I finally felt some relief and slept for a few hours.\n\nThat night came and went. When trying to sleep I woke up every hour on the dot it seemed like. This morning I start making calls and get into my dentist. \n\nI got in at 2pm and he came in and said it was my wisdom teeth coming in and pushing but since its still under the bone in my mandible I have to find an oral surgeon to be put under. But he didnt take an X-Ray or anything, just took a peek in my mouth.\n\nWell through tonight I noticed it swelling more and more. While the pain has actually lessened it still hurts to bite on my crown. \n\nIm just not sure which it is and want a second opinion i guess.'"

NSAID problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/12etu9h/rough_crown_turned_root_canaldo_i_need_a_new/,b'Rough crown turned root canal--do I need a new dentist?',,"b'I\'ve had a real rough time of it lately tooth-wise, and I could use some advice as to whether this is normal and I\'ve just had really bad luck, or if I should find another dentist.\n\nPresenting problem was a cracked tooth with previous fillings that had developed a cavity. Dentist said it needed a filling and a crown, but not a root canal. Tooth didn\'t hurt much but had some sensitivity. I generally trust my dentist, said ok, lets do this.\n\nThe crown appointment was rough. They had to give me three or four shots, and still didn\'t get me fully numb. Mouth, lips, and tongue were numb, but not the tooth fully. I could feel it when they drilled down really deep. Fortunately, the part I could feel was at the very end, and they finished, installed the temporary crown and sent me home.\n\nAs soon as the numbing wore off, I was in PAIN. Aching pain within the tooth that over the counter pain relievers helped with, but it always came back, and got worse as time went on. Waited about a week, when it started waking me up in my sleep, which the dentist had said to watch for, and then called my dentist. They had me come in that day and did some tests and a bite adjustment. Sanded the tooth down really far because they kept having me bite on a bite stick and if I said it hurt, they took more off. It always hurt.\n\nThe pain didn\'t go away, and continued to worsen. Called several days later, and the dentist said to give it more time, and if I ""couldn\'t take it"" by the time the appointment for the crown installment, they could do a root canal instead. \n\nThe pain continued to worsen, and at my appointment I was given the option of putting on the permanent crown and waiting the pain out, or having the root canal. I opted for the root canal.\n\nThey again couldn\'t get me numb in that specific tooth for the root canal, despite giving me four or five shots (I lost count) at different points in the procedure when I said I felt pain, and in the end the problem nerve was still ""live"" when they pulled it out. They had to take breaks for me to cry and shake because I was in so much pain, and the initial shots were also excruciating. I asked for gas to take the edge off, but they didn\'t offer that. Once they got the problem nerve out it was fine, but it was an ordeal to get to that point. I was very sore for... three or four days after that, but it has gone better as time has gone on.\n\nI have my second root canal appointment next week, and I am dreading it, even though the problem nerve is now gone. My understanding is that they need to make sure the tooth is clean, fill it, and attach the permanent crown. Is this going to hurt? Can I trust my dentist to finish this properly?

codeine problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/qj6ma5/do_i_have_comorbid_adhd_and_autism/,b'Do I have comorbid ADHD and autism',,"b"" I'm 23 and have seen two psychiatrists and they've said that they're sure I have some mental/neurodevelopmental disorder but they can't pinpoint what it is exactly.  \n\n\nEver since I was a child I would get into a lot of trouble. I was polite but extremely impulsive (moreso than other kids my age) and used to lose things and forget to turn off the tap/TV which would get me beaten by my father. I didn't seem to learn a lesson. I also had an extraordinarily good memory (not me saying this but others) which I still have to this day.  \n\n\nI was never able to make friends as I'd weird/annoy people. I experienced severe depression and thoughts of suicide back in 2011. In late-2012, something happened which changed my life completely. I experienced euphoria like never before. I took ecstasy and cocaine two years ago and was stunned by how I could have felt exactly like that as a kid without taking any substances. I had so much motivation to do anything. For the entirety of 2013, I genuinely believed that my life would be happy and trouble free. I did well in school but eventually became to euphoric that I forgot to study. I also attempted to castrate myself after listening to Sting's - If I Ever Lose My Faith In You. One thing that a lot of people mentioned (and still do today) is that I had a creepy grin on my face. A guy in my class in school actually thought I was high all the time because he said I had a constant grin.  \n\n\nThe next year, the depression returned only this time, it lasted for the whole year. It was really horrible and one night in November, I felt horrible. The next week my mother and I got into an argument and I assaulted her physically. Something I have never done and which shocked both of us.  \n\n\nI continued going to school but eventually I started making homicidal/suicidal comments which disturbed students and they told the principal in 2015. My principal contacted social service who contacted my parents and said that they'd have to bring me to a GP. My GP organised an appointment with CAMHS and I saw a psychiatrist the next month. I was prescribed the antipsychotic Abilify and Prozac and though it got rid of my homicidal thoughts, I felt suicidal again as well as extremely tired. I stopped attending school physically and was homeschooled.  \n\n\nAfter failing school and having a bad experience with the psychiatric system I decided to start self-medicating. That's around the first time I discovered sites like erowid, bluelight, drugs-forum and Reddit's /r/drugs. My GP also gave me a large supply of benzodiazepines and that started my addiction. I soon started taking benzos, OTC opioids (codeine), nicotine, and alcohol. When I went to America, I tried my aunt's hydrocodone pills and loved them even more.  \n\n\nI came back to Europe and started forging scripts until I got caught and cautioned.  \n\n\nToday I'm drug-free (sort of) but still have difficulty making friends and I'm constantly called annoying, weird, and immature (my parents think me wanting to castrate myself is immaturity and I'm not sure about that). On the plus side, the same people who put me down also say I'm really smart but I'm not sure about that especially as I'm 23 and only entering college while others my age are out in the world working and living independently.  \n\n\nMy GP said he thinks I might have ADHD or Aspergers. He said that if it was the former, prescribing Ritalin, Adderall, or Vyanase would help my symptoms.  \n\n\nHe believes that I may have been mistakenly diagnosed with Aspergers due to the difficulty making friends which is common in ADHD. The one difference though is that I have no problems reading peoples facial expressions and have no problem with eye contact (even maintain it for too long especially when looking at others). The other think that leads him to believe it's ADHD is my constant posting of random topics on the internet (I showed him my Bluelight posting history and Reddit posting history)."""
NSAID itch,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/psgvwv/very_itchy_skin_cannot_sleep/,"b'Very itchy skin, cannot sleep'",,"b""Hi all, I'm a 23yo, F from the UK, 61kgs, 5ft 4.  For about the last 5 weeks I've had extremely itchy hands, just the back and wrists, not the palms.  There was a red spotty rash on the back of them for around 2 weeks which went away but they are still itchy.  It usually wouldnt bother me but it's keeping me from sleeping. This doesnt happen during the day but I think this is because I'm distracted. Last week, a red, spotty rash appeared at the crease of my elbow which has been itchy and there are faint red spots on my other arm, with dry, scaly areas over my bicep.  \nThe first thing I'd like to ask is: should I be worried about lymphoma as i heard that can cause itching at night.  As far as i know, I've gained about 1.5kg in the last month.  I have two mobile lymph nodes in my neck which are symmetrical and about the size of peas.  The only other thing that has been bothering me about my health is, I get very dizzy when I stand up.\nThe second thing I'd like to ask is, anyone have any tips on how I can sleep through the itching? I've tried antihistamines and nsaid drugs but they dont help.  I've got an appt with my GP next Friday but I'm on so little sleep, I'd just like something to tie me over til then.  \n\nTIA :)"""

I\'ve included some symptoms and information below; \n\n\nAge: 15\n\nSex: Female\n\nHeight: 5""7\n\nWeight: 100 lb (Have lost around 14% of my body weight since this started, I could potentially be under 100 now)\n\nRace: Caucasian\n\nDuration of complaint: Worst symptoms came around December 31st (2016) but have been feeling generally ill since last summer.\n\nLocation: Canada\n\nLocation on body: Basically everywhere\n\n\nAny existing medical issues: Innocent heart murmur, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, persistent dilation, had Kawasaki when I was three, and malabsorption syndrome (extremely low vitamin D). However, after I fell ill last summer I went to the doctor and she believed that I had celiac, blood work came back negative and I never got a biopsy. At this point, I believe it\'s just an intolerance or sensitivity to gluten.\nCurrent medications: No, but I went to the ER for this before and they believed to be a UIT (after finding blood in urine) and was prescribed some antibiotics that had NO effect. I also took Advil and Acetaminophen and they both had very minimal (if any) effect. Went to the doctor, more tests, went to a walk in clinic and prescribed another antibiotic, no effect. Went to the ER and was given a laxative after my Xray showed severe constipation. Currently waiting on a prescription to help ease the pain (buscopan), but it\'s out of stock. \n\n\nMy CT scan couldn\'t see a lot of things so was inconclusive. I have a colonoscopy and endoscopy coming up.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n- Bloody diarrhea or very mushy feces after every meal (some black and red bits, and some pieces float)\n- Occasional constipation (it can go from diarrhea to constipation)\n- Nausea\n- Fatigue (I always sleep until 2:00, no matter what time I go to bed)\n- Vomit in mouth - sometimes have to spit it out\n- Swollen lymph node noted on CT scan as lymphadenopathy. This lymph node is extremely painful\n- Weakness\n- Eye floaters\n- Gas\n- Loud gurgling and other weird noises from stomach\n- Painful feet and clubbed nails on toes. As this has progressed, more nails have started clubbing. (Horizontal ridges as well)\n- Extreme abdomen pain. (Can be like a knife, clenching, biting, fire, etc.) My pain has gone from occasional to constant, but extreme pain will \'flare up\' and last a few seconds. \n- Bloating\n- Tender stomach\n- A fever\n- Chest pain\n- Back pain\n- Headaches\n- Poor appetite\n- Dry lips\n- Itchiness with occasional blotches\n- The pain is getting much worse, and I have no pain killers that work. This week has been the worst week yet. \n- Constantly feel like I need to have a bowel movement\n- Can barely walk from the pain\n- Numbing in hands\n- Brain fog and extreme fatigue (like I lose all my energy after eating)\n- Gassy, I belch after every meal\n- Severe pain in rectum (occasionally burns)\n- When it first started, I had a low WBC, but that seems to have fixed itself.\n- Dehydration noted in my blood work.\n- Out of breath, trouble getting air.\n- Also, some other irregularities in my blood work, can\'t remember, though.\n- There are more symptoms, but this is all I can think of now\n\nOkay, so those are all the symptoms that I think are related.

Advil problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1k87fj/sighback_to_square_one/,b'Sigh...back to square one',,"b""This is a continuation of the last post I submitted here ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1gzclg/report_update_zinc_supplementation/)).  I was doing very well until I had a major dairy binge about two weeks ago.  At that time I also made a few changes to my regimen, introducing the Acne.org AHA lotion (AHA+ they call it) and 3mg of copper along with my daily 25mg of zinc.  So my daily regimen looked like this:\n\n* shower, use cold water for last 30 seconds of shower\n* optional shave\n* moisturizer + tea tree oil\n* 36mg zinc + 4mg copper (11mg zinc + 0.9mg copper provided by multivitamin)\n\n\nAt night:\n\n* cleanser (spectro jel)\n* half and half moisturizer and AHA+\n\nAbout 3 days after my massive dairy binge, involving cheesecake and pizza, I broke out like crazy and my skin hasn't been right since.  I'm mad at myself for that...I don't know why I thought it'd be okay to do that.  I feel like it's gotten a bit worse since then, too.  I stuck to this regimen strictly but I haven't noticed a very quick improvement like the last time my cystic acne came back.  I have a feeling that either the AHA+ or the added copper is hurting my progress, which is a shame.  I got a blood test a few weeks ago that showed my copper/zinc levels were fine, right before I started to take the copper, so I'm wondering if I was actually deficient in zinc in the first place and I might have screwed that balance up.  It's a real bummer, because I was clear for such a long period of time!  The reason I started the AHA was to speed up the process of getting rid of those, and it did help.  But I fear it might have made my acne worse in the process.  Another possibility is the cleansing step causing problems, as I've noted before.  I tried a few things, such as using a clay mask, BP spot treatment, using some nights with AHA on and some nights with it off, and upping to 50mg of zinc daily instead of 36, but I haven't noticed a marked improvement.  I've tried some anti-inflammatories too such as advil, aspirin, to no real avail.  So, I'm reverting to my last known good configuration, which is:\n\nDay:\n\n* shower, use cold water for last 30 seconds of shower\n* optional shave\n* moisturizer + tea tree oil\n* 36mg zinc + 0.9mg copper (11mg zinc + 0.9 copper provided by multivitamin)\n\nNight:\n\n* moisturizer + tea tree oil\n\nThat regimen seems to have worked the best for me, so far.  I'm thinking after I get it under control again, I'll try some kind of retinoid instead to get the redness down.  This may be TMI, but for the guys reading this, I'm going to also do /r/NoFap while abiding by this regimen, as I've read that it'll boost your zinc levels.  Whether it'll matter or not, well, hard to say.\n\nWish me luck, and as you all know I will keep you updated."""

(x-post from BipolarReddit)'",,"b""150 mg lamotrigine helped me a lot. I had to stop taking it due to rashes and birth control interaction.\n\nI'm currently seeing a psychiatric ARNP, she wanted to put me on seroquel which I didn't want because I was afraid of sleeping all the time and gaining weight. So she prescribed Wellbutrin, but refused to prescribe anything along with it because she believes in prescribing one medication at a time and seeing how I react to it before adding anything else.\n\nThat bothered me because I wanted her to prescribe something else to treat the anxiety and sleep problems I already have and know are likely to be increased by Wellbutrin, but reading more about it it sounds like I shouldn't be on an AD without a mood stabilizer at all. I thought it seemed irrational to prescribe a med by itself and see how it affects me when it's predictable that it will affect me negatively when taken alone.\n\nShe only scheduled a 30 minute appointment (my second appointment with her) and I didn't really feel like we had time to talk and she charges the same amount for 30 minute visits as 60 minute visits.\n\nEarlier this year a GP put me on sertraline/Zoloft and after about two weeks on a low dose I quit it because it made me more anxious than usual and caused sleep problems. I know wellbutrin is safer than Zoloft but I'm still concerned. I took my first 150 mg dose this morning and I have a headache despite Advil. I'm considering calling her and saying I want to not take my meds until I see her again next week - I have an hour long appointment.\n\nThis isn't fun. I wish I could feel the way I did on lamotrigine but without rashes or risk of pregnancy. Maybe I should have accepted the seroquel. If I can find a different psych who accepts my insurance and has an opening soon I might switch.\n\nI know there's nothing too interesting here but I just needed to vent.\n"""

I get EXTREME stomach pain and nausea from all NSAIDs, even at low doses, even with food, so ibuprofen isnt an option (seems to be the standard recommendation).

I think Ill ask for codeine since it seems to be a weak opiate, was just wondering if there were any alternatives.

The surgeon didnt mention or explain a thing unless I asked which I thought was odd. I also am allergic to a good amount of antibiotics and tend to have extreme reactions to them (and medications in general).\n\nAlso, if I get dry socket, can a regular dentist treat that?

corticosteroid swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/71s88n/allergist_wont_see_me_because_of_antihistamine/,"b""Allergist won't see me because of antihistamine addiction.""",,"b'Edit: Holy cow. What a whirlwind ride this has been since finding out its not just allergies. \n\nI got the CT Scan for the nasal polyps. They said all but one sinus was 100% blocked. They said no allergy medicine, steroid, decongestants, anything could have done jack for me. So, 3 days ago, they did ""The ol\' scraperoo"". Took out ALL the nasal polyps, and widened my sinuses for better drainage. It took about 7 hours from when i was put under to when i woke up. Apparently it may have been the worst case that the ENT has seen, and the files from it are being discussed around the whole office as something like a freak show (or maybe something to learn from, lol). It\'s only been 3 days since they did this, and this is WILD! I CAN BREATHE! I am so delighted already about this. I can\'t believe I\'ve been suffering for so long, panting out of my mouth, not able to smell, sniffle, or breathe even for a few minutes for the past year, thinking this was my life forever. \n\nBut, it comes at a price. I do have a very strict daily regimen of care to try to keep it this way. With how bad the polyps had gotten, that fast, it will be a challenge to keep them under control. For the rest of my life, I will be on:\nA daily nasal rinse to rinse out allergens from my sinuses.\nA daily nasal steroid to keep polyps in check and keep swelling down.\nA daily Singulair, a daily antihistamine, a daily inhaled corticosteroid  (i also have asthma), and a daily saline spray to keep things in check and keep from suffering.\n\nBut hell. If that\'s the price to breathe, so worth it. And people can understand me! No one has said, ""Oh, you sound sick"" in the last two days yet!!!\n\nAlso, I BEAT THE ANTIHISTAMINE ADDICTION! All it took was switching from zyrtec to Claritin, and Claritin is easy to miss days of. If I miss a day of zyrtec, I itched like wildfire. Like fire ants were biting my while body. If I miss a Claritin- nothing!\n\n\nEdit: Thanks all for letting me rant, I just needed peoppe who\'ve experienced this to listen.\n\nThanks to those of you who suggested I need an ENT for the nasal polyps. I see him at the end of the month! We are getting there!\n\nAlso, the itching I\'m talking about when I stop taking Zyrtec isn\'t an allergy issue (that I know of). Zyrtec causes some strange sort of withdrawal for some people, where, regardless of exposure to allergies, about 24 hours after taking it, your entire body starts itching like crazy. So bad people can\'t help but scratch their skin open. It\'s known, but so far it looks like the medical companies haven\'t looked into it that I can find. So, while I appreciate the suggestions of staying at hotels, and the suggestions of having to suck it up and be sniffly, this is a strange withdrawal type thing, not an ""I\'m allergic to something"" thing. As far as I can tell, the Zyrtec doesn\'t do anything for my allergies anyway at this point. I just take it so I don\'t itch.\n\nSo, I\'m using another antihistamine right now, and that means I make it 16-20 hours before the itching starts. Hopefully by the time I\'m done with the ENT, I can stop taking the new antihistamine and see an allergist. \n\n-End edit-\n\n\nI have severe allergies. Environmental, indoor, dust mites, all of it. In the last 3 years (I\'m 31), it\'s suddenly gotten way worse. My regular doctor can\'t help me anymore than he has (Antihistamine, nasal steroid, Singulair, tried Benadryl, tried every allergy medicine that exists, had surgery to straighten my septum and reduce turbinates). So he suggested I see an allergist again. Cool, I would love not to feel like this every day.\n\nI can\'t breathe out of my nose. Ever. It\'s too congested. I have nasal polyps I can see in the mirror. Half the time, my sinuses are so clogged, I hear like I\'m underwater. My nose runs all night when I try to lay down.\n\nSo today I called to make the appointment with high expectations. They literally will not even talk to me because I can\'t stop taking antihistamines for 3 days. My body is addicted to the antihistamines. I would literally, seriously, rather die than deal with that extreme itching that comes with not taking an antihistamine. \n\nSo, I guess this is my life now. I\'ll just be that weird mouth breather. That\'s fine. No, don\'t worry that no one can understand me on the phone since I sound so congested. Everything is just fine.'"

When deciding on whether to move forward with surgery, I read about 100 of these, and most of them were pretty scary. Thought I\'d share my positive account.\n\nTLDR: MRI to surgery in about a month - So far, everything\'s going great!\n\nI\'ve had lower back pain as long as I can remember, was treated when I was 20 for it. So this could have all started as far back as then, but for the last three years I\'ve had severe flare-ups resulting in Urgent Care visits. Sciatic pain accompanied the lower back pain, mostly in the buttocks and hips. Flare-ups would happen once or twice a year and last one to two months. I was on a three-week bicycle tour in June of last year and the back pain was at a level of severity that I had not previously known. Still had to ride 80 mile days with 8k feet of climbing every day. Chocked it up to tight hamstrings (notoriously inflexible). When I went to the docs upon arriving back in the States, he also believed it to be tight hamstrings, but something wasn\'t quite right. I requested an MRI, he said no need, I urged, he ordered it. When the symptoms started resolving, as they usually had, I didn\'t schedule the MRI.\n\nEnd of November of 2019, another painful flare-up, the sciatica being worse this time, along with tingling in feet and testicles (though the tingling subsided with core exercises). I still had the MRI referral so I got it. Results: herniations at l4/l5 and l5/s1 - the former being enormous (14+mm). Severe spinal stenosis, DDD, the like. Not tight hamstrings. Primary physician said surgery likely because of how long I\'ve been having symptoms. First neurosurgeon visit, he scheduled me for Microdiscectomy / Hemilaminectomy / Facectomy. 2nd opinion said it was the right move. A neurosurgeon friend of a friend said ""Holy shit, you need surgery.""\n\nI felt surgery was necessary, but was terrified of surgical failure and having to eventually get a fusion. The pain and severity of the MRI findings eventually made my decision, and I went through with surgery on January 9th.\n\nArrived at the hospital, told them how sick I get under anesthesia. Whatever they gave me for the nausea worked - no nausea in the slightest, a first for me. Woke up after surgery with zero sciatic pain and I felt more aware then the two other times I\'ve been under. They wanted me walking right away, and I was home in bed before I knew it (less than two hours from waking up from surgery). Seemed crazy quick, but they must have it down pat.\n\nThe first few days were painful in the incision area. I was given only enough percocet for a day and a half. Put a call into the doc on Friday (day 1 post-op) and never heard back till the following Tuesday. They apologized for dropping the ball on this. After the perc ran out, I used Tylenol with codeine for a few days. I was up walking around the house a bunch on Day 1 post-op. Day 2 I took a really short walk around the block.\n\nDay 3 I walked a little bit more, and was surprised with how mobile I felt. By Day 5 I was walking two-three miles a day, which I\'ve kept up every day. Yesterday (Day 9) I walked 4.5 miles. I think this might have been pushing it, but I feel best when I\'m moving so decided to listen to my body.\n\nRecovery has been uneventful, and much easier than I anticipated based on other accounts. I\'ve had a few ""scares"" - bumping into furniture, some weird aches and pains here and there, scared I was getting a blood clot - but everything seems okay still.\n\nTomorrow I have my first follow up. My body is pretty stiff and I can\'t wait to start PT / begin stretching. Though I still have surgical pain, I believe my lower back pain was helped with the surgery as well (doc said it could go either way on that front). Will follow up on this as surgical pain diminishes. Still no sciatic pain AT ALL. A tiny bit of tingling in the feet here and there, but almost phantom-like.\n\nHappy to answer any questions and follow-up again if wanted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: A couple things that worked for me I thought I\'d share:\n\n* Using a sports bladder to drink water. This way, when you\'re laying down recovering, you can stay super hydrated. And it also makes you pee a ton, which is good for forcing you to get up and move every hour.\n* Kombucha / probiotics / psyllium husk in smoothies - keep that gut healthy! Poops have been great, no constipation at all. \n* Grabber device is super helpful. As is a Sock Aid - put on your own socks!\n* Toilet seat riser - 5 inch rise, made it very easy for the first week to use the toilet. \n* Have a wife. Lots of yummy meals and I got out of cleaning the first few days :) \n* Keep moving.'"

Do you guys think that I should jump into isotretinoin or give the antibiotic more time ? \nI'm asking because I read on internet that it effects my liver and kidney and its kinda scares me. Do you guys have a problem with it ? Do you guys have a regular check up while on it ?\nThank you"""

Every single one of them told me to see a primary care physician for medication; I did. I was prescribed Amoxicillin - Clavulanate 875-125 mg 2x a day for 10 days with 500 mg Naproxen. Today is day 3 of taking the antibiotics and pain has done nothing, but increase. I accepted one of the dental appointments I was offered by the 4 offices on April 28th.\n\nI have a few questions.\n\n1. How long should it take for the pain reduction from the Amox-clav to take effect? Day 3 and I've taken 5/20 of the 875-125mg pills and will take the 6th pill later tonight. The pain has done nothing, but increase keeping me awake, I wake up every 10-30 minutes when I doze off from pain. (i also received a shot of Toradol and something else 3 days ago).\n2. What is a good timeframe to realize the antibiotics might not be working and I should go back to see my Primary Care Physician since I can't get any Dentist or Endo to see me within a month?\n3. If the abscess pain ever leaves how long can I expect the infection to stay at bay before becoming painful again since my dental appt isn't until April 28th and nobody will squeeze me in for an emergency\n4. Also I've added on 650 extended release acetaminophen to my 500mg naproxen and it isn't touching this pain at all along with salt water rinses. Is there anything else I can do? This tooth has been RCT for 4 years and a few months.\n5. Should I be draining the abscess myself when it forms a fistula, I've done this twice in 2/3 days of taking my antibiotics. Since no dentist will see me for a month and I have a cheap dental mirror I'm able to look at the abscess, I first noticed the bleeding after brushing my teeth a week ago, then about 2 days later I realize I had pus draining from there.\n6. This is one of the only 2 teeth in my mouth that touch on bite and it SUCKS when I accidentally do it. Is there anyway I can mitigate this until April 28th?\n7. is this common practice to not have emergency dental visits since Covid because I feel so helpless right now after pleading to 4 different offices  how it is keeping me awake. (one of them I've called 2 different days since a week ago).This has really opened my eyes; I can actually see why people seek street medication outside of recreational use since you have to wait in misery for so freaking long even if you breakdown over the phone explaining your pain.\n\nI've never taken antibiotics for this, and the only time I could think maybe I had a form of antibiotic was during my Gallbladder Surgery exactly 1 year ago from yesterday if that is common practice while under surgery; I have no clue.\n\nThanks for any advice; April 28th feels like forever with this pain."""
acetaminophen problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/11k1hrq/diclofenacmedication_questions_and_advice_request/,b'Diclofenac/Medication Questions and Advice Request',,"b""Hi everyone.  I started having sciatica and joint problems in my right side beginning at the end of January. For the first 2-3 weeks I could barely walk (a 2 minute walk to the kitchen turned into 30min+!) but now it's at a tolerable point where I can walk short distances with a cane and do minor physical activities. I'm not sure what caused this. It feels like a mix of stabbing nerve pain, inflammation and aching in my joint. I's not related to my spine (had negative spinal Xrays in January before this) and I'm currently waiting for results on a hip Xray I took last week. I am also scheduled to start physical therapy in the next week. If that doesn't help my doctor is looking towards an MRI. (6 weeks of PT is for the insurance hoops for an MRI.)\n\nI was taking a lot of Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen every day for the first few weeks for the pain. Acetaminophen for the general pain and Ibuprofen for the pain and inflammation I could feel pulsing and stabbing in my side. I ended up developing Edema in my feet, ankles and lower calves from taking too much Ibuprofen (didn't know it could do that to you!) so I stopped the Ibuprofen. After the edema cleared up my doctor put me on Diclofenac DR (75mg x2/day) to help with the pain and inflammation I am getting/feeling around the joint in my right hip/leg. \n\n***My questions are if this is a pretty standard dose of Diclofenac or if this goes any higher, and if this is a medication that can be taken long term as a means of treatment? I was also wanting to see if there were any other recommendations for medications that would help (I'm already on an opioid medication so I'm not asking for opioid-related controlled substances!).*** I know Diclofenac is generally a strong NSAID and I've been told not to take any others (not really trusting Ibuprofen anymore, honestly. lol!).\n\nI'm only on Diclofenac for a few more days as it's temporary until I see my primary doctor on the 15th and would like to have an idea of the plan ahead and discuss this with her. I definitely think it helps, along with the other medication I'm taking (I can tell a difference with and without for comparison), but of course I'm trying to be optimistic and open as I've never experienced anything like this in my life. \n\nAnyway, sorry for somewhat ranting and giving too much extra details and whatnot lol.   \nThank you to anyone who reads and answers and good health to you all!

Do I regret it? Sort of?'",,"b'At the end of my course of Accutane in September 2018, I posted about it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/9dcvkx/accutane\\_journey\\_steatocystoma\\_multiplex\\_holy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/9dcvkx/accutane_journey_steatocystoma_multiplex_holy/)\n\nHere are my thoughts, 2 years later. **Please note that this is not an attempt to persuade or dissuade anyone from going on the tane. I just want to share my personal experience with it so you can add it to your collection of others\' stories and come to your own decision if you\'re still deciding or having second thoughts during your course.**\n\n# PROS:\n\n\\+ Much less acne in general, and preventing acne is a lot easier. My face isn\'t anywhere near as magical and silky smooth as it was during the course, but it\'s definitely better than before the tane. Also I can actually *put stuff* on my skin/face now without worrying as much about breaking out, like sunscreen or makeup!\n\n\\+ It pretty much *solved* my dandruff problem, which I realized I had because it would all get stuck inside what used to be my thick forest of hair (more on this in the cons), and it was almost impossible to clear out.\n\n\\+ Smoother upper arms, which used to be rough/bumpy with ""chicken skin"" (keratosis pilaris).\n\n\\+ I really don\'t need to shower every day anymore (lol) since I don\'t produce nearly as much oil as I used to, and I don\'t have to constantly wipe my faceI used to blot my face with blotting sheets or napkins (either of which would come out *translucent*) every few minutes only to have the oil come back a minute later. Now I can be in humid weather and not completely break out in acne all over my *entire* body  *that\'s* how oily my skin was before the tane. In fact my skin doesn\'t feel gross in humidity, it feels like it *thrives* in humidity! Sadly I live in San Francisco, which is dry af.\n\n\\+ No serious non-cosmetic health side effects yet, e.g., Crohn\'s, depression, suicidal thoughts, etc. I don\'t notice a difference in my joints but I do think about or worry about that sometimes \n\n# CONS:\n\n**HAIR**\n\nMy beautiful, strong, thick, dense, wavy, healthy hair is not the same. During the course I though it was a *bonus* because my hair was slightly thinner and less oily which made it perfect and more manageable. However, about a month after the end of my course, my hair started falling out in clumps. Every time I\'d run my hand through my hair I\'d lose a huge clump. Honestly if I didn\'t start off with ultra thick hairso thick that I would complain about how thick it was all the timeI\'m sure I would have ended up bald. My hair used to be much thicker than average and now it\'s sparser than average to the point where I can see a lot more scalp than I\'ve ever been used to seeing. On top of that, each *individual* follicle is thinner, and I also have this weird mix of ultra thin hairs, normal-thickness hairs, and every thickness in-between, which I didn\'t even know was possible.\n\nI felt so blessed with my natural pre-tane hair that people would be in complete disbelief when I told them I never put any styling products in my hair because it always just looked like it had product in it from being so naturally strong, wavy, and thick. All I had to do was comb it in the style I wanted after a shower and it would just naturally lock in to a beautiful quiff, as long as I controlled how much/little shampoo/conditioner I used. [No](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXdl5Y8jJVQ/) [hair](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYKNr0ODQFX/) [styling](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbBJzPojRIi/) [product](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdrKShqjYiG/) [in these photos](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfcVThZBETH/), I\'m dead serious. Now my hair feels like it falls out easier, can only tolerate shampoo \\*at most\\* once a week, and needs special hair masks/leave-in conditioner and styling product otherwise it looks super dry. I can\'t even get it wet with just water without needing to put coconut oil in after.\n\nHonestly I thought I would get over this and accept my new hair after some time, which is why I haven\'t posted about it for so long, or maybe I thought it would recover and gain some of its original form back. But here I am 2 years later, still mourning this change and I\'m still not over it. I know I\'m still blessed to have a good amount of hair and I\'m lucky and grateful the tane didn\'t seem to cause anything like Crohn\'s but I\'m still filled with regret about what it did to my hair, which is/was one of my absolute favorite things about myself. For those of you who might be experiencing the tane hair loss and wondering if it\'ll stop or if it\'s permanent, *for me* it stopped shedding at an alarming rate after 1 full year of falling out fast. Now it\'s shedding at what I think/hope is a normal/natural amount. Most of what fell out in that year seems like it\'ll never come back, but at least what I have left seems to be shedding/growing at a normal amount.\n\ntl;dr on the hair: My hair used to be   a m a z i n g   and now just needs a lot more care and products.\n\n**SKIN**\n\nI scar way easier, even on my face, and my skin is just not able to heal as well compared to before the tane. A lot of blemishes stay for much, much longer, and some of them look permanent. I actually have to moisturize now whereas before I never moisturized because it wouldn\'t do it anything but feel gross and/or make me break out.\n\nMy skin is a lot drier, forms creases more easily, and just doesn\'t feel nearly as elastic/supple as it used to beI seriously feel like my skin has aged like 8 years instead of the 2 that actually passed. I also joined the eczema club, which I never had before. I get it in anywhere, e.g., fingers, thighs, and the inner corner of my right eye :( but thankfully it\'s not *too* common and tends to be mild.\n\nMy lips used to have superpowers or something because they legit would *never* get chapped, not even when I went snowboarding or to the desert lol but now they\'re normal lips that can get dry sometimes. Not a huge change issue tbh. I\'ve never ever had to use chapsticks and I still don\'t really need them. The silver lining here is that my tane course taught me the magical ways of 100% lanolin nipple cream as the holy grail chapstick.\n\n**EYES**\n\nMy night vision is *terrible* now. It\'s noticeably and considerably worse, particularly if I\'m trying to make out edges/shapes of things when it\'s darkmy mind will try to fill in what\'s there but is usually wrong which is can be really quite jarring. Also lights have a noticeable halo around them but that\'s not a huge problem, just slightly annoying.\n\n**STEATOCYSTOMA MULTIPLEX**\n\nI have steatocystomas, which are just little, painless, hard bumps/sac that stay just under my skin, permanentlylargest one I\'ve ever had was the size of a penny in my cheek. It\'s a relatively rare skin condition and largely inherited as far as I\'m aware, so if you don\'t have them, don\'t worry about this. If you do, keep reading.\n\nWithin these 3 years during/after my course I\'ve had at least 4 incidents of new steatocystomas, 2 of which ruptured out of my skinwhich had never happened beforeand 3 of which ended in permanent scarring, whereas they used to never rupture out nor scar. What\'s interesting/strange is that they slowly grow and get red, itchy, painful, and super hot. My body runs really cold so it was quite a stark contrast.\n\nAn incident I wanted to highlight involved 2 red, painful lumps growing on my sternum. Peak size was about the size of an eyeball. My derm suggested corticosteroid injections, which caused it to explode when she did it (gross, and painful wtf). It did help immediately calm the swelling, but after it healed it left a scar/indentation which is still there, 2 years later, about the size of a pencil eraser. A new one appeared about a year after that one, this time on my upper/inner left thigh. I decided to let this one run its course naturally and it\'s been healing for several months. I\'m pretty sure it\'ll just leave a permanent dark area but hey at least there\'s not an indentation scar like last time! No change in my existing steatocystomas prior to the tane course, and there doesn\'t seem to be a change in frequency of new steatocystomas compared to before.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nAll in all, I felt like this is what I traded for going on the tane:\n\n* Thick/hard-to-manage but strong, beautiful hair that I loved  thin/weak hair that needs a lot of gentle care and products\n* Super oily face  dry/normal face and super dry rest of the body, skin is way less supple, felt like it aged a ton, gets wrinkles easier, scars easily, doesn\'t heal as well, and it can actually thrive in humid weather now and not break out if I put any products on it\n* Rough, bumpy upper arms  smoother upper arms\n* Normal, benign steatocystomas  aberrant, scarring steatocystomas that often hurt/itch when they appear\n\nIf I could go back in time and tell myself if I should go on the tane, what would I say? Honestly, I would probably tell myself: **no**. Granted, there are a lot of pros listed above, and a lot of the cons listed are not a huge deal, but given that new steatocystoma growth naturally declines with age and so does skin oiliness, combined with the fact that new cystic acne frequency declined steadily as I agedat that point I had no more cystic face acne, only cystic bacne every once in a blue moon, plus I\'d learned to deal with them pretty well already, and I only had bad face acne before collegeI think I was too hasty in my decision to go on the tane. If I\'m being honest, my super oily face was too big of a factor in making that decision, and it shouldn\'t have been. I had cystic acne, yes, but honestly in hindsight it wasn\'t severe enough to warrant everything else, so in the end it personally wasn\'t worth it for me. Someone else viewing my situation/story might think it *was* worth it and that\'s a fair opinion too, but personally I regret it.\n\nI do know, however, that out of the 5 or so friends I know who have done the tane, they had an overall very positive experience, with few or no adverse permanent side effects. Only a *single one* of them regretted it like me. So, again, I\'m not trying to dissuade anyone, but just know that there\'s a riskjust as with everything else in life. It\'s a small one which is why I do generally still encourage people to try it even if I regret it.\n\nAll I ask is that you be very careful with your dosage because even though higher doses (shorter time) decrease chance of remission, it\'s remission of the good *and* bad; plus they can increase the risk of adverse side effects. Not all derms know thisthey don\'t even know about nipple cream as lip balm (come on!! Accutane 101!)and mine certainly didn\'t and put me on a dose that I personally think was inappropriately high toward the end of my course.\n\nFinally, I wanted to talk about something I see a lot in this subreddit: please don\'t negate or diminish our stories. We\'re not being shady or making this up or trying to dissuade people. I just want to add my story, even if it\'s not as positive as most stories here. Thank you for reading this wall of text.'"

Gabapentin helps some, but that only addresses symptoms and not the cause.  How can I prop my foot up without causing a sciatica flare? \n\nApologies for a long story. That said  Anyone else here have sciatica stemming from having to sit with a foot propped up due to lower-extremity surgery? \n\nI (59F) had surgery on my left ankle approximately 4 weeks ago. I was instructed to be non-weight bearing for 4 weeks, and to keep my foot elevated as much as possible for at least a week, preferably 2, to help keep the swelling down. This was fine for the first few days, and then the trouble began. \n\nAfter surgery, my foot was almost completely numb for several days, which I was not concerned about due to the nerve block and/or swelling. As it gradually woke up, and as I sat and sat and sat (reclined with my foot propped up higher than my heart), I started to have an uncomfortable pulling feeling in my leg, and it got harder and harder to get comfortable. The worst was at night, trying to sleep. There were zero comfortable positions, and I started experiencing jolts/shocks in my foot that were awful and made me jump. I was exhausted.\n\nAt about the 1.5-week-post-surgery mark, I contacted the doctor about the continuing foot numbness and he prescribed a corticosteroid, presumably to reduce swelling (and thus pressure on the nerves that run through the ankle joint). Then when I went for my 2-week visit to get my stitches out, I told him I was struggling with the foot jolts/shocks, and he offered to prescribe Gabapentin. Initially I declined, since I have a neighbor who became suicidal on Gab, but I had a TERRIBLE night that night with the foot jolts and general discomfort in bed, so I called the next morning and asked for a RX. (Apparently hes not the most diligent Gab prescriber as he didnt ease me into the 1200 mg/day dose he wanted me on. Thankfully I read up on it and eased into 900 mg/day over a couple of days. 1200 is way more than I need, so Ive never taken the full dose).\n\nAt this point, having been on Gab for about 10 days, I am able to sleep well (in one position only but at least I have that!), and I am generally comfortable during the day so long as I take my daytime dose of Gab. If I try to do without it, the sciatica pain returns. Its definitely not the 10/10 that some of you experience, but its not great either, and it flares if I try to sit with my foot up, which of course Im supposed to keep doing.  Ive been doing the Big Three sciatica exercises to try to knock it down, but Im still struggling. Im thinking it might not calm down until I can actually walk on both feet again.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with a flare due to lower extremity surgery recovery? I do have a spine doc due to presumed SI joint pain (he took an X-ray and said everything looked normal, but I think I have hypermobility issues that cause pinching)  Should I be trying to get in and see him about this or wait and see? It is so distressing not to be able to do right by my poor ankle. Other than the exercises Im already doing, what else could I try?\n\nTIA.'"

Now I have some degenerative changes due to aging and what I believe is an injury due to weight lifting, which is spondylolisthesis of L4 slipping over L5.  \n\nAbout six months ago I started to experience a lot of pain while sitting up in bed.  That evolved into sciatica radiating down into both legs and I eventually went to the doctor for that.  She put me on a burst of prednisone, which was very effective, but when I was done with that the pain gradually returned.  Now it's changed and it's mostly right side.  \n\nHere is my problem.  I'm a musician and, though I'm retired from my day job, I have an active life with shows and rehearsals.  I have a show scheduled for this coming Saturday and have three rehearsals this week.  \n\nMy problem is that my sciatica comes back without warning and basically cripples me.  Yesterday I could not walk unless I was bent almost fully over and I could not bear any weight on my right leg at all.  It was so bad I ordered a pair of crutches so that I could get around without using that leg at all.  \n\nI had a rehearsal last night, and I have prednisone leftover here so I took that in 10mg increments until I hit a point of relief just so I could get through my obligations (40mg was the magic).  I know that I can't use prednisone every day but it is the only thing I've done so far that gets me functional.  I do have several different kinds of braces that I wear depending on where the pain seems to be radiating from but they don't always help. \n\nI texted my doctor yesterday; it's very hard to get an appointment with her, but she sent me to a nurse for two injections today; Toradol and decadron.  From what I gather, one is an NSAID and one is a steroid.  \n\nIn the meantime I've also been doing stretching and physical therapy, and I'm on 15 mg of meloxicam daily and also nortryptyline.  I don't think any of that is helping much.  \n\nI have an appointment with my doctor on Feb 2, not sure what I should be looking for in terms of next steps. This thing is utterly crippling when it comes on and I am not sure what I can do on my own to alleviate this.  I have thought about contacting a different doctor through telehealth to see about getting emergency prescriptions so that I have prednisone around for burst use when I just need to be functional over the short-term, like when I have a show.  I know the dangers; my career was in public health and I understand what it does to my immune system and my adrenal glands and not to use it daily.  But so far it's the only thing that's given me my life back long enough to get something done.  \n\nI guess I'm looking for any additional thoughts.  I'm so new to this.  I had no idea this could be so crippling and I feel so bad for everyone here who goes through it.  My heart goes out to you.  Thanks in advance for any help or thoughts you can offer."""

It was a six hour drive home (not an exaggeration) with medical transport and no meds or liquids.\n\nI was naturally exhausted when I got home, iced up, and went to bed. No meds because I have a sensitive stomach and wasnt touching a thing without food. Could barely swallow and kept choking on my spit. Peed like crazy despite being dehydrated out of my mind.\n\nStill barely eating and drinking today from the pain. Cant take NSAIDs because they cause major stomach issues. Bonus, cant easily take the prescribed opioids because I have IBS, which has already significantly worsened thanks to the Zofran I had twice during surgery (which I really did need, I nearly vomited when I came too). Am physically disabled and cannot just walk or drive to the store (I pretty much rely on Amazon, medical transport refuses to take me to the store) so any laxatives arent easily accessible. I have a lot of expensive needs that insurance wont cover, which is why I unfortunately dont just have them at home despite my IBS.\n\nI took 1/8th of a Medrol pill and Ive been tachycardic all day (Im sure the dehydration isnt helping). For some context, I have EXTREME, sometimes DANGEROUS reactions to MICRO doses of medications, even significantly below the prescribed dose.

They mentioned that the surgery went well, so Im not sure why the pain here is particularly bad. Anyway, earlier I had some cold juice from the fridge. Most of my mouth had no problem. Except the one spot where the tooth was removed in the lower right. The pain was insane; I couldnt talk or move my face. It radiated to my right eye and ear. I wondered if I needed to call 911, but I didnt know how because I couldnt say a word. When the pain started coming down enough for me to cry, well, I cried, and sobbed.\n\nCould this be dry socket, or a sign of it developing? Or could that particular spot just be having some severe cold sensitivity? :(**'"

Advil eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/y984qp/meds_have_finally_freed_my_social_anxiety_and/,b'Meds have finally freed my social anxiety and made me the person I always wanted to be!',,"b'Just wanted to share a success story for any college students struggling with social anxiety, burnout, and self doubt. Its a long read but I hope it helps someone out there get tested if they are on the fence about whether or not they have ADHD!\n\nLet me start by saying that I was diagnosed with ADHD At 10 years old but decided to gaslight myself into believing that I was misdiagnosed because I was a good student (I just couldnt sit still in elementary school). My parents put me on Concerta for a week and it made me so aggressive that I actually pushed my best friend (I would never ever hurt anyone). As a result, I avoided meds for the next 21 years of my life because of an irrational fear of being dependent on medicine that could turn me into a different person. I was so weird about meds that I even avoided pain meds like Advil and Tylenol.\n\nWhen it came to school, I always worked myself to the point of sickness and exhaustion just to get a B or A in my classes. I always thought I just needed to work harder than everyone, to the point where I was sick with a stress induced cold/flu every month! I was skipping class week after week because I barely even had time to sleep with how much I had to study to keep up. But I kept my grades high regardless. I thought maybe I had an autoimmune disorder, and that I would just have to live with sickness for my whole life. \n\nSocially, I always felt just slightly different from my peers. I like to think that I am incredibly personable and a great listener, but I always felt like I was stuck right between introverted and extroverted. I go through week long periods of recovery where I MUST be alone after a few days of intense social interaction. And sometimes I feel socially awkward out of nowhere and have a hard time speaking my thoughts coherently. My friends used to get upset that I would never reach out to them and always waited for them to make plans with me. When confronting them about how I feel and my insecurities, they always told me that it was just in my head because they love hanging out with me and chatting. As a result, I chocked my mood swings and recovery periods to manic depression and assumed I would just have to live with it forever. I told myself that I was just an introverted extrovert.\n\nThings continued like this for a while until this fall semester, the start of my senior year studying computer science at university. Something was not right. I was skipping half my classes and just couldnt get myself interested in the material. I was smoking daily to cope with a deep depression and stopped reaching out to people. I was just sick, lonely, and felt like a failure. I couldnt even get myself to go to the grocery store to buy food for myself. I hit rock bottom when I failed two midterms and realized that my dream of cum laude had vanished before my eyes.\n\nI decided to get retested by a psychologist and was once again was diagnosed with ADHD-C. I was scared and sad that something was wrong with my brain and didnt want to believe it. My doctor prescribed 10mg or adderall 1-2x/day for my school days and I was apprehensive given my past. I finally decided to just try it on one of my 8 hour school days and figured that if it made me feel weird I could just stop immediately.\n\nThat day literally changed my life forever. For the first time in my life, I could actually understand each word coming out of my professors mouth. It was crystal clear! I also felt this new, deep love for learning. I was fascinated by my classes and couldnt wait to watch YouTube videos on the content we were learning (yes, the very same classes just a week ago I was skipping). My restless legs stilled and I had no desire to fidget. No boredom, no sadness, no depression. Just a love for learning. It was the first time ever that I did not have to teach myself the content out of the textbook because I actually UNDERSTOOD the whole lecture!!\n\nAfter that first class, I had this uncontrollable urge to just speak to everyone and make so many new friends. I sent texts to old friends asking to hang out, filled up my weekend with plans, and started random conversations with people in my classes who I would NEVER talk to. I went from never reaching out to accidentally double or triple booking my nights with plans. I also got this weird feeling where I just want to tell everyone how amazing and beautiful they are are and call my family members to tell them I love them. So thats what I did, I called my mom and told her how lucky I am to have her in my life and texted my best friends letting them know I love them. This is SO unlike me, I NEVER reach out, I hate phone calls, and I have way too much anxiety to talk to strangers.\n\nThat full 8 hour day felt like a breeze. Normally, I would have come home and taken a nap, but instead I CHOSE to go to the grocery store after school! I cleaned my apartment and still had the energy to start my homework. \n\nIts been 2 weeks since that day and I have not missed a single class. Infact, for the first time in my life, I actually look forward to my longer school days. I start my homework on time, I reach out to friends, and my desire to smoke has disappeared. Ive even been going on dates again and have really been impressing boys with my new conversation skills. I am finally the person that I have always wanted to be. My fraternity friends say that I am a different person and that it is clear as day to them how much happier I am.  \n\nIf you are like me and felt socially awkward, or are working yourself to death, or are not taking care of your own health, PLEASE GO GET TESTED FOR ADHD. You do not need to live like this for the rest of your life. Thank you for hearing my story. If anyone else has had a similar experience (especially with social anxiety) I would love to hear and chat with you about it!'"
acetaminophen problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/xkvx3e/i_stopped_wearing_my_night_guard_when_i_got_a/,"b'I stopped wearing my night guard when I got a crown got put in. I started wearing it again 2 months ago, now Im in near constant pain and hot and cold sensitivity. Is this normal?'",,"b'Hi there - hope this post finds you well. \n\nTLDR; I had a crown put on my left buckle molar on March 16th. I went 3 months without wearing my night guard. Once the crown got sanded down, I started wearing it again about 2 months ago but now Im at the point where most nights I have to take 1200mg of acetaminophen to make the pain go away. Is this normal? \n\nI have 4 drinks/wk. non smoker. \n\nFull story:\n\nI noticed a few days after the crown was put in that my night guard no longer fit and my bite was off. I was bummed about the night guard not fitting because I grind my teeth at night. Not wearing it led to sensitivity and a sore jaw. But life got in the way and I wasnt able to make a follow up appointment till July 14th. \n\n\nOn July 14th, my dentist sanded down the crown and my bite started feeling better. I got my night guard from a different office so my dentist didnt know what kind I had. I scheduled another visit for July 28th. The visit was quick as he confirmed I could change the shape by running it under hot water. \n\n\nHe advised that Id feel some soreness for the first month because the night guard was going to move my teeth back to their original position (pre-crown). Well, pretty fast I had heat/cold sensitivity. It was painfully sensitive. That was my only symptom for the first month. Now the sensitivity is constant but the intensity tends to be less. I just try not to aggravate it throughout the day.  Sometimes pain radiates from it at night, or from the tooth in front of it, under it, and sometimes opposite it (right rear molar). The pain is getting hard to ignore at night and doesnt go away unless I take 1200mg of acetaminophen. But my jaw isnt sore anymore so, yay?\n\n\nIm avoiding going back to my dentist office because theyre going to charge me another $20 for an exam. And I feel this is mostly my fault for not wearing my night guard and delaying my appointments. Ive never had braces so I dont know if this is the same pain as teeth moving. \n\n\nTime recap:\n\n\n- Pre-March 16th: in love with my night guard, no problems \n\n\n\n- March 16th: crown put in\n\n\n- March 17: stopped using night guard bc no longer fit \n\n\n- July 14th: crown sanded down \n\n\n- July 28th: started using night guard again\n\n\n- July 29th: pain started\n\n\n- Sept. 15th: have to take 1200mg at night, every other night \n\n\nThank you for any insight!!'"

Feel free to skip over my rant and just jump to the end to offer advice. \n\nSo my common law husband has found out he's got cancer on his nose and needs surgery to remove it and do cosmetic repairs afterwards The surgery is in another province (we're in Canada) as it would take too long to see a surgeon here.  It's scheduled for April 10th.  It is an 7-8 hour drive if the weather is good. It is steep mountain passes and winding canyon road for about 2  hours of it so it could be longer if snowy. And I'll be doing the driving on my own for the return trip.  There's also a chance we'd have to go again a few weeks later to do follow up.  \n\nI'm struggling with sitting as it is, and lately walking has also become a problem.  \n\nBegin rant: Relationship wise we're also struggling (have been for a long time but hes probably unaware), because I've always been the bottom of his priority list behind his job and his grown-ass daughter. I know it's my fault for not sticking up for myself (the rest of my family has also taken advantage of me so he's not unique). \n\nFor context (feel free to skip this part):  When I was first hurt he left me at the hospital and wouldn't come back for me, I had to wake up my son who'd just come off a graveyard shift and lives a half hour away to come get me, because husband was too busy with work. Yet just a few months prior he had a gallbladder surgery and I left work to take him and stayed til they wheeled him in, and made sure I was back before they brought him back.  And early in our relationship I had to have surgery to get my tubes tied because I couldnt take birth control anymore, it was giving me severe migraines and my doc was afraid I'd  have a stroke. He refused to have a much easier vasectomy.  He also didnt want my kids calling him dad. And he's not been terribly supportive in helping me around the house either since ive been hurt (not even while he was laid off for the winter) I continued to shovel snow, sand the driveway, carry in wood for heat, clean the house, etc. So yeah, I'm not that important,  but when the tables are turned I'm always there for him, and I will be this time too. I do love him still regardless.  \n\nThere is another option.  An airport an hour away. The flight is only 45 minutes to the town we need to get to.  But he doesn't want to fly because his face will be all bandaged up.  I can truly understand this and sympathize with him, but if he were in pain I would be willing to fly for him even if I felt uncomfortable and self conscious. Heck, I'm sure he'd get all kinds of sympathy from the flight crew.  I just know if the tables were turned he would not drive me.  Hell, he probably wouldn't even go with me because it would mean missing work.\n\nSo all my emotional bagage and feeling sorry for myself aside, can anyone give me some advice on how to endure the drive? I can take pain meds for the drive there (I have opioids) as he'll be helping with the driving, but on the way back I can't take anything, and he's not going to want to stop anywhere public either.  I plan on taking some ice packs, some hot patches and some pain meds for when I'm not driving.  Tylenol and NSAIDs do nothing for me. I've tried half a dozen different useless cushions. What else can I do to make this less painful, or are there any pain meds that won't make me drowsy or high?  I am really hoping it won't be as bad as I think but I want to prepare for the worst."""

I told him not to abuse medicine needed by others.  He said need is simply perception.  Here is my response.\n\nADHD is just as real as pain, both on a perceptual and a chemical level.  Every person diagnosed with ADHD has a different perception and tolerance level, much the same as everyone suffering from pain has a different perception and tolerance to the pain they are experiencing.  \n\nPain is caused by prostaglandins, the chemical responsible for both swelling and signaling to the brain that there is something wrong.  NSAIDs, the most popular category of OTC pain killers, stop pain and swelling by limiting the effect that prostaglandins have on the body.  Opiates act on several bases to alleviate pain.  They primarily act upon the Mu receptors, reducing the flow of painful stimulants.  They also act upon the limbic pathways, reducing the emotional response to pain.\n\nADHD is caused by a lack of neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) in the brain.  The brain of a person with ADHD is always in a constant state of desire for these neurotransmitters, exhibited by restlessness and distraction.  These constant external stimuli stimulate the brain to release a small amount of these neurotransmitters.  When one takes a stimulant (amphetamine, methylphenidate, cocaine, etc.), the brain either releases these neurotransmitters or blocks their reuptake, or both.  The more is taken, the more neurotransmitters are released.  When one with ADHD takes a stimulant, their levels of neurotransmitters rise to a level in which the brain is no longer in need of an external stimuli.  This allows for the person to function as a normal person.\n\n\nI won, though, sadly, he deleted his post.'"

acetaminophen problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/nyqtxz/i_have_a_history_of_dry_sockets_i_did_everything/,"b'I have a history of dry sockets. I did everything PERFECTLY this time, but Im waking up in the middle of the night on day 3 with excruciating pain. Is it a dry socket and how is that possible?'",Image496,"b'As said in the title, I have a history of dry sockets. Out of the 7 previous teeth Ive had pulled, 4 have ended up with dry sockets (one of them was even an upper, which I know is not common). And here is possibly number 5 out of 8. \nIn addition to all those dry sockets, my first ever extraction experience led me to 6 weeks of incredible pain at the age of 22 due to osteomyelitis. \nSo needless to say, I have been terrified to get this most recent needed extraction (failed root canal). I planned it all out for months. My husband took time off of work to take care of the kids (and me), I quit smoking last October but just quit vaping 2 days before the procedure. I havent had a drop of alcohol. I have only eaten soft food (soup, yogurt, pudding and applesauce). I have been sleeping with my mouth open (since I clench at night, I usually create a vacuum in my mouth so I figured that might be the problem). I have done everything right. AND the blood clot is still in place from what I can tell. This pain is throbbing, and it seems to have progressively gotten worse after day one. Both ears feel like they are being pulled down, like a ton of pressure- but that started day one. My jaw now feels like its throbbing pain, and while the meds seem to help, its only for about an hour. The pain is much worse upon waking up just now, which is 6 hours after my last dose of hydrocodone/acetaminophen. That was the second time I took that kind, and I got super nauseous so I wont be taking that again. Other than that Ive been alternating ibuprofen and Tylenol, but I take one, it takes an hour to kick in, and then the pain relief is already fading an hour and a half later. \nMy question is, could this be a dry socket even if the blood clot was not disturbed? My oral surgeon put me on a course of z-pack, but could this instead be an infection?\nI plan to call in the morning, but Im just dumbfounded. \n\nMore in depth history: My lower wisdom tooth removal turned dry socket and then turned osteomyelitis on one side. The oral surgeon had no idea what was happening. He pulled out a piece of bone thinking that may have been the cause of the pain. Then he ended up pulling the tooth in front of that extraction site which had been a successful root canal. (Surprisingly I did NOT get a dry socket that time - the only lower tooth extraction to not end with a dry socket). Then he gave up and referred me to a different oral surgeon - who took one look and said osteomyelitis, put me on vioxx and some strong antibiotic and I was better in a week.'"

She can have rapid mood swings where she stops making logical sense, then she ends up crying and hitting herself in the head. A couple months back, she made an attempt on her life with headache meds (I believe it was something like acetaminophen), which sent her to the hospital. She passed the hospital off as a sudden heart problem, but I still figured it out. Her boyfriend is extremely reasonable, but his responses to when shes in a bad place can trigger her even more. It seems that this may have been a life long mental health issue, but Im not sure. She has been twice divorced (once to my dad), and has struggled with relationships for as long as I can remember. I spend most of my time at my dads house, due to the custody agreement, and this problem has been mostly hidden until now. She has seen therapists and is taking medication, but the medication doesnt seem to be working. She usually smokes pot until she passes out. Im worried her boyfriend will move out and she will get worse. My (23M) brother used to live with us and he knew all about her problem, but moved out a couple months ago. She has told me that she wouldnt really take her life because of my brother and I, but Im not sure if I believe her. I dont know what to do, whether to tell my Dad or not, because if I do he may just have me stop coming to her apartment which could push her over the edge. Should get help for her or what? Any advice?'"
codeine swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/868njb/sinus_surgery_experiencekeeping_myself_sane/,b'Sinus surgery experienceKeeping myself sane',,"b""So Im day 3 post-sinus surgery. Got a septoplasty, balloon sinoplasty, turbinate coblation, and some sinus ethmoidectomy (not sure of the name on this one.) \n\nIm writing down my experiences for the benefit of anyone else and to remember it all by. \n\nWhat made me get the surgery? \n\nMy experiences were strange, and likely either due to my lack of insight into my own body or just a really slow, steady worsening of symptoms, it took me forever to figure out I had allergies. The very first symptom I noticed as a young child was post-nasal drip. I asked my mother if it was normal to be constantly swallowing mucous. Of course, honey, she replied, as she also had a deviated septum and horrific sinuses from years of smoking. It was shocking to me to learn, years later, that not everyone has a choking fit on their own secretions several times a month. \n\nCut to me, age 24ish. I start noticing a strange gagging sensation after eating. I suspected some form of strange growth, or throat cancer (my grandfather had it) but also reassured myself that if it were a structural problem it wouldnt be so closely tied to eating. This symptom continued and grew worse and worse over the years. It was especially bad when I had a cold, or ate something spicy that would trigger my nose running. I would end up dry heaving because I gagged so hard. Around this time, as it worsened, I had gotten two cats and moved out of the city into a very wooded environment. It never occurred to me that this might be allergies, though, because I never thought of myself as an allergic person. \n\nEventually I began noticing my appetite was completely vanishing.  This was not an EDI wanted to eat, but the gagging made food unenjoyable. On top of it all, my food began to taste bland. I went through a phase of preferring intensely spicy food and very salty food before that, too, began to taste somewhat bland, like someone had thrown a filter over my tastebuds. I got dangerously underweight because I never wanted food, to the point where my underweight status triggered heart palpitations. \n\nThis was a wake up call. I needed to eat more, but the gagging was a real problem. I needed to figure out what was causing it. I got an endoscopy before being told it wasnt reflux. They ruled out gallbladder issues and a swallowing problem. Finally, I saw an ENT and an allergist. \n\nI had swollen sinuses and a deviated septum. On top of that, I was allergic to cats, birch trees, dust mites and dogs. \n\nNow things were starting to make sense. I started on zyrtec every dayand it did help. I gained ten pounds back.  But the gagging was still annoying, and food still tasted bland. I tried Montelukast, which made my sinuses bleed, and a spray for rhinitis, which made them bleed more, so I stopped taking the medicines. Eventually it got to the point where I was constantly swallowing blood from my sinuses. It was winter, so I thought this was likely normal, but I did mention it to my ENT. When he heard that, he suggested a CT scan. \n\nMy ENT called me the day of the scan. My CT showed some intense swelling, and after going through a few appointments and one second opinion, I decided to go through with the surgery. It may seem like Im downplaying some of these symptoms, but if there was even a remote chance that the surgery was going to stop the gagging during meals, I was all for it. Further opened airways would be a bonus. But the gagging was seriously affecting my QOL. \n\n\tSo, that was why I got the surgery. The surgery so far has beenan experience. \n\nDay 1: Im a nervous wreck going in, and my procedure was at 7:30 AM. They gave me a scopolamine patch to prevent any post op nausea (Ive never had post op nausea before, but I guess they wanted to be safe) and the actual procedure itself was fairly easysleep, wake up after a dream about zebras, and Im in recovery. My doctor doesnt use packing. This was interestingI had a drip pad, but I could breath through my nose. Air felt nice, though my right sinus, likely the side of the corrected deviation, wasnt quite as open as the left. I did notice that any post-nasal secretions dripped right down rather than getting stucka good sign, I hope, and one that I hope means that once all this swelling is gone the gagging will be a thing of the past. I talked to the medical student, who told me that ultimately I will feel even better than I do now, but that the next few days thing will get much worse. Ominous. I took one dose of Tylenol with codeine for pain, and then headed home. I was given antibiotics, Tylenol with codeine, Zofran, and some Neilmed. All the medicines were in liquid or dissolvable form since I cant swallow pills with my gagging issues.\n\nThat brings me to the rest of the day. The most annoying symptom day 1 was the dripping. I wore my drip pad over my nostrils all day, and for good reason, because the blood dripped out at the rate of about one pad every two hours. By the evening, unfortunately, the swelling began. I took off the scopolamine patch at this point, too, as I suspect it was giving me annoying side effects (pain urinating). Also, withdrawal from scopolamine patches is supposed to be hellish and I didn't want to risk it. \n\nI slept in a recliner, and got very little sleep. I would wake up whenever I felt any dripping, not to mention that my two cats enjoyed running around all night. And by the morning, the swelling was completeI was completely and utterly blocked, only able to breath through my mouth. The one silver lining was that there was no pain. I havent needed any painkillers since the first half hour after waking up from the surgery.\n\nDay 2: Total congestion in the morning. Eating and drinking was hellish with such a blocked nose. I had no sense of taste, but I managed a boost protein drink through a straw. By the afternoon, though, the act of putting my lips around a straw would cause the gagging sensation again. Seems I wont be free of it until all of this swelling is down. I was supposed to see my doctor for my post op on day 3, but I rescheduled to Day 2 because of the weather. \n\nThe cleanout was painful. The pain is like getting your legs waxed, but on the inside of your nosesuperficial pain to be sure, but pain.  Luckily, my ENT did it really fast. The doc also spritzed some decongestant in there and sent me home with a prescription for prednisone to help with the swelling. For about three hours I was breathing manageably through my nose, although not well. I started sinus rinses, but all that really means with such blockage is shooting up some saline and watching it drip back out. \n\nDinner was horrible. Unable to breath my nose, I had to chew with my mouth open, and I would get out of breath trying to eat pasta and not choke at the same time. Afterward I felt horrifically shitty and had another gagging session, after which I felt better. All of this was coupled with some intense anxiety brought on by the very claustrophobic feeling of intense sinus pressure and not being able to breathe through my nose. I took a Xanax to help me sleep.\n\nDay 3: Woke up 100% blocked, but I did sleep better than the night before despite waking myself up with snoring at times. I took the prednisone first thing in the morning. My sense of taste came back just enough to let me know how godawful disgusting that stuff tastes. I also discovered my antibiotics taste like strawberry and were actually rather tasty. I ate a protein drink for breakfast and a bit of bread at lunch. My appetite was non-existent. \n\nThe prednisone didnt do much. I still felt very blocked most the day. I kept trying to use sinuses rinses, but they didnt do much either. By dinner, I was anxious and miserable again, and kind of off-feeling. The gagging had returned too. I felt hot, incredibly anxious, and after I ate (or in this case, drank a protein drink) I was nauseous as hell. I took a Zofran and an hour later when that did nothing, a Xanax. Im not sure why I felt so horribly shitty in the evening, but I suspect the prednisone. I likely wont take it tomorrow. \n\nDay 4: Lots of draining while I slept. I woke up very bloody and uncomfortable, but improved from there after a hot shower. I took a zyrtec in the morning instead of the prednisone. Lots of improvement today--still very blocked and horribly congested, and eating is still tough, but the gagging sensation wasn't as intense today. I had more of an appetite and didn't need xanax around dinner time. Right now it feels like a horribly bad cold, albeit one with intermittent pain if I touch my nose wrong. I also still haven't quite mastered the sinus rinse technique. My right sinus still feels 100% blocked but my left is showing hopeful signs of allowing air through soon. \n\nDay 5: Day 5I decided to sleep flatter the night before, since I have a very painful muscle cramp in my neck from sleeping in recliners/combinations of pillows. Its isolated to one spot and Im too much of a wimp to massage it out. I woke up very congested, but there was far less bleeding and drainage. I felt very blocked until I did a sinus rinsethe rinse still isnt getting through one nostril and out the other the way I think its supposed to, but it did unblock me for a few hours. My right sinus got some air, but there was some burning pain with it, so I think it still needs some time to recover.  I also think Neilmed is putting a weird taste in my mouth/sinuses. That or theres some congealing gunk. Just four days until my next cleanout\n\nI felt well enough in the afternoon to eat a chocolate egg along with my boost protein drink. Getting close to Easter, after all! In less fun news, I do think the pressure of the swelling is affecting my vision a tiny smidgenin white rooms I see a lot more floaters and random visual noise. I had a lot of that before the surgery too, though. \n\nThe evening has been hell. The weird taste is unpleasant, and I made the mistake of eating a hefty few slices of pizza for dinner that I dont think my stomach could handle well. Ive got some GI issues too, maybe due to the antibiotics. The slight nausea catapulted me into a really intense panic attack, and not even my usual dose of Xanax has alleviated it. I hope tomorrow is better. \n\nDay 6: A better day. I'm still waking up with bloody crusties, but not as bad. My sinuses are sometimes blocked, but also sometimes open, though they never seem to both be open at the same time. I'm still getting weird tastes and drainage (The drainage is what causes the gagging sensation, and I hate it), and when one sinus is open I'm getting some pain in it--similar to the pain when you get water up your nose. All normal stuff, I imagine. I'm fairly certain there are some large icky boogers up there that I can't get rid of, and rinsing doesn't dislodge. Just 3 days until next cleanout... \n\nAlso, my sense of taste has definitely changed. I'm eating easy food to baby my stomach while I'm on antibiotics for the last few days, and chicken flavored ramen is GOOD. I liked it before, but now it's richer, if that makes sense? When this is all over I'm gonna have to re-try a lot of foods. I'm also craving the spicy food I used to like, but I know better than to try for that right now. I'm a bit excited though--I'm getting the sense that smells and tastes have bouquets to them that I was missing before. Maybe I'll even try and enjoy wine one day, which always just tasted like gasoline to me before. Of course, I'm sure I have several more days (weeks?) of recovery ahead of me before I'm 100%. \n\nDay 7: Close to Day 6. Slight improvements in the airway being open, though I can still there's swelling and general unpleasantness stuck up there. As the air way opens further, though, the draining is getting intense. A ton of stuff is dripping down, and I was incredibly nauseous in the evening to the point where I just went to bed early. Hopefully the draining will ease up over the next few days, or after the cleanout. I just want to be normal...\n\nDay 8: Fucking awful day. The nausea from last night lasted most of the day. I tried to get to work today, but felt so miserable that I left after two hours.  All I was able to stomach was white bread. The drainage is causing some bad gagging and nausea, I think. I took a zyrtec around noon to dry to dry up the drainage, and just laid down for hours. Oddly enough, by dinnertime the nausea started to fade and I was able to eat toast and some bacon. \n\nDay 9: 100% Better nausea wise. No idea what yesterday was about--was I swallowing some infected or nasty drainage? Did I pick up a stomach bug that caused just nausea and not any diarrhea or vomiting? It was bizarre. But today I feel mostly better. I'm still slightly congested, but its only slightly worse than it was before surgery. I have minor pinching pain in my nostrils, likely where the sutures are. But it finally feels like I'm on the mend. \n\nNow, I don't feel BETTER than I did before surgery, but I can assume that if I feel mostly like I did before surgery on day 9, then full recovery will take me into the world of healthy sinuses, right? I'll keep you all posted. And tomorrow, finally, is my cleanout! \n\nDay 10: Cleanout! It was first thing in the morning, and it helped immensely. My left sinus was totally 100% open most of the day, though it didn't feel as open in the evening/nighttime--but I can breathe through it no problem. The right side is still a bit swollen--the doc mentioned that it was the side where they went in for the septum straightening, so it may take a week or two to go completely back to normal. \n\nThere's so much air through my nose now it feels weird. I'm sure I'll get used to it soon. There's still some residual pinching pain, especially on the right, but things are looking good! I'll probably post less often, unless something crazy happens. Next cleanout is in two weeks--I'll be sure to update on the long term outcomes. Full recovery can take a while, after all. \n\nDay 14: Two weeks out \n\nI'm doing quite well. Very little bleeding (I did make the mistake of sticking my finger in my nose to see how things were doing and triggered some oozing, but that was all) and I'm getting lots of air, especially through my left nostril. The right is still a tad swollen, though not enough to block airflow appreciably, and I am getting lots of thick post nasal drip still, which is annoying. The primary reason for the surgery was to alleviate the gagging from PND, but I'm not sure if it will work for that. We'll see in a month or two, I suppose.\n\nMy only worry is I'm certain I still have allergies, and it might render the turbinate coblation less helpful (as allergies will make the turbinates swell right back up over time). But right now, despite not being 100% healed, I'm feeling pretty darn good. I'm still noticing the nasal cycle, but much less so. \n\nThe only other remaining annoyance is the remaining sutures--I think they're making the very front of my nose the teeniest bit swollen and sore. But its so minor I barely notice it.\n\nAnd thats how Im doing so far. Ill edit the post and add in more days as they go by.\n"""
codeine swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/8d3eax/allergic_to_dust_and_dust_mites/,b'Allergic to dust and dust mites',,"b'I had a prick test done a year ago and results showed I was mildly allergic to dust and dust mites. Just yesterday I was wearing a mask as I had the flu and I work in a private hospital as a student nurse. I took the mask off and just as I was about to go home my back first, and then face broke out in large hives and started itching swelling and spreading to my arms and neck, the doctor on our ward gave me phenargen 10mg and I was sent to ED. The doctor at ED could not figure out what my reaction was caused by even though I told him everything I had eaten and come into contact with, he spoke to me in a condescending way and even called me a child, saying its probably my make up (Ive worn the same makeup for years). I tried to explain I was wearing this mask all day but he just disregarded it and said you can only have allergies to latex gloves, never did I say I was allergic to the mask. He just gave me 50mg of phenargen and I was later discharged after the swelling calmed down.  I think my reaction was from the air filtering of the mask causing me to breath clean air all day and once I took it off the sudden amount of dust caused this huge reaction. Is that possible? If its not my mild allergy to dust, the only things I had that day were seafood and rice, which I had the night before and Im not allergic to. And the same morning tea I eat each day. Aswell as some cold and flu medication I had the day before this happened and on the same day (paracetamol and codeine mixed sinus meds).'"
NSAID swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/10mcfzx/extraction_pain/,b'Extraction PAIN',,"b'I had an extraction for a broken molar, second from back on the bottom left.

I thought it was food and tried to (gently) remove it with tweezers, seems it was tissue so I quit after some quick, strong jabbing pain. I have the tendency to grind my teeth and the extraction has made the urge stronger. Its the only thing that eases the pain, if only for a moment. Chasing the dental dragon. Ive noticed swelling so wonder if its infection vs dry socket. Dont want to go back to the dentist, they did me a favor by getting me in quickly at a reasonable price the first go-around as a new patient without insurance. Trying honey, it hurts also. Lots of nsaids after running through my norcos. Doesnt do a lot but help get me to sleep for an hour at a time. The pain never alleviated after extraction, they yanked on it, tore gums and twisted it all about but the numbing did its job during procedure and a few hours after. The pain has consistently existed but did get worse on day two, and worse each day since. My socket was never full of blood but I think I may have left the gauze in too long after extraction. It was always wet & I switched it out but intrinsically felt that the longer the better. I dont see bone but the coagulation is no where near the top of the socket. The covering went from white to white with green specks, lining the bottom of the socket. Will this resolve on its own if I can grit through the pain?

After taking 2 extra-strength Advil pills and sleeping for 3 hours, the headache was gone. However, for the next 24 hours I felt DRUNK.

I'm extremely stiff, I can't bend without a lot of effort, and walking is painful and difficult because of the pain and stiffness. It feels like it's inside my hip bones. I'm also gassy and very nauseas, especially when standing up. My hips now hurt and burn, both sides.\n\n   I have hypermobile joints, tmj (jaw problem), adhd. I am on tetracycline, elvanse (I think it's aduvanz outside my country) and lyrica.\n\n   I'm scared. I will see a doc tomorrow, but I'm scared"""

Apparently my desk was so cluttered that he demanded I clean itwhile the classroom of students and he, visibly irritated, sat and watched. Embarrassed, I began cleaning the papers out of my desk like I was told. Mr Brown added snide remarks the whole time to get me to hurry. Tell her to hurry up! he instructed another student, and then directly to me he snarled By the way, how did your Mom like her Mothers Day card? (a sarcastic reference to the card still being in my desk). \n\nI was humiliated, and without the knowledge of my ADHD symptoms and corresponding vocabulary, I couldnt explain this humiliation to myself other than being my own fault. I didnt tell anyone because my only logical conclusion was that I *deserved to be humiliated.* I had forgotten the Mothers Day card for Gods sakes. \n\nEven with all the neurological information, its a struggle to navigate positive self-worth.

NSAID swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/13yykdy/update_sudden_attack_while_traveling_abroad/,b'Update: sudden attack while traveling abroad',,"b'See my post history for info.  I wanted to update my case since its not such a dire one and is resolving relatively quickly. \n\nSo I got back to the US on Monday and saw my primary care doc today. She confirmed that it is sciatica (technically lumbar radiculopathy) and that its almost certainly not a spinal issue in my case, given my age (57) and history. More likely swelling from a pulled muscle in my lower back.  Either from sleeping in the weird hotel bed or washing a bunch of travel laundry in the hotel bath the previous evening. Apparently ruptured discs and other disasters are more common in the younger folks, who knew?\n\nIts already miles better, 10 days out, especially sleeping in my own bed.  I still have some achiness and a little numbness. I also pulled a muscle in the calf of my opposite leg, likely from all the limping. So that sucked. \n\nThe doctor I saw in Amsterdam gave me prescription strength NSAIDs and Valium to sleep. Ive now graduated to OTC ibuprofen and a muscle relaxant for nighttime. \n\nRiding a bike was probably the only thing I could do without pain. I still managed to hobble at least 5 miles or so a day on the vacation. \n\nAt its worst, I would put the pain at 7-8/10. Ive had a baby without epidural and would put the pain and cramping feeling right up there with advanced labor contractions. Now its at about a 2/10 and entirely manageable. \n\nIm to do some specific exercises, use ice and heat, take ibuprofen, and if it isnt resolved in a few weeks, Ill get PT.  If it worsens, then scans are in order. \n\nSo, not every case is a massive injury, and some can resolve in a couple weeks. There may be hope. Hang in there.'"

Now constant throat clearing of white phlegm. Any Help Greatly Appreciated',,"b' \n\nI am 20 years old, male, 55 and 165 lbs. live in the US. I had Covid around 5 months ago, although I dont know if its related.\n\nSo for as long as I can remember I would wake up, hack up a thick yellow wad of phlegm, and then go about my day. Sometimes I dont even have to force it out or anything and it just comes right up when I sit up. Fast forwarding to today, I am realizing that this isnt very normal but it never impacted my quality of life.\n\nI have been a mouth breather for most of my life and am trying to quit. The only allergies I have been aware of is penicillin but I think I may have developed more?\n\nNow, the thing that is truly causing me concern and anxiety is that after coughing up this yellow phlegm, I am CONSTANTLY either coughing up, swallowing, or clearing this thick white phlegm from my throat all day. It feels as if its being produced 24/7. It seems to stick to everything. There was even a period of time where my voice was very hoarse due to the throat clearing. I have tried many many things such as\n\n* Zyrtec (did nothing)\n* 3 weeks of a steroid inhaler (doctor suspected asthma but I have never had asthma)\n* NAC supplement (did nothing)\n* Cardio every day for two weeks (felt awesome but never solved the issue)\n* Drinking tons of water\n* not eating 3 hours before bed\n* Z Pack antibiotic for a week\n* Two week course of Omeprazole\n\nNow I am currently trying\n\n* fluticasone spray (morning and night)\n* fexofenadine tablet (every night)\n* Mucinex 1200 mg (every morning)\n\nDay 5 of this routine and there has been no notable change.\n\nChewing gum is one of the only things that provides relief if Im chewing it all the time.\n\nEating food also provides temporary relief until Im done eating, sometimes it feels worse after eating.\n\nHere is a list of all my symptoms *Note: all of these became present after Covid around August of 2022*\n\n* Constant globus sensation in throat\n* Constant phlegm production in throat (thick and white with bubbles)\n* Chest pain (costochondritis?) upon certain movements. Not when breathing\n* Occasional cough. Most coughing is me trying to force mucus out.\n* Sometimes I have a wheeze when breathing out while laying down. This can go away once I cough (due to mucus?)\n* Random stinging sensation in throat\n* left eye twitching (probably stress)\n* dry feeling eyes\n* Never feeling like I sleep well but I still have energy during the day (very strange)\n\nAlso, I keep trying to force a hard exhale to check if Im wheezing, but I feel like this is only making things worse. Should I stop?\n\nThank you so much for any insight. Im a Junior in college and this is by far the worst semester mainly due to anxiety about this. I feel like its really hurting my mental health.\n\nI keep googling and seeing bronchiectasis as a cause but I have never coughed blood and I never feel like the phlegm is from my lungs (but I also cant tell). I just REALLY hope it isnt bronchiectasis\n\nI have a spirometry in a couple weeks so hopefully that turns out good\n\nEveryone have a great day!'"

Multiple dermatologists have been seen  (1) cause completely unknown, (2) trigger unknown, and (3) treatments have been mostly unsuccessful.\n\nItching without rash was originally **mild** and **localized** ONLY to the groin and neck prior to March 2023. Itching has slowly expanded to the rest of the body and become more severe; see provided diagrams for details.\n\nAs of March 2023 itching became so severe it caused the patient difficulty with sleeping.\n\nSymptoms are cyclical  loosely on a weekly cycle. For example, itching can be mild (3/10) for 2-4 days, then severe (7/10) for 2-4 days.\n\nThere has never been a greater than 24 hour period with no symptoms, i.e. there is always some level of itchiness.\n\nA large amount of blood work was done showing no abnormalities.\n\nNo/minimal relief has been achieved with antihistamines, corticosteroid (oral/topical), and immunosuppressants (oral/topical). Some relief achieved with PredniSONE  but cannot be used long-term.\n\nTopical antibiotics and antifungals have been unsuccessful.\n\nPartial skin peel with 50% Glycolic Acid attempted in April of 2023. Relieved itching immediately. Long term effectiveness currently unknown. Itch appears to be slowly coming back.\n\nAllergist refused to see patient  stating condition was not an allergy due to localization.\n\nProceeding with more experimental treatment: (1) skin peels, (2) injections, and (3) dietary changes for minute allergies.\n\n# Lab Results:\n\nAll STD tests have come back negative. A full panel of blood tests was done to test for vitamin deficiencies, immunity issues, and viral infections  all came back normal; see lab results for more details.\n\nAn allergen patch test came back strongly positive for nickel and weakly positive for formaldehyde. Results are likely unrelated  as 10%+ of the population is allergic to nickel and patient has no known contact with nickel.\n\n# Possible Triggers:\n\nCurrently there are **no** reliable triggers that point to a cause  only triggers that exacerbate the issue.\n\n* Water, 50%, showers can trigger light redness without itching\n* Cloths, 50%, contact with tight clothing triggers more itching\n* Stress, <1%\n* Chocolate, <1%\n* Coffee, <1%\n\n# Doctor's Diagnoses:\n\n* Eczema, (L20.84), JACK ARBISER\n* Urticaria, (L70.0), JACK ARBISER, ZACHARY EYRE\n* Dermatographism, TINA CHEN\n* Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, TINA CHEN\n* Physical Urticaria, TINA CHEN\n* Cold-Induced Urticaria, TINA CHEN\n* Cholinergic Urticaria Dermatitis, TINA CHEN\n\n# Alternative Diagnoses:\n\n*  Chronic Pruritus\n* Scrotal Dermatitis\n* Fungal Infection\n* Urticarial Vasculitis\n* Coliergic Urtikara\n* Acult Bacteria\n* Acult UTI\n* MRSA\n*  Neuropathic Itch\n\n# Symptom Timeline:\n\nThis timeline includes other conditions that may or may not be related.\n\nChlamydia: 6/2022 \\[Cured with Antibiotics\\]\n\nToe Fungus: 7/8/2022 \\[Cured with Antifungals\\]\n\nNew Unexplained Acne: 6/2022 (8/2/2022) \\[Cured with 0.3% Adapalene\\]\n\n**Spontaneous Groin Itching:** 8/10/2022\n\nExcessive Groin Perspiration/Wetness: 8/11/2022\n\n**Spontaneous Neck Itching:** 8/26/2022\n\nViral Infection with Fever of 103: 11/1/2022\n\nFatigue/Sleepiness: 11/2022 \\[Symptoms Subsided\\]\n\nIching Temporarily Vanquished by Prednisone: 11/24/2022 \\[Itching Returns Right After\\]\n\nItching Expands Down Inner Thigh & Darkens Slightly: 11/25/2022\n\nNeck Itching Worsens & Turns Red After Showers: 12/9/2022\n\nNeck Itching Worsens & Waking Up From Extreme Neck Itching: 2/27/2023\n\nLittle Red Dots Merge on Arms: 4/1/2023\n\nItching Expands to Arms: 4/1/2023\n\n# Medication Timeline:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/epijheyx10ua1.png?width=3416&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a516a42087106385714bb5ee2118cc345b3e808d\n\n# Progression:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ir9ney6f30ua1.jpg?width=792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=006e61a6038d387e23ec599dcffaabdafb2bd447\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oz41a9tf30ua1.jpg?width=792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ec40c23e95392221225112cf70b637bf0fba8e16\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/78bqpzag30ua1.jpg?width=792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=64804a38f95e4bbc6f501e0aa55271cbb8c5979e\n\n&#x200B;"""

and i should be so happy, i have a girlfriend who i fuckin love and everything is great and i have so many friends but i just hate myself and dont know how to deal with it. at least on adderall now it just feels bittersweet and i understand the sadness is what adds depth to my view of the world, without these intense chemical imbalances where the world is a dark, evil place, i would never be able to respect the indescribable beauty in the mundane.\n\nanyways, also im male and 16 if those details mean anything to the story. i prefer newports but smoking is fucking gross and i recommend nobody ever start. its just a problem ive been working on quitting. put lemon or lime juice in vodka and slam it to just get drunk with not too much of the gross taste. merlot is fucking awful. i dont play video games but earthbound and mother 3 are both indescribably beautiful. ive started prozac. im also on lithium and seroquel. i took a lot of seroquel a while ago and it felt a bit like my brain was melting but in a okay way. i didnt die. beer is gross and doesnt get you drunk fast enough. i only drink to get drunk. i hope someday to experience delirium tremens. ive attempted to drink a ton of days in row before to do it but i didnt get anywhere. adderall is great but please nobody go down the path of drugs. especially opiates. no adderall either. weed is overrated and fuck stoners, its a stupid personality crutch for people who are boring and want to make up for it in marijuana. i love you meredith. i am not wearing a shirt and i am in 7/11 and im wearing jorts but jorts are pretty stupid but its okay. this is more of a diary now. i love synthesizers and really want to buy a roland juno-60. i can link my soundcloud if anyone is interested in hearing weird 80s synthpop made with all genuine analog equipment and no DAWs. ok thanks. bye everyone. i love you all and understand what youre going through because i am too and i just want everybody to be strong.\n\nquick edit: i also have borderline personality disorder, which really adds to the intensity of the mood swings and the instability of my self image. im sure it also is what leads to my propensity to both experiment with drugs and also become dependent on them. i also worry about how easily i become attached to people and how i possibly feel emotions (such as love) to a degree few others mirror, so i will struggle eternally to feel like i have a truly mutual and balanced connection with nearly anyone. plus sometimes i just instantly lose feelings for people when they start to have feelings for me, which just further complicates my worries for how long i can sustain living within this personality i put up to other people to hide how troubled i am underneath. also im not wearing a shirt but i didnt get kicked out of the 7/11 for it so i guess thats pretty cool. its free slushie day so why not take advantage of that. i love thrift shopping because they have awesome 80s clothes and i have a deep genuine love for the 80s due to me growing up with a ton of my parents belongings from when they were near my age (including my dads david bowie vinyl collection!) so its deeply influenced my main interests and my music tastes. (i love new order, omd, george clanton, oneohtrix point never, percival pembroke, sales, bulldog eyes, alex g, arthur shea, software, esprit, satin sheets, and ill add more in a bit). also i have a deep love for psychology and have done a insane amount of studying into topics such as attachment theory, freuds theories, the past of psychology (and textbooks from the 60s), and schizophrenia (as more of a case subject of psychosis and that spectrum of mental illness instead of just the illness on its own). also i dont want to come off as a pseudo-intellectual, i used some big words in this but its just because no other words appeared in my mind that fit as well and i probably misused them all anyways. i used to be pretty smart in elementary school (lol) but then mental illness backhanded me in middle school and ive been a shitty unmotivated student since. maybe if i can maintain the motivation i have right now ill be able to manage. oh well.\n\nalso i know im young and its very easy to dismiss this all because itll all okay in time but really in the deepest depths of depression none of that means shit and id like to find a way to deal with this so ill be alive to see that point in the future. i understand everything ive said is stupid and reading it must come off as a pathetic mess of words and i feel the same but maybe somebody might feel a lil spice of empathy by reading this and thats all i really need. ill make it through all of this, i think.\n\nokay im done with the edit now\n\nquick second edit: i took 2 more adderall and bought a pair of pink sweatpants at goodwill because why not. they were way overpriced. also, super important music: i fucking love hiroshi yoshimura beyond articulation. he means so much to me. i got the vinyl represses from music for nine post cards and pier and loft which were quite expensive but who cares because theyre beautiful and i cried like a little bitch for both first listens. also listen to his album flora 1987 and green, the title track from green is indescribable. please listen to him for me kay? thanks.\n\ngoodbye for now.'"

I was on a high dose (40 mg I believe) long taper of prednisone from Nov. 2021 (went to the urgent care on Black Friday) to end of Dec. 2021.\n\n\tDec. 2021 bloodwork: Creatine Kinase low (24 / range 29-143); white blood cell count high (17.5 / range 3.8-10.8); hemoglobin high but barely (15.8 / range 11.7-15.5); hematocrit high (46.4 / range 35-45%); platelet count high (412 / range 140-400); absolute neutrophils high (15,295 / range 1500-7800). ANA positive at 1:1280 with pattern nuclear dense fine speckled. Rheumatoid Factor <14 (range <14). C Reactive Protein 0.4 (range <8)\n\n\tJan. 2022 bloodwork: Rheum ordered HLA-B27 for Ankylosing spondylitis, negative. Comp 3 high but barely (158 / range 79-152). Comp 4 ok (42 / range 18-55). ANA titer >1:640 no range specified, pattern homogenous/speckled resembling DFS. CRP fine (<0.5 / 0.0-0.9). ESR fine (6 / 0-25). IG # high (0.1 / 0.0) IG % high (0.5 / 0.1-0.3). All of my ANA 9 returned fine/ within range - Centromere Ab (3 / <100), Chromatin (11 / <99), dsDNA (1 / <40), RNP/Sm (15 / <83), SCL-70 (2 / <32), SM 11 / <89), SSA (13 / <91), SSB 3 / <73), ssDNA (54 / <99).\n\n\tI had pelvic and lumbar spine MRIs in Jan. 2022 which returned with spondylolisthesis and disc disease/degeneration at L4-L5 per the radiologist. No sacroilitis. Minimal gluteus minimus tendinosis which I did PT for. No abnormalities noted in SI joints.\n\n\tspine x Ray in 2019 (around when I started having back problems) also unremarkable, mild narrowing of L4-L5 disc height and mild facet joint degenerative changes. No abnormalities noted SI joints.\n\n\tdid PT in 2021 for my low back, saw some short term benefit for several months. Did PT in early 2022 for my hip, PT said he thought it was bursitis, saw some improvement short term as well but am experiencing the same pain again now.'"

I've been recently diagnosed with fibro and tmj, waiting to see a maxilo for that, I grind alot, I will get an occlusal plaque for my grinding soon.  Tooth #31 became slightly raised or my bite was misaligned, i am not sure but it was painful stabbing shooting pain almost like a shock into it that throbbed into the nerve, pain comes goes up to behind my eye and one side of my jaw, I have had nerve pain and it feels familiar, but very inflammed, gum look fine but sensitive, I have random bouts of numbness too like electric shock into the lips or jaw.  Not too sensitive to cold or heat felt normal, went to an emergency dentist and said I might have a microfacture, so i might need a root canal cause sensitive to biting, the thing is my teeth are HYPER sensitive, going to the dentist send me in pain for days after a normal cleaning or when I need a filling,  most of them hurt by simply brushing them and since its inflammed at my jaw it feels horrible,  but doesnt know my medical history and all cause it was a rush and i felt like she didn't have time cause they were closing soon. \n\nShe prescribed mouth wash with chlorixidine and nsaid, which I think helped. Xray looked fine no sign of abcess or fracture but warned of microfracture. Thing is I chipped tooth in the past and I know how horrible hot and cold feel and it is very different.\n\nWould a rct be prescribed in my case? I am not against it at all, but I am not sure if its the other medical conditions  i have that are flaring up, I cannot see my usually dentist until a few days but somewhat  anxious about needing a rct even if I know the rate of success are really high.\n\nI currently have no medication for fibro tmj and tn, wondering if it would help beside nsaid"""

Just stating straight out that I have a dentist, but apparently he's never seen pain/swelling like this happen before, and I'm getting frustrated, so I thought I'd ask the Internet if anyone has any thoughts. \n\nI got my wisdom teeth taken out 2/26 this year-- both top and my left bottom. The left bottom was a little complicated and he cut bone, so I got antibiotics and the pain was managed with Advil. I developed dry socket (bad taste, pain didn't get better) and was instructed to rinse with saline. Pain got better, but never went away, but it got to something like 0.1-0.5/10, so I figured that was that and I put off making an appointment. The pain was mostly in my jaw at that point. \n\nFlash forward to last week-- I started having more pain, including pain in my jaw, gum, and my ear. I made an appointment for last Thursday (4/15). Doc gave me an antibiotic rinse.\n\nSaturday 4/17-- pain gets worse. I get codeine and amoxicillin (allergic to PCN). \n\nSunday 4/18-- face swollen like I have the mumps. See the dentist again, he drains an abscess and pulls out a piece of bone. He explains that the bone died while I had dry socket and the fragment of bone caused an infection. Says I should feel better. Novocaine from the draining wore off while I was driving home and it was some of the worst pain of my life.\n\nMonday 4/19-- Switch to hydrocodone for pain because the codeine isn't working. The hydrocodone works no better, but whatever. Also switch to clindamycin every 6 hours. \n\nWednesday 4/21-- Swelling goes way down. Still swollen, but doesn't look like I have the mumps. Little to no change in pain; no change in treatment.\n\nThe pain is the same today, pretty awful. \n\nDoc plans on putting mesh over the dry socket tomorrow, which he says should help with the pain.\n\nRight now, my pain ranges from 5/10 to 9/10, averaging about an 8/10, and I spend a lot of time curled up in bed crying because of the pain. The lymph node under the jaw in particular is EXCRUCIATING. The inside of my mouth looks fairly normal other than swelling. I'm on q4 Advil and hydrocodone and q6 clindamycin and the pain is still incredible. I wasn't on any pain meds aside from occasional ibuprofen for either the extraction or the dry socket, so I'm not just being dramatic-- this is a whole other level. \n\nOther are duloxetine, dexmethylphenidate, synthroid, birth control, and migrelief vitamins  \nMedical history is Hashimoto's thyroiditis/hypothyroidism, migraines, depression, ADHD, autism\n\nAny advice would be fucking wonderful. I am in a lot of pain and pretty scared."""

NSAID problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/nulgs3/stomach_problems_and_acne/,b'Stomach problems and acne',,b'Hi everyone! I wanted to see if anyone else was dealing with what I am going through right now. Currently I am only getting nodules or cysts as im not really sure the difference between the two. But they are all very swollen and red. I realized that I only get these when I start having stomach problems which I have had issues with for the past 6 months. Its very strange because for the last 6 months I have had constipation for half of each month which is when my face would break out. It doesnt seem to be triggered by anything in particular but as a precaution I have limited gluten and dairy intake. I do believe that it was somehow caused by a 6 month treatment of oracea(20mg doxycycline) primarily because the medication was listed as a NSAID which is known to cause constipation. For the past 6 months I have been off the pill and I actually started to feel my stomach healing and my acne getting better. Until recently I started taking the anti acne club supplement which after being on it for a month caused me to break out again and have worsened stomach problems. I dont think its a bad product I just dont think it was right for me. Even after I have been off of it for a couple days my constipation and breakouts have remained which prompted me to search up any connection between constipation and acne. I wasnt surprised to see that there is a big connection between the two. So im planning on buying some fiber supplements to help regulate my bowel movements which I am thinking might help my face. I hope this helps someone and I hope im not the only one with this issue!'
acetaminophen eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/11yx8fl/sore_throat_5_days_post_wisdom_extraction/,b'Sore Throat 5 days post Wisdom Extraction',,"b'NAD \n\non March 17, 2023 I got my bottom two Wisdom Teeth extracted, this is after Ive had my top wisdom teeth extraction on two different occasions (02/17/23 & 02/27/23) which both have continued to healed fine over the course of the past month. \n\nI was given Amoxicillin for the first procedure, 10 day course, (02/17-02/27) and another 7 day course of Amoxicillin during this most recent procedure. I also have alternated Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen, as well as a 5 day course of Tylenol-3s that I stopped taking on day 3 (03/20/23).\n\nMy issue started last night (03/21/22), I dont know if its correlated but I did my normal salt rinse after eating, and noticed a rapid onset of a sore/scratchy throat almost immediately after I had finished. I though this may have been Dry Throat, from too much sodium concentrate and decided to intake 4 glasses of 8oz water before bed and a cup of tea for relief. Minimal change from original pain and I had issues sleeping due to this. \n\nWoke up this morning to what felt like razors being pushed down my throat every time I swallow. Literally just started bawling my eyes out because If wisdom teeth pain wasnt enough, this pain was now doubled and my tonsils are swollen. \n\nWent to Urgent Care and was strep tested, covid tested, and my tonsils were checked for any infection. All came back negative and I was told to finish antibiotic course and use a Lidocaine Mouthwash for numbing my throat pain. Was told if issue persists/worsens I should see my primary care doctor in 2-3 days. \n\nMy question is when I called my dentist this morning they would not even see me because Sore throat is not related to wisdom teeth extraction and I need to see a doctor for an option. But when I look online, many practices mention sore throat and scratchy feeling when swallowing post Wisdom teeth extraction. \n\nCould this possibly be a side effect of my wisdom teeth or an infection caused by the healing process? \n\nShould I call my dentist back and let them know what urgent care said and request to be seen again for the pain? \n\nHave anyone dealt with this/Has any dentist heard of this before and could weigh in on what I am possibly dealing with?\n\n\nMore Info : \nA couple hours after UC I have began to notice a lot of thick mucus drainage in my mouth, as well as in the back of my throat. I also developed a runny nose. \n\nFirst thought goes to sinus infection but as mention in a comment, I am unsure if this is even correlated with my wisdom teeth anymore since I have my bottom set extracted recently, and most sinus infections are associated with the top set. \n\nIs it possible to develop a sinus infection if my teeth are on the bottom? Or could I have develop this issue from my top set being extracted 4/2 weeks ago (top left side 4 weeks post op/ top right side 2 weeks post op) \n\nSinus pressure is also noticeable, but not painful, just a normal clogged nose.\n\n1 WEEK UPDATE : \n\nI was diagnosed with a sinus infection, took a couple rounds of Mucinex the first couple of days and started feeling WAY better. Did end up giving the infection to my boyfriend but he didnt get his wisdom teeth out so its been easier on him. \n\nAs far as an update to my teeth are concerned, I ended up having to go back to the dentist after I wasnt contagious anymore due to experiencing 1-3 hours of dull aching pain on the right side of my extraction site all the way to my front canines, sometimes however the pain would present itself in sharp intense shooting pains as well. It would linger even with Tylenol and ibuprofen combo, and only finally feel calm after I would ice my face and place ice cubes in my mouth for extended periods of time. \n\nTurns out I have been pushing a Bone Spur out of my right extraction site thats creating insane pain around my jaw / extraction. The pain on my bottom teeth adjacent to the extraction have either been going through sympathetic pain  due to the increased pressure around the area, but I also might have temporary damage to my trigeminal nerve, which could also be creating the dull ache I feel and sharp pains. \n\nAll in all, im still glad I got my wisdom teeth out but even after I made an effort to do the procedure and follow all the guidelines after, I still ended up with a couple complications that I had no idea were associated with Wisdom Teeth Extractions (excluding the sinus infection)\n\nI guess my best advice based on my experience would be do your research before the procedure so you know what signs are presenting themselves for all the different types of complications that show up after a wisdom tooth removal, and just call your dentist if you dont know!!!'"

I tried stretching my neck but that just made it hurt more. \n\n\\- Headache worsens, advil/ibuprofen no help. It felt like someone was squeezing my head and pressing ballpoint pens into the base of my head where the spinal cord inserts. Saw flashing lights while working at my computer. \n\n\\- Hot flashes and night sweats. \n\n**Friday 01/29/2021:**\n\n\\- Saw my doctor. I didn't tell him specifically about the neck stiffness because I thought it was just from sleeping on it wrong, and he already knows about the myoclonus. I was just really worried I had COVID. \n\n\\- Had another negative COVID test at the doctor, also negative for influenza A and B. My vitals were OK. Breathing was a little fast they said and I was very clammy. They gave me 8mg Zofran for the Nausea which helped instantly. \n\n\\- neck still stiff, fever reduced. Headache very prevalent still. I went home and iced and stretch my neck. That really helped my headache, which made me believe something else was going on.\n\n\\- night sweats but overall a better sleep than previous. \n\n**Saturday 01/30/2021 (today):**\n\n\\- threw up a little bit this morning, headache very bad in the morning, neck less stiff and much less painful to move around. I used a heat pack and that helped even more.  \n\n\\- took Zofran and again it helped. Fever seems to be gone. only minor body chills in the morning. body aches much less. lower intensity myoclonus. as of posting this I am overall feeling much better. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nfirst of all, thanks for reading :) feeling so much better today and I am thankful I do not have COVID. I came across meningitis when reading about the neck and headache thing with flu symptoms on google, and read it can be very dangerous. \n\nI am now concerned that I could have had meningitis, and just didn't catch it. I feel i am on the tail end of whatever this is (my doctor didnt know but thinks it is viral), however I am still worried if it is meningitis that there can be longer term effects. \n\nThe reason I think it might not be meningitis, and just maybe I slept on my neck wrong is that while i did stretch one time which made it worse, stretching another time (later in the week), made it better which wouldnt happen with meningitis i dont think. The pain did come back swiftly, but that can be casued by a lot of things. Also no one i know has had meningitis.\n\nThe reason i think it could be meningitis is because the neck seemed to be linked to that terrible headache. I have never had headache pain like that. it surrounded my entire head from my eyebrows, forehead, back of head, and hurt incredibly bad near the back of the head where the neck comes it. It SUCKED! some moments I could not stand up and rarely sleep.  \n\nAt the moment, I was so concered with not having COVID that I bushed these symptoms off to flu or caused by myoclonus or sleeping wrong. \n\nI have been rapidly getting better since yesterday afternoon, so I do not think there is a lot of cause for alarm, but I am more worried about any long term effects that meningitis could cause. \n\nAre there any thoughts? Regardless, I am going to call my doctor on monday and let him know about this but I wanted to put it out here first. \n\nThanks."""

Also occasionally numb if I do certain stretches. The biggest lately is this weird swelling on right wrist almost like its a veiny line popping out which often happens after certain stretches or movements. But not a ganglion cyst according to doc. \n\nHad mri which was mostly normal but doc told me some white fluid was detected in right wrist compared to left but again no ganglion cysts apparently. \n\nTo quote mri analysis: (right wrist) demonstrate very slight increased peritendinous T2 signal in the third and fourth dorsal compartments at the left wrist at the level of the distal radius which resolves more distally and is not present at the musculotendinous junction proximally .. also later tendons are intact without longitudinal increased T2 signal in the intrasubstance of the tendons. Im not really sure what this means but any interpretation would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThe ortho went on to say that the picture is consistent with a right third and fourth dorsal component mild tenosynovitis. \n\nI got a corticosteroid injection in my right wrist and the doc says that Ill have to let it run its course but he also said himself its kinda unclear whats going on which brings me here. \n\nThe main reason Ive been so pedantic with the diagnosis is because its hard to determine whether I should do stretches for de quervains or tendonitis (which surprisingly are pretty different sets of exercises/stretches) \n\nI take focalin and lexapro also if thats at all relevant. \n\nFor treatments Ive done icing, rest from the gym for months now, heating, stretching, eccentric movements, sleeping in braces, KT tape, ibuprofen in the past, ergonomic keyboards and typing with fingers instead of thumbs. \n\nIdk if this is relevant but I also squeeze my thumb with my middle and ring finger to crack it so idk if that contributes or not lol. \n\nThats pretty much everything, please let me know if you have any clue whats going on and let me know if you need clarifying questions.'"

Advil vomit,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/wgyutl/not_sure_whats_wrong_with_me_mentally_anyone_find/,b'Not sure whats wrong with me mentally. Anyone find themselves getting so distracted?',,"b'Idk whats going on with my brain lately  (Female 25). So Ill start with some background to everything. When I was in highschool I was told I was depressed and had anxiety so that was nothing new. When I started working at a call centre (20) I noticed more than just depression and anxiety. I went and got help which is when I was diagnosed with OCD. I went through so many medications before I found one that worked. Something traumatic happened 2 years later and then I was diagnosed with PTSD as well as panic attack disorder. In high school I was a healthy weight but after the years I gained over 100+ pounds sitting at 261 (22). I decided to come off my medication and started dieting and working out. I lost all the weight and got back down to 145(23) I noticed my mental health was doing great. With covid kicking in things got bad again and I ended up in a psychward. It was the beginning of having memory loss. I asked if it could be adhd distracting me or making me forgetful but they said no. They said it was probably the PTSD. Any how things started to get better except I started having my first aura migraine.(24) The migraines were so intense it caused slurred speach, tingling sensation in half my body, and I would vomit for hours on end crying praying I would die. These attacks crippled me from work and happened once every 3 months. I seen a neurologist and had an mri (I have braces so it blocked a lot of it and said Ill have to re do when braces come off) and basically they told me to take Advil and magnesium and sent me on my merry little way. Now the point for adding all of this in is because Im wondering if my OCD or Migraines could have caused this. So heres what has been happening:\n\nWhen people talk to me Im having a hard time hearing/listening. My boyfriend calls me deaf all the time and says I should get my hearing tested. The thing is, its not that I CANT hear him. If a train is going off in the background or cars are driving by, my brain immediately focuses on that. Its like my brain tunes everything else out including the person talking to me to focus more on the sound in the background. I feel bad because when someone starts talking to me and lets say a washer or dryer is going, I constantly have to keep asking them to repeat themselves and telling them I cant hear them. \nMy dad and brother both have ADHD but I was told I dont have it. Its not that my mind is wondering causing me to day dream while others speak, its just sounds. \nAnother thing that has started up that stresses me out so bad I cry, I cant get any tasks done. My bedroom needs cleaning but everytime I start cleaning it, I find myself doing something else. Example: I started cleaning my room, saw my cat on the bed so I went and patted her. As Im patting her I notice my phone so I pick it up. Next thing you know an hour has gone by and Im watching videos. I catch myself doing that so I put it down and start cleaning again. I run across my boyfriends laptop and now Im on there web browsing and another 20 mins has passed. I once again catch myself and start cleaning my room but found my bible and decided to start reading it. Next thing you know so much time has passed I throw tv on and go to bed. Now my father is upset with me because I was suppose to make some important phone calls for him but didnt make it as I didnt finish my first task of cleaning my room. My room should only take me 10 mins tops to clean but now it has taken me 3 days. All I have to do is empty the room garbage, vacuum, dust, and tidy my desk but it seems so impossible with all these distractions. My OCD has me wanting to clean my room FIRST before doing his task as I like doing things in order.\nMy friends are mad at me because Im constantly late for our hangouts because I go through the same thing. Trying to get ready to leave the house is the worst. I use to be so organized and now I feel like my life is a mess. I now ended up recently losing my job because retaining all the new information is so hard for me. I cant retain information and Im so forgetful now. Idk what to do. My doctor originally blamed ptsd for this but 1000% think it has nothing to do with it as I feel I dont even have ptsd anymore. Could my ocd be causing this? Ive asked about it being adhd but the doctor said if I had it I would have been diagnosed long before now. I feel like my life is being crippled by what ever is happening to me. Not sure if aura migraines can effect the brain. If anyone else has gone through this what helped?'"

anticonvulsant problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/v4o1m0/memory_loss_and_mental_health_medications/,b'Memory Loss and Mental Health Medications',,"b""Memory loss is a common topic within the mental health world. I'm an RN that works in Mental Health & going to do my best to summarize some research on *which* mental health medications impact our memory and *why* they do.\n\n**Memory** refers to the mechanisms that are used to collect, accumulate, preserve, and later retrieve information. There are three actions involved in **'memory'**: processing, storing, and recalling.\n\n## I will Include the link to the original post that is probably easier to follow but also going to include all the info below.\n\n[https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/](https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs\n\n**citalopram, celexa, escitalopram, lexapro, fluoxetine, prozac, sarafem, symbyax, fluvoxamine, luvox, luvox CR, paroxetine, paxil, paxil CR, pexeva, sertraline, zoloft, vilazodone, viibryd**\n\n### Drug class\n\nThis is a very common drug class; prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, migraines, panic attacks, eating disorders, PTSD, OCD, and even chronic pain. Over 10% of the US takes an SSRI.\n\n### What Do SSRIs Do?\n\nWhat does every medication within this class have in common? They all increase the level of Serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. When you take a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, youre blocking the neurons from reabsorbing Serotonin, meaning there is more Serotonin available.\n\nSo what does Serotonin do? Well, A LOT. Serotonin influences our mood and emotional state, our digestion, appetite, our sleep cycle. It is found in your brain, in your intestines and even in your blood. One could argue that it impacts everything.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nSerotonin is even in animals, plants and fungus. While we can measure the levels in our blood we cannot measure the levels within our brain. Meaning were all in the dark as to how much is within our brain and whether or not its even correlated to the amount in our blood.\n\nHow SSRIs Impact Memory\n\nAge and gender do not seem to influence the data that SSRIs are correlated with memory effects. Something that is important to mention, is that while research has shown that SSRIs are *correlated* with memory loss, that doesnt exactly mean that they CAUSE it. Correlation and cause are two different things. Many people that take SSRIs also take benzodiazepines, drink, smoke, have genetic predisposition to memory loss, etc. Depression and anxiety themselves can even cause memory problems.\n\nSummary\n\nSo, after reading through many articles, there overall wasnt enough credible information to emphatically say that an SSRI causes memory loss. In fact, I came across more research that suggested SSRIs improve cognitive performance and memory. Some data also specifically supported that SSRIs can improve memory for patients experiencing psychosis and depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Tricyclic Antidepressant | TCAs\n\n**anafranil, clomipramine, asendin, amoxapine, elavil, amitriptyline, norpramin, desipramine, pamelor, nortriptyline, sinequan, doxepin, surmontil, trimipramine, tofranil, imipramine, vivactil, protiptyline**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThe word tricyclic refers to the three molecular ring shapes associated with this drug class. These existed before SSRIs, but they seem to cause more side effects. This has led to SSRIs being more commonly prescribed nowadays. TCAs are still often administered for things like anxiety, depression, migraines, panic disorder, eating disorders, mood disorders, insomnia, hormone disorders, bedwetting, and even nerve pain.\n\nWhat do Tricyclic Antidepressants Do?\n\nWhat do all TCAs have in common? Similar to an SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants impact neurotransmitters. But, in addition to serotonin, they also block the reabsorption of norepinephrine. They ALSO block acetylcholine receptors. These key differences create a cascade of effects in the body that do impact memory. These key differences are also the culprit for the common side effects in this drug class like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nIn 1945, the Sulphur bridge of the phenothiazine ring of promethazine was altered to synthesize G22355 ( a weak antihistamine and mild anticholinergic with sedative properties). The new 'invention' was tested as an antipsychotic. It was ineffective for schizophrenia, but did have antidepressant properties. Thus, the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) was discovered.\n\nHow TCAs Impact Memory\n\nThere are multiple reasons why a TCA impacts our memory. **The first reason** is that we retain memory best when norepinephrine is released at an optimal rate. These drugs block the reabsorption of norepinephrine; which is known to be a moderator of memory. With too much of it, we are anxious and stressed, too little of it and we are drowsy and not as coherent. Either way, the drug has an impact on norepinephrine which directly influences how we store memory.\n\n**The second reason** why this drug class impacts memory is because it competes with our natural antagonists on muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors. It is well documented that these drugs block muscarinic receptors (which is an acetylcholine receptor), and acetylcholine directly impacts learning and memory.\n\n>*Muscarinic*acetylcholine*receptors* in the hippocampus and cortex underlie*memory*formation\n\nSummary\n\nSo, TCAs are a drug that research has linked with memory impairments and dementia. These drugs interfere with our bodies baseline of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. As with any drug; sometimes they create an optimal effect on a person, as for others, not so much. If a person is too excitable and anxious, a TCA can improve their quality of life (even could improve memory if their extreme anxiety was impairing it), while for another it can make them drowsy and leave a bad impression.\n\n\\*Note each drug within the class impacts the degree of these effects a little differently.\n\nIf youre feeling like doing a deep dive into some of the articles I read to gain clarity, by all means, click the links below!\n\n[Differential Cognitive Actions of Norepinephrine 2 and 1 Receptor Signaling in the Prefrontal Cortex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4876052/)\n\n[The effect of tricyclic antidepressants on cholinergic responses of single cortical neurones.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1666268/?page=7)\n\n[A brief history of antidepressant drug development: from tricyclics to beyond ketamine](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/acta-neuropsychiatrica/article/brief-history-of-antidepressant-drug-development-from-tricyclics-to-beyond-ketamine/B5C9D55C6299BC41B237187DB609DB68)\n\n## \n\n## Benzodiazepines\n\n**alprazolam, xanax, chlordiazepoxide, librium, clonazepam, klonopin, clorazepate, tranxene, diazepam, valium, lorazepam, ativan, oxazepam, serax, temazepam, restoril, triazolam, halcion**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThese are commonly considered anti-anxiety medication (though can be used for seizures, insomnia, and muscle spasms). They work by quickly slowing down important parts of our brain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets taco bout it.\n\nThis drug class specifically targets the GABA-A receptor, enhancing its effect, which slows down our central nervous system; this makes us feel relaxed, because the drug has retarted a major gear in our system (sometimes this is EXACTLY what we need).\n\nDid You Know?\n\nAnesthesiologists often give Versed (a benzodiazepine) so patients will not remember surgery?\n\nHow Benzodiazepines Impact Memory\n\nThis drug class changes our mental state & while the drug is advantageously quick acting, the effects linger. Short-term memory is not as affected, but long-term memory is specifically impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory and thus not consolidated into memory storage. The effects are similar to the long-term effects of alcoholism (alcohol is also a CNS depressant). Both of these substances, used long term actually damage our brain.\n\nThis is why a rehab center isnt going to allow the use of 'said drug' while recovering. This is why therapists often (but not always) stray away from patients taking 'said drug' while trying to work on trauma, recovery, etc. If the brain is not functioning & you're not able to remember anything, how can you work on it? The most effective aspects of benzodiazepines are precisely why individuals have a tendency to become dependent on them.\n\nNow, don't shoot the messenger. Obviously, there is a time and a place for benzodiazepines. They're an actual life saver for the (hopefully) occasional panic attack. But how sadistic is that Benzodiazepines have addictive properties, which means that with *repeated* use we will need *increasingly* higher doses, making the dent in your memory more and more indisputable.\n\nFull Disclosure\n\nMy mother was an addict, benzodiazepines being her drug of choice.\n\nDo you know an addict whose drug of choice is a benzodiazepine? No SHAME, but if so, you can probably attest that **they dont remember shit.**\n\nHow about an addict whose drug of choice is alcohol? All love here, but you can say for certain, *they dont remember shit*.\n\nThere has even been a fair amount of data to support that the risk of Alzheimers is elevated in those taking the drug for over 6 months. One Harvard study even speculated that it would raise the risk by 84%! Seems unrealistic, but who am I to question Harvard; I'll add the link below if you're also feeling speculative.\n\nAnother point of concern is that this drug will inhibit your brain from initiating activity of GABA A (since the medication has so kindly been doing it). What this means is that after the drug is long gone from your system, your brain experiences a lag in restoring the normal GABA balance.\n\nThis is often what is referred to as *rebound anxiety* because your anxiety is likely to get worse, before it gets better after taking a benzodiazepine, especially if taken long term.\n\nTake it from a nurse who works in mental health; it's not enjoyable being the bystander of a patient trying to escape their benzo addiction.\n\nBut this is why the mental health world is increasingly trying to move towards low dosing and only prescribing for a limited amount of time.\n\nNow, Benzodiazepines are very dangerous to quit cold turkey, so please dont go flush yours down the toilet after reading this.\n\nWhen Benzodiazepines were first discovered they offered an immediate solution to the overwhelming crippling anxiety that many people face, but the harsh reality is that were now in a benzo addiction crisis. Were learning over time, as a society and those changes dont happen overnight. And trust me, as a mental health professional I myself occasionally grow infuriated at the amount of family doctors who prescribe copious amounts of benzodiazepines only to later turn the patient away after addiction has crippled them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Harvard Article Claims Benzodiazepine use may raise risk of Alzheimers disease](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/benzodiazepine-use-may-raise-risk-alzheimers-disease-201409107397#:~:text=People%20who%20had%20taken%20a%20benzodiazepine%20for%20three,84%25.%20The%20type%20of%20drug%20taken%20also%20mattered.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Right now Im having amnesia and dj vu at the same time.

This drug class actually encompasses three different major classes\n\n1. Blocking Sodium Channels\n2. Enhancement of GABA Inhibition\n3. Regulation of Synaptic Releases\n\nWhy it Impacts Memory\n\nOverall, anticonvulsants work in different ways; trust me I rode the magic school for HOURS trying to gain an understanding of them to write this. Truthfully, we still have a lot to learn about them. Their impact is complicated and the effects range based on the dose and drug.\n\nFor instance, Topamax has pretty diverse pharmacologic actions, because of that, it **has** been linked with impaired concentration, cognitive dulling, psychomotor retardation, language and comprehension difficulties, rather extreme effects on short-term memory and working memory, poor verbal fluency and word-finding, reduced IQ scores, abnormal thinking and delayed cognitive speed. Because of this dark cloud of side effects, Topamax is sometimes referred to as 'Dope-A-Max'.\n\nHowever, a more selective medication within the drug class such as Phenytoin or Tegretol are more specific to blocking sodium channels. Overall, they seem to have less impact on memory and cognitive function.\n\nMany of these drugs listed above have an impact on GABA, and long term exposure to GABA agents can alter the functionality of GABA permanently, which means there are potentially permanent consequences to cognition, behaviors, and memory.\n\nPhenobarbital has been linked to lower IQ, and worse effects than Depakote and Tegretol, however it is actually a barbituate. Its effects are similar to benzodiazepines which you can read more about above.\n\nGabapentin, used for seizures and often mood disorders, belongs to it's own drug class. Still, it **has** been linked to memory impairment. Hence, the name, it also impacts GABA, which as mentioned several times now, certainly plays a hand in our ability to remember. At this point there isnt enough research to say its linked to dementia though.\n\nAs far as drugs for epilepsy, Gabapentin is tolerated much better than many others. Its also worth mentioning that this drug seems to have more *short term* effects on memory. Some will experience a disorienting feeling or short term memory loss while taking Gabapentin, but the reports of long term memory being impacted are reported less often.\n\n[Long Term Effects of Gabapentin](https://deserthopetreatment.com/sedatives/gabapentin-addiction/long-term-side-effects/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Antipsychotics\n\n**sometimes referred to as major tranquilizers or neuroleptics; risperidone, risperdal, quetiapine, seroquel, olanzapine, zyprexa, ziprasidone, zeldox, paliperidone, invega, aripiprazole, abilify, clozapine, clozaril, fluphenazine**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used as the first line treatment for schizophrenia & sometimes used for mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, Tourette's syndrome & Huntington's disease\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nMost drugs in this class work to block Dopamine, though some do impact other chemicals in the brain.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nOddly enough, memory seems to actually be improved when using an antipsychotic for a person with psychotic symptoms, though there are many that take medications within this class that are not psychotic. So let's talk about that more.\n\nWhy It Impacts Memory\n\nFirst, let's skip back to the purpose of these drugs. Schizophrenia is the **major** psychotic disorder we use antipsychotics for. Some of the main symptoms are delusions, lack of motivation, unusual behaviors, and hallucinations. Dopamine has been thought to regulate our brains understanding of our surroundings and what it all means to us. So, it's to be expected that drugs within this class target Dopamine.\n\nThis class is broken up into two categories;\n\n**First Generation (old, typical):** Block Dopamine-2 Receptors, which means they also block acetylcholine, histamine and norepinephrine. which do impact the complex way in which we store memories. \\*More movement disorders come with the old ones.\n\n**Second Generation: (new, atypical):** Block Serotonin and Dopamine Receptors**.** Less risk of extra movements, increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and weight gain.\n\nWhat do they all have in common? **They impact Dopamine.** Long story short; A delicate balance of Dopamine is needed for memory to function. Since this class targets Dopamine, it's fair to say it has the potential to alter our memory. Whether that's a good or bad thing is specific to the patient, but it's typically an unwelcome effect.\n\n# \n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Antihistamines\n\n**brompheniramine, dimetane, benadryl, diphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clistin, clemastine, tavist, doxylamine, unisom, hydroxyzine, atarax, vistaril, promethazine, phenergan, triprolidine, triafed**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used for allergies but also used for anxiety. Antihistamines are divided into different 'generations' & target different histamine receptors in our body.\n\n* H1 Receptors: Found Throughout the Body\n* H2 Receptors: Mostly Stomach Acid Secretion\n* H3 Receptors: Central Nervous System\n* H4 Receptors: Still Being Researched\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nWe're actually still learning a lot about histamines but what we do know is that **anti-**histamines are usually anticholinergic; **blocking** receptors for choline. The problem is that we need choline to be readily available to have the ability to learn, understand and remember.\n\n### Why it Impacts Memory?\n\nBeing that antihistamines are often anticholinergic, they do impair our ability to think, learn and remember. Especially the first generation antihistamines that easily penetrate our brain. We already naturally produce less acetylcholine overtime. This is partly why as we age our ability to remember, think, and learn diminishes. It's widely known that anticholinergics impact memory, thinking, learning, and muscle function. It is also suggested that these drugs increase the risk of developing dementia.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe only drug within this class that can be given intravenously is Benadryl. Since Benadryl is a first generation, it impacts our body in many ways in addition to the reason why it's administered. Since first generation antihistamines are much less specific in their effects, they are affiliated with greater memory impairment. Though, being the only IV antihistamine available, it is still widely used in hospital settings.\n\n### Summary\n\nOverall, the effects range. Regarding mental health specifically; Vistaril, hydroxyzine and Atarax are commonly prescribed for anxiety. While your risks are much less severe than benzodiazepines, these are FIRST generation antihistamines. Therefore, they do have a sedating effect (precisely why they can relieve tension) but this is also means they do impair our ability to remember.\n\nAn example of second generation antihistamines are Claritin & Zyrtec. Unlike first generation antihistamines, these do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. Therefore, they relieve many effects of allergies, but do not have as many sedating properties or memory impairments associated with them. When it comes to anxiety though, Claritin & Zyrtec won't do you much good.\n\nHope this helps clarify some of the impacts of memory and mental health medications. Leave a comment if there is a drug you're still wondering about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is the link again for original post below. \n\n[https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/](https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/)"""
codeine problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/12sgtnc/intense_existentialism/,b'Intense Existentialism??',,"b'I want to first start off by saying I have no idea where to post about this feeling but, the closest explanation I saw was on another post in this community so I just said, why not? \n\nAlso let me preface.I abuse substances heavily. I dont know if thatll have any correlation but, you be the judge of that -The first drug I tried at about 12 (aside from wine at the dinner table) was xanax, soon after codeine, then weed, liquor, and finally psychedelics all before the age of 16. As of now I abuse liquor the most, at about a 5th of gin a day since 2019 & a heavy weed smoker. I got bad with my DOC (Benzos) and have been off of em for about 2 years now. Im quite familiar with therapy, treatment, and have never been on any formal prescribed medication. However I have been formerly diagnosed with dysthymia (early onset) at age 9. Ive had a couple suey-wooey attempts once upon a time and even more ideations as well which makes what this post about a bit more perplexing to me\n\nFor about the past 5 years Ive been having a heady/intense feeling persist mentally & emotionally where it just seems so fucking unbelievable that Im conscious and connected with not only myself but, other human beings as wellI experience overwhelming senses of gratitude, compassion, condolence, etc - basically it seems as if every emotion I experience is accentuated to the point where they become psychosomatic, which ranges from elevated heartbeat, rapid breathing, pacing, general feelings of restlessness or even full-on vigor.  The initial onset of these feelings happened maybe the 2nd or 3rd time doing psychedelics when I was about 17. Ideas of highlighting the importance of community, deep investigative introspection, and adventuring the spectrum of experience/being flooded my mind.I wrote them off as basic hippie-ass ideas, as I was just a teenage boy finally learning true empathy and what it meant to actually exist for the first time and just assured myself this is normal and Im just maybe becoming a halfway decent human being. As time progressed, these ideas and feelings became progressively more intense and persistent, I could spend hours if not days in this state. With whomever I interact with I feel compelled to talk with them about their entire damn being, with fervency at that!down to how their mind works, family, traumas, living situations, you name it & all the while im deeply intrigued/invested/concerned to the point where it even feels like im creeping myself out (its pretty cringe honestly) Me just realizing I can simply control my body blows me away sometimes to the point where I need to sit down for 5 minutes. Every emotion I feel is just accentuated to the point where it becomes a rollercoaster.I made a joke at myself saying Im like a pregnant lady (but actually made somewhat of sense because I know alcohol decreases testosterone/increases estrogen and causes weight gain which ive been experiencing via beer belly and gynecomastic tits but I refuted back to myself saying this state first started at 17 however, i do recognize the alcohol isnt exactly helping either) - ideas and feelings of intense existentialism is the best way i can describe it (& its becoming quite ironic that i heavily denounce solipsism and often rant about how solipsism is plaguing the western world now)\n\nTo add more context, my boundaries werent always the best and still (obviously) arent. However I want to add I dont have problems saying or taking Nos to/from individuals and/or groups and, respecting boundaries. I express general tact and decorum while speaking to people and have possessed the gift of gab & a healthy amount of charisma from a very young age but this here is just unprecedented.\n\nI understand and want to acknowledge this is one of those good problem scenarios & I know there are individuals with waaaaay worse problems than I. It just feels as if im constantly on sensory/emotional/mental overload & paired with my history of drug use and mental illness I get the inkling there could be more to this\n\nIf you made it to the end of this regardless of the reason why, thanks & if anyone else has experienced this individually or knows more about what Im describing, please interact\n\n\nPS Im pretty familiar with most of the spiritual/metaphysical stuff and didnt want this entire post to be perceived that Im havin some stereotypical Lvl 1 ass spiritual awakening, as Im inquiring on a psychological level'"

First you're a hypochondriac, then you're a drug seeker, finally they admit it is a real, possibly unknown physical disease that may never be diagnosed. Please help!""",,"b'Hello everyone, 25 year old male, 130lbs, 5\'10"" tall, on medications: Dexamethasone, Toradol, generic anti-histamines, corticosteroid puffer, sometimes antibiotics. Family history of: heart disease, kidney disease, various cancers (prostate, thyroid, pancreatic), autoimmune & heamatological disease (Lupus, Thalassemia, Ulcerative colitis, autoimmume thyroid disease, diabetes, Psoriasis)\n\nAfter visiting countless doctors and emergency rooms/hospitals, I am coming here out of desparation after the best doctor in Ontario admitted that my case has him stumped. I am deteriorating faster than ever and I know I do not have much longer to live\n \nSymptoms =\n\n-- Unexplained & recurring fevers, with meningitis type symptoms of stiff & painful neck, base of skull pain, photophobia as well as sudden swelling of eyes with a lot of puss-like crust that seals them shut, swelling of wrist, ankles, feet, throat, uvula, ears, sometimes other tissues / organs as well, and a general feeling of being deathly ill. These ""attacks"" / ""episodes"" last anywhere from 2 days to 4 or 5 weeks. \n\n-- Localized hives with redness around them, these hives have an itchy burn to them and either pop up at random, or after exposure to sunlight, artificial lights, or water. Can happen anywhere on the body but a small circular area. I chalked this up to ""allergies"" for years but lately Ive noticed it doesn\'t matter what season it is & eliminating food that could cause allergies has been completely ineffective. Interestingly the association between water & this symptom has always been evident\n\n-- Widespread area mainly top of hands up to eblows where all of the skin develops a bright red tone, becomes itchy, and feels like a 2nd degree burn. Wrapping with cold clothes and other physical traditional burn treatments helps\n\n-- large red area, with angry red circle in center, with a whitehead. Usually these are small but sometimes they swell up massively & prevent sitting or laying down properly. They appear to be infections but antibiotics does nothing whereas corticosteroids & toradol help (both for this and many other symptoms this holds true)\n\nActual infections:\n1. Gangrene of toe / foot (that needed lancing and draining but started going septic despite that treatment)\n2. Respiratory, bronch/strep at the same time 2 years in a row confirmed by culture\n3. Skin / muscle, these are rare compared to the phenomena that are clearly not infections due to their response to medication, but when it happens it is usually more severe and immediate responds to antibiotics so its obvious\n\n-- Extremely fast / thick skin growth on bottom lip & bottoms of feet, both left and right. Hands used to be unaffected. The thick skins color is very yellow on the soles of feet but not the other areas which has led to less worry about my liver than I think is necessary (Jaundice of mucus membranes / general skin jaundice has been noted in my ER records). The thick skin is very painful and causes the healthy skin around it to split and tear open from pressure, causing bleeding and dramatically increasing the local risk of infection. Worst area is the feet. A 2 or 3 inch thick layer of skin grows even when I am off my feet which is almost always now. Doctor thought it was classic callous when I was more active, but ended up classifying it as Hyperkeratosis once it became apparent that activity or pressure wasn\'t the cause. If the skin is cut off or treated in any way it comes back more aggresively, growing quicker than before and expands further. If it is not treated, it grows at a fast rate still but causes the skin around it to split open from the tightness etc. Very frustrating and debilitating. No treatments or remedies have prevented it from reoccuring or reduced the severity\n\n-- Hundreds of scars / stretch mark looking things primarily around my buttocks and thighs and knees, these are unexplained by growth, weight gain/loss or any other common cause\n\n-- Spontaneous bleeding, coughing up large amounts of blood, bright red poo, and one time where I woke up feeling deathly ill and nauseated & threw up a nice brownish redish coffee ground style sludge... And a lot of it\n\n-- Bright purple/pinkish urine, or dark brown/black urine that is always abnormally foamy and has a white subatance settle at the bottom\n\n-- Thick, almost jello consistency / rubbery consistency phlegm. When I cough up stuff I could literally chew it if I wanted like a piece of meat or gum or roll it into a ball in my fingers. The mucous/phlegm is usually yellow, brown or blackish \n\n-- Shortness of breath\n\n-- Heart racing, gets worse with even mild excersize, and episodes of fainting due to standing or switching position too quickly\n\n-- Hearing imparment from very young/birth in left ear & total inability to smell\n\n-- Vision loss getting progressively worse\n\n-- Metallic taste in mouth\n\n-- Massive & excruciatingly painful hematomas / fluid under skin even after very minor injuries\n\n-- Superhuman metabolic rate... Always been very thin really, despite for years now I have eatten almost 10000 calories a day. That\'s right... Not 1000... ten thousand calories a day! Definitely over 5 thousand, and I have never been able to gain weight except one short period of my life and I could not identify why I was able to put on weight at that time. In recent months I have given up my extreme eating habit as it seems to have no effect on my nutrition or ability to be healthy, amd probably consume from 2000 to 4000 cal a day and have plateaued where I do not gain weight but am also not losing weight anymore\n\n-- Dental problems, early extractions etc despite being born with ""perfect teeth"" and taking care of them\n\n-- Flank pain made worse by eating, made better after pooing\n\n-- Sparse, thick, coarse hair everywhere except head, pubic area. Those 2 areas have more normal feeling hair and its denser there. Hair grows slowly everywhere except those 2 areas. If you shave my leg it will grow back over months but if you shave my head I\'ll have a full head of hair in a few weeks. \n\n-- Brittle, fast growing nails & deformed baby toenail on each foot (mother has the same issue with baby toes on each of her feet)\n\n-- Chest pain, back pain, bone pain, muscle pain\n\n-- Muscle spasms so severe they cause my fingers / toes to twist all weird and lock themselves up. Think of the foot cramp after swimming but your entire leg, arm, hand or foot & it happens at random when you move or use a muscle or muscle group\n\n-- Sudden, temporary lower limb paralysis documented at least 4 times by my medical records\n\n-- Sensitive to cold\n\n-- Nose bleeds\n\n-- Drenching night sweats\n\nNervous system / pain receptor defect... A  wound on finger causes pain in ribs, back or leg for example. Especially when the wound is touched while healing. Another example is; wound on my leg will hurt and cause the same pain happening in that area, but in my abdominal area, or arms as well \n\n-- Easy bruising, bone breaks, slow healing \n\n-- Ridiculous / out of proportion strength or ability to harness adrenaline? At my sickest point in recent times I was still able to lift a 350 to 450 pound object up multiple flights of stairs, being the only person on one side and the other side needing 3 or 4 men much larger than myself and they could hardly do it. This isn\'t the only example of my strength being out of proportion to what I SHOULD be capable of especially given my physical condition, but it is the most obvious example\n\nAnd many many more physical issues. Those above are the most serious / worrisome though.\n\n\nDiagnosis\' \n\n- Omphalocele\n\n- Hypospadias\n\n- Osteoporosis & Osteoarthritis\n\n- Vertebral degeneration\n\n- Skeletal defects = feet, knees, shoulders (winged scapula), spine (Kyphoscoliosis)\n\n- 18mm tumor in spinal column ""likely hemangioma""\n\n- Adenoid hypertrophy\n\n- Upper Motor Neuron Disease\n\n- Raynauds Disease \n\n- 30+ Allergies including one to antibiotic ""Biaxin"" or ""Bioxin""\n\n- Asthma (Lung function tests said this needs reinvestigation)\n\n- Rare Ectopic Rhythm\n\n- Arrhythmias\n\n- Biatrial Enlargement of Heart\n\n- Myocardial Infarction\n\n- Arthralgia / Myalgia\n\n- Stiffness & Pain\n\n- Hoffman sign\n\n- Babinski sign\n\n- Hyperreflexia \n\n- Swollen lymph nodes, getting bigger, for 4 years\n\n- Cyst in scrotum & Brain\n\n- severe Palmoplantar Hyperkeratosis (or a kind of Itchyosis, hard to say without concrete testing)\n\nMy best theory & my doctor agrees, although again he admits deep down he is stumped by my case, is a rare subtype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with MCAS, POTS & Porphyria, or possibly some kind of genetic autoimmune blistering disease with atypical presentation, maybe attached to a multiple autoimmune / polyendocrine disease. but these and other similar theories doesn\'t explain everything as far as I am aware\n\n\nThis has already been long enough, but if\nyou\'ve heard of medical mysteries that match whats described here, or if you know of an institution or doctor anywhere in the world that can help me and save my life, please do reach out in this thread or privately or both. \n\nTomorrow I will post pictures of my physically visible symptoms so you can actually see some of what I am talking about (still havent figured out best way or would have done by now)'"

The first says just to keep taking NSAIDs and start physical rehabilitation as soon as I feel better. \n2. The second suggests quite a pricy treatment including dry needling, hight intensity magnetic and laser therapy, and plasma injections. All these must help with reducing the pain and resorbing the bulge. \n3. The third offered an epidural steroid injection with X-ray control to resolve the inflammation and swelling locally.  And if it does not help me, trying radiofrequency ablation and modulation of the nerve to stop pain signals to the brain. \n\nThe first option is the cheapest and the easiest but I have been taking NSAIDs for a while, and my pain does not seem to go away, and it worsens if I skip a pill. The second option seems a bit weird since dry needling is associated with muscle pain, and in my case, muscles are not involved as much as the nerve. Laser therapy seems legit, and I have found less info on the magnetic one. The third option seems quite invasive and scary. \n\nBut I need to chose the way to go. \n\nWhich of these options have you tried and what would you choose?'"

Please help',,"b'Ive been suffering for a couple of years now. My symptoms have been very odd. Some symptoms have came and went and may be unrelated. I feel like something was triggered when I had all the craziness going on after a surgery. Ive had some things for years but things really started accelerating after an L4-L5 discectomy and laminotomy. I dont know what is related and what isnt. I had really strange symptoms including nightly fevers for a while and was tested throughly- oncologist, rheumatologist, infectious disease specialist. I feel like they were very thorough. They did all the relevant blood work. I have worried about fibromyalgia because I know it would not have shown up on the test. I know there are also several other auto immune diseases that can possibly not show up or take a long time.  They found a few small anomalies like liver enzymes imbalances, but nothing to get any diagnosis. My primary care provider kind of threw her hands up and said maybe your dealing with some weird viral thing. I became a little paranoid after my hospital stay after surgery because there were two rooms across from me that had people with some unknown infectious disease where they had security on their door where you had to have a key pass to enter and the healthcare people who went in had fill hazmat suits on.

Symptoms continued for another 2 weeks and then mystically disappeared.\n\nFlash forward 3 months later, it's now late summer and one night I start having symptoms again. Congested nose, post nasal drip, difficulty breathing like I've breathed in smoke or something, itchiness, aches in jaws, arms and legs. But like previous time, only at night. When I wake up in the morning and during the day I feel mostly normal, however I also feel lightheaded and every time I stand up my heart works in overdrive and then calms down after a minute or so.\n\nThis continues for another 2-3 weeks and then disappear again. \n\nFlash forward to 3 days ago, the exact same symptoms appear again late at night!!! It's exactly the same. Congested nose, difficulty breathing, post nasal drip, itchiness, red rash, tiredness, aches etc. And this time it follows the same exact cycle as previously -> symptoms appear at night -> symptoms go away during the day, only feel extra tired -> symptoms come back at night.\n\nOne thing I've managed to put together is that all these symptoms are appearing just right before I'm about to have my period. They start 3-4 days before my period and then continue for 2-3 weeks and then disappear.\n\nI've been using Allegra + nasal spray and it hasn't relieved my symptoms which makes me believe this isn't allergy related. Surely a dose of antihistamine + corticosteroid would have taken care of it?"""

Bit of a weird one - will be long but might be of professional interest to dentists so I wont try to edit too much. \n\nAn appointment with paediatric dentistry at our local hospital appointment is upcoming and Im posting here to try and formulate useful questions to ask at the appointment rather than hoping for definitive answers.\n\nProblem: My daughter is 10 and a half and seems to have multiple additional teeth, top and bottom, both at the front of the mouth and at the rear. \n\nAt least one is completely erupted, another partially erupted. So far they look fairly well formed and much like the teeth they are beside. \n\nShe also has multiple areas in the gum that have that strained skin look with what appears to be white bumps behind. I suspect she has at least 5 extra teeth, perhaps more. \nHer adult teeth are looking crowded and she is complaining of pain, which seems to be a combo of normal eruption pain plus pressure on neighbouring teeth.\n\nHer older half brother (21) had one additional tooth that was little and malformed and was extracted before he had a brace fitted - no big deal.\n\nBackground: My daughter has an extremely complicated medical history, having been diagnosed with a rare life threatening immune disorder ([secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis triggered by EBV - Epstein Barr virus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5766650/)) just before her 7th birthday. \nThe hospital dental department initially saw her while in paediatric ICU - this was purely because (like all 6 year olds) she had several wobbly teeth - these were dentist-extracted to avoid any safety issues while she was sedated and reliant on mechanical ventilation via a throat tube. Purely practical stuff, but its why shes already on the hospital dental teams books.\n\nMy daughters main doctor is a haematologist/oncologist (HLH isnt technically cancer but its grouped with cancer for treatment/research/charity purposes and the drugs initially used to treat it are also used for some forms of childhood leukaemia) but shes also seen a consultant immunologist and professor in immunogentics. Shes had blood tests for [exome sequencing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exome_sequencing) and no obvious genetic reason has yet been found for her catastrophic reaction to the usually pretty mild EBV. Some results are still outstanding due to covid dominating the specialist laboratory provision - shes no longer a priority patient due to having achieved remission at the end of 2019.\n\nThroughout covid my daughter has been considered extremely clinically vulnerable and has been kept in isolation. She hasnt seen a dentist since spring 2020 - (shes now had covid, sailed through it and is keen to join the real world).\n\nWe had a phone call triage with a registrar from the hospital dental team a few days ago and have been called in for a face to face with a department consultant.\n\nMy questions for you, dentists of Reddit (or at least the few of you who have had time to read this!)are:\n\n1.When/how do supernumerary teeth form? \nMy daughter has had a head CT scan and two MRI scans, plus a dental x Ray and nothing has been brought to my attention (whereas I knew to expect my son to eventually need braces via dental x rays from when he was around 4/5 years of age) is it possible that supernumerary teeth are formed spontaneously at a much later date than primary/secondary teeth?\n\n2. Could this be related to the drugs used to put her HLH in remission? She had massive doses of corticosteroid drug Dexamethasone plus cytotoxic chemotherapy drug Etoposide and calcineurin inhibitor, Cyclosporine (most often used for organ transplant patients). I know cyclosporine can cause overgrowth of gums but this was not a side effect my daughter experienced (she did, however, develop excessive facial and body hair growth, aka hirsutism, and developed Cushings syndrome as a side of the steroid)\n\n3. Is it possible that there is an underlying condition that connects both the hyperdontia and the HLH? I have read that Ehlers Danlos patients can have one or other and my daughter is ridiculously bendy (hypermobile?) but having been assessed by a respected immunologist and having had some genetic testing I wouldve expected potential connective tissue disorders to to have come up by now?\n\n4. How likely is it that its just poor luck to have loads of extra teeth and a life threatening rare illness and there are no connections between them?\n\n5. If my daughter turned up in your practice what further tests or diagnostic imaging would you commission? \nWhat is your standard approach to supernumerary teeth and would you proceed as normal with a child with a complicated medical history? \n\nAnything else I should be thinking about?\n\n\nApart from the teeth and ongoing PTSD type symptoms my daughter is doing brilliantly, has never relapsed and still sees her haematologist for 6 monthly check ups. \nWere beyond grateful to our entire hospital team from cleaners to consultants and Im sure well have ongoing excellent care from the hospital dental team. \n\n\nIm asking here simply to cast a wide net as HLH is rare and doesnt really properly belong to any medical specialism (its an orphan disease affecting white blood cells, which in turn damages red cells, hence us seeing both a haematologist and an immunologist) and if this dental issue is a rare symptom of a rare orphan, or an unusual side effect from treating that rare orphan, I might not find a HCP who has come across it in my own region!\n\nThanks for reading and in advance for any answers or pointers you have.'"

Yes, I'm fun at parties. \n\nSo I'm gonna channel my ADHD bluntness and just say this:\n\n DON'T PUT OFF GETTING SUPPLIES\n\nFor 99% of people, getting infected might be a mild inconvenient flu. But for elderly or sick people, this is potentially very dangerous and since this is novel, there is no herd immunity to protect them.\n\nHere's my quick and dirty list to help you, check other sites for more complete emergency preparedness lists:\n\n-!Prescription meds (top of the list because supply chain disruptions are very possible) \n\n-Flu meds (flu with congestion/phlem you DONT want to suppress cough, but rather break up the mucus in the lungs, and make coughing easier)\n\n-Other household meds (acetaminophen, diarrhea meds)\n\n-Tissues\n\n-Toilet Paper\n\n-disinfectant (bleach, wipes, hand soap)\n\n-menstruation products\n\nFood stuff:\n\n-peanut butter\n\n-honey\n\n-powdered milk\n\n-rice\n\n-beans \n\n-oats, quinoa \n\n-broth stock (useful w/ flu to help drink warm broth)\n\n-comfort food (in case of emergency, treat yo' self!)\n\n-crackers\n\n-coffee/tea\n\nYou don't need to go out and buy everything today, but over the next few weeks, start picking up a few items and putting them aside. Don't leave them out for you to absentmindedly use out of sight out of mind. \n\n*Please don't hoard.* It actually makes the situation worse for everyone. I want people to get just what they need for their family for one month, and that's it. If we need to self-quarantine, no one wants people in the streets looking for TP because people got greedy, thus keeps spreading.\n\nAlso, one last thingbe kind to each other and remember that for a lot of healthcare workers, retail people and others dealing with the public this is not pleasant. They are worried for their own health and safety so please consider them in all this.\n\nEdit: more information is coming out regarding what can help with symptoms and recovery. I'm getting my information from a virologist and my nurse spouse so I'm revising information to help you treat yourself at home.\n\nFor fever:  NSAIDs like ibuprofen are not reccomended because it reduces inflammation and might dampen your immunoresponseacetamenophen/paracetamol is okay. You want to manage your fever but not suppress itfevers are what stops viruses from multiplying in your body, symptoms become worse as viral load increases. \n\nIf you have a cough, a humidifier or a shower may help ease it as humid air is easier on your lungs. Gargle salt water for a sore throat, and honey to soothe. \n\nIf you live in the northern hemisphere, you may be vitamin D deficient due to lack of sun and low levels of UVB light over winter. Vitamin D is essential for a strong immune system and helps fight viral infections. While in quarantine, try to at least sit outside for 15-20 minutes in the sun if it's warm enough."""

On March 27 I underwent a laminotomy (hemilaminectomy) with decompression of nerve roots, including partial facetectomy, forminotomy and/or excision of herniated intervertebral disc; 1 interspace, lumbar. When I go for my followup on April 14, Ill be able to ask him just exactly what that means hahaha. By the way, eight days out, Im really happy I did it.\n\n**INFO FOR WOMEN**\n\nThought to put this up here so it wouldnt get buried: I ended up getting my period two days before the surgery. The timing sucked, but having it fall when it did was definitely doable and nothing to stress over. Just let the nurses know you have your period; theyll give you cotton underwear and a pad to wear during the surgery. Just bring some overnight pads to put on your underwear once youre clear to change and go home, post-op. The nurses will help you put them in place if you ask (which you should). It isnt nearly as embarrassing a thing to ask as you think. Related note: The nurses told me not to wear tampons after surgery. Even if I wanted to, there was no way I was going to be able to finagle that thing up there (its hard to bend forward a little/you of course dont *want* to bend forward). Pads are the way to go, for sure.\n\n\n**DAYS BEFORE**\n\nCouldn't eat or drink anything -- even water -- after midnight the day before my surgery. Also, youre not supposed to take any meds 10 days before the surgery. It sucked, because thats seemingly when my entire body started aching hahaha (headache, PMS cramps, back/leg pain, etc.). Go grocery shopping with someone if you can. Theyre good to bounce ideas off of. I bought small bottles of milk, boxes of orange juice, pasta, crackers  basically things I could keep at countertop level/things that werent super heavy. I also made sure to place everything Id need in short reaching distance. And any clothes I might want to change into, I put on the end of my bed.\n\nI also bought one of those grabber things that are sold at medical supply stores (which has become my best friend since the surgery haha); a shoehorn if I need it; and my grandma sent me one of those things that help people who cant bed over get socks on. I tried that sucker out a few days before surgery and I recommend it. But back to the grabber  I assumed I wasnt going to want to reach forward very far after surgery (I was spot on with that one). This thing helped immensely.\n\nInitially, I was all set to recover in my third-floor walk-up apartment (I have a seriously wonderful  roommate, but shed be at work until at least 5 p.m. each day). Friends who work very close to where they live kept offering to allow me to stay in their place (which had an elevator) because they could check on me throughout the day/keep an eye on me at night, but I didnt want to put them out. Id be sleeping in their bed and relegating them to their couch, after all. But listen to me: If people are willing to have you crash at their place for a few days, do it. I will go into the reasons below. But please, please, please, if you can make arrangements to stay with people, suck up your pride and do it. I know its hard (it was for me to relent, at least). Recovery isnt impossible alone, but having people there to help you is incredibly amazing.\n\n**DAY OF**\n\nI was scheduled as my surgeons last patient of the day. I was supposed to go under around 2:30 p.m., but didnt end up under the knife until about 5 p.m. It literally is one of those go to bed but wake up immediately after like nothing happened situations. Before surgery, my surgeon told me his portion would take about an hour and a half. Anesthesia was scheduled to take about an hour pre-op. By the time I was done and in the recovery area, I believe it was around 7 or 7:30 p.m. \n\nI was in and out of it for a few hours after. The nurses told me Id need to pee before leaving. They also said if I couldnt pee myself, theyd have to catheterize me. Well if that didnt get me moving\n\nGetting out of bed was probably my biggest worry, pre-op. I knew how to log roll, but I was (and remain, even a little more than a week out) petrified Im going to twist and undo everything. The nurses kind of minimized the fear for me. Getting up is OK. The nurses will help you, and will also walk you to the bathroom. Youll (hopefully) notice your lack of sciatica in this moment. I did, and it was amazing. Also, it took me what felt like 10 minutes (but was probably like 3 minutes) to get all the pee out. \n\nI was given something with fentanyl twice immediately after surgery, then eventually given something with valium, then, upon release, was given small doses of oxy. Even then, I was in some fair amount of discomfort. I wouldnt say I was in pain, but it was a mix of like a locked-up feeling, pressure, and some soreness. Getting into my friends car was tough, but OK. Getting to their apartment was fine. You just need to move gingerly.\n\n\n**DAYS AFTER**\n\nI wasnt able to sleep for the first 36 hours, post-op. Not sure why. I wasnt in agony or anything like that. In fact, across my lower back was just a feeling of pressure/soreness/stiffness, but nothing extreme at all. I guess I was just wired? I also didn't have an appetite, though I tried to eat anyway. This is where I got into trouble, and why I was happy to be with folks. I received two prescriptions for pain meds: Tylenol with codeine and tramadol. The tylenol wasnt doing enough for me  it was helping, but I felt I needed more  so I waited six hours from my last dose of tylenol, and I took a tramadol after eating some meatballs. Long story short, I threw up. All over myself and my friends floor. I guess my body couldnt handle 50mg of tramadol. If I had been alone, I wouldnt have been able to clean up any of it. It was awful for me, and probably more traumatic for my hero friends.\nThe stiffness/soreness truly does let up day after day. The first day after surgery, Id get up every four hours or so and just slowly shuffle around for as long as I could take it  around 15 to 25 minutes  then Id go back to the bed. Each day, I was able to get up more and move around for longer, albeit carefully. I stayed with my friends for three nights and four days. On that fourth day, I walked around the halls of their building, and practiced going up a stair or two. That night, I was able to return to my third-floor walk-up. I took the stairs veryyyy carefully, but was able to climb them no problem. It took me about 10 or 15 minutes, but I got to my door without immense pain.\n\nSince then, its gotten better. Im getting random twinges of burning down my leg, but its not holding me back like it did all these months. My ankle still burns, and sometimes my hip/hamstring get that familiar, though far lesser, pain, but its not like before. I hope/assume thats normal. Im just in such a better state than I was before. I didnt get my full appetite back until about five days post-op. I didnt do a great job hydrating myself the first three days. I just didnt feel like drinking water. Do a better job than I did. \n\nI took one week completely off of work, and set it up so I could work from home the following week. Im fortunate to have bosses that allow that. They tell me I can take more time from home if I need it. I havent decided if Ill return to the office next week or not. \n\n\n**THINGS I LEARNED**\n\n- Its worth it. Hands down. Price be damned (waiting on the final bill, assuming its going to be hefty, even with insurance).\n\n- Breathe whenever youre getting up/down/walking around. Seriously, dont hold your breath. A nurse told me this when I was in the hospital. And he was right  any time I held my breath trying to get up from bed it hurt a lot more, because I was tensing up.\n\n- Bendy straws, or just straws in general, are specTACular. Invest in some.\n\n-Get ready to be a little grungey. I wasn't allowed to shower until five days after my surgery. I won't lie, I was a little greasy lookin'. But when you can finally wash yourself -- hot damn.\n\n- Post-op, if you have even an inkling you might need to pee, get up and start shufflin' towards that toilet because it might take you longer than you think to get to it. If you wait until you deffff know you need to pee, it's going to be tough. You can't speedwalk to the bathroom, and you need to take your time sitting down on the toilet, especially after surgery. Hahaha the number of times I felt like I was going to pee myself because I didn't get up in time. Fantastic.\n\n- Bring your phone with you everywhere around the house/apartment/wherever. Just in case you need something immediately, or you fall, or you can't get up from a seated position (this one happened to me when I was sitting at my friend's table). Hahaha felt a lil' pathetic, but you can't help it sometimes!!\n\n- Let the surgeon/nurses know if you cant swallow pills. I somehow forgot to mention it until like 15 minutes before being rolled to the O.R. The surgeon was able to get me the tylenol with codeine in liquid form, which I cant tell you how much I appreciated.\n\n- I really cant recommend the grabber enough. It has helped me get things out of the fridge, pick up my clothes, helped me get dressed. Seriously, consider getting one before you go under. Mine is about 30 inches long with little suction cups at the end.\n\n- **Just because you feel better, doesnt mean you are completely healed.** Im now eight days post-op, and the soreness and stiffness has subsided quite a bit. Its now to a point that I need to consciously remind myself to continue to log roll in and out of bed, and go slow when sitting down and standing up.\n\n- Get comfortable with the fact that you need to go slow and treat yourself delicately for the first few weeks. I have trouble asking people for help. I had to get over that with this whole thing. Its hard, but its in your best interest.\n\nIf anyone has any question, please feel free to reach out! These are all just from my experience  everyones experience will be different."""

After a fever, I developed itchy and irritating palm rashes (I'm guessing from my research) on the palms of my hands and soles of my feet. I've had hives from apparent allergies before but they usually weren't red and they'd patch up along my arms and legs, not soles of my feet and palms of my hands. I do not have a history of eczema. \n\nAnother thing is that I've been in remission for JRA for 10 years and had a scary thought I was relapsing because it felt like my fingertip joints and toes were boiling. However, the pain isn't as intense (though it could eventually get there) and I never developed these red spots over my soles and palms; it was rashes along my knees and arms. \n\nDay 1: I had a fever with migraines, sore throat, and fatigue throughout the day. Barely ate anything so had a loss of apetite than usual. I took Advil but woke up frequently throughout the night because of small discomfort in my hands and feet. \n\nDay 2: Fever went away, but my throat felt like there's a lump in it. Swallowing liquid and any type of food hurt but I didn't have much of an appetite anyway. Overtime throughout the day, the joint tips of my fingers started to feel a bit of pain and noticed two red dots on my palms. I was itching but I wasn't terribly itchy as I do with hives. \n\nDay 3 (Today): Same as day 3 but much worse! My hands and feet feel like they're on fire (mildly itchy but as if they need attention) -- more red bumps have formed. I can't sleep because my feet become overwhelmingly sweaty.

anticonvulsant vomit,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/758w6s/newly_diagnosed_also_have_chronic_illness/,"b'Newly diagnosed, also have chronic illness'",,"b'So, this is a long, overwhelming story and I am sorry for that. I had been taking Seroquel, usually 100mg, sometimes up to 200mg, for years to manage, in my head, mainly insomnia and chronic weight loss/malabsorption, for maybe ten years. I was suddenly diagnosed this year as borderline diabetic by my endocrinologist (I have massive overall health issues due to a benign brain lesion) caused by stress. I was about 99 lbs at 5\'5"", lifelong vegetarian, former yoga instructor, never drank soda...I actually studied diabetes in graduate school and never thought it could happen to me.\n\nSo I had to stop that suddenly. I wasn\'t on any other psych meds at the time (primary diagnosis is PTSD, secondary SAD/depression) and I went into a state that vaguely resembled the two periods I went into crisis in the past - when I was on super high doses of SSRIs. This appears to be a mixed state. Only by removing the Seroquel, which I\'d been taking since like age 20, did the Bipolar 2 reveal itself.\n\nA lot makes sense now about my behavior, but I never thought I had such a strong biological issue. My sister has pretty severe, classic OCD since age 7, she\'s successfully managing it. Father is lifelong addict and there\'s so many addicts in the family, I wouldn\'t know if anyone else is bipolar. No one else is diabetic.\n\nI have lost almost all my relationships (friends, family) due to being too sick to have a social life like my peers, and the periods of hypomania and aggression that messed up everything. I am really unsure what to do. I meditate daily, I have very bad insurance but I am trying to find a psychologist. I finally, reluctantly started Latuda after Lithium was a bust. I cannot take lamotrigine as I would be on too many anticonvulsants at once, and when the neurologists have done that in the past to prevent pain, I become too stupid to work or function. \n\nI am a super high achiever in work and academics. But these disorders are draining everything out of me. I do not know anyone as a friend who has mental illness this severe, except one friend who is pregnant (I will not burden her at this time; she has severe depression, well managed with meds) and another who also has lupus (severe ADHD and OCD) and does not deserve to always have to pick me up when I don\'t know how she does it herself.\n\nMy main issue right now is I. Cannot. Focus. On anything that isn\'t like racing physical hyper task, which I\'m not even supposed to do because I\'m 5\'5 and 94 lbs, and the doctors do not want me active until I am in the triple digits. Never been above 115. All day I struggle with different symptoms and try to manage my blood sugar, mood, headaches, vomiting, GI issues, muscle spasticity, and I am starting to feel like a hungry ghost instead of a person. And I chain smoke and hate myself for it; I started at 14.\n\nI am sorry this is so long. I also work in a profession where it would be damning for this to be discovered about me. It is bad enough about the tumor. I do not want to feel like my life...like I never got a chance to live it. \n\nI\'m single, live far from friends and have trouble driving, and I constantly want a hug. It\'s pathetic. I\'m sleeping cuddling with my childhood stuffed animal and my real dog, too. I think I will always be alone. \n\nThank you to anyone who read this nonsense. '"

Fast forward to recently it's still there, I visit the doctor for a unrelated issue and mention the leg and back pains. The doctor said it sounded like sciatica and prescribed some pain medication. In the end I didnt grab them from the pharmacy due to the pain being minimal. It was just an inconvenience. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, woke up as per normal, had a shower then I was drying myself I raised my left leg onto our bedroom couch and in that split second an immense indescribable amount of pain got sent through my entire body. It felt like someone had stabbed me or shot me in my lower back. Suddenly the feeling in my left leg and lower back was multiplied by 1000x.\n\nI called the emergency services, and they told me to call my gp, called him and he thought it may be was a muscle spasm. Prescribed some codeine and referred me to the physio service which takes 4 days to do so. \n\nSince yesterday I have barely been able to walk without excruciating pain, extreme difficulty going for a wee (takes around 2-5 minutes for it to start) and have been in so much discomfort its left me bed bound. This morning I went for a number 2 and it took me 30 minutes of trying, the more I pushed the more painful it was. I dont think I was able to 'fully' go. I had wind trapped in my stomach all night from being unable to pass it unless I really push. I'm concerned soon I may have bad constipation. \n\nI've called the doctor again today because I'm really worried. From my research I feel like I experienced my disc herniated or the disc slipped in this single instance. The pain runs severely from my lower back all the through my left leg to my foot. \n\nMy question to you guys, what does it sound like to you? I'm not one to self diagnose but I feel like if I know I can describe the pain better to a specialist.\n\nIs a muscle cramp the same as a herniated disc (assuming not). Why was I feeling pain in the area for the last 2 months now and what happened yesterday that multiplied that to a 10 on the pain level? \n\nShould I be patient and wait to feel better or push to be seen by a specialist? \n\nMany thanks, and I feel you for what you are/have gone through."""
corticosteroid problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/ddmzrk/put_me_out_of_my_misery/,b'Put me out of my misery!',,"b""NOTE: IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ THE WHOLE THING SKIP TO 3. ONWARDS\n1. THE LEAD UP:\nMy sciatica story started all the way back around December 2018. It was the end of high school (my age was 17 years 10 months) and I wanted to focus on my deadlifting. I had been deadlifting since mid 2017 and could do upto 120kgs for 3 reps no problem by around June 2018. Due to all the work during my final year of high school I went from doing deadlifts roughly twice a week to around once every 2 weeks lifting at 120 kgs max. I suspect that my form was slowly getting poorer over time as I kept overlooking my flaws in lifting technique.\n\nEarly December 2018, school was done and I increases my lifting frequency to twice a week (still doing 120kgs 3 reps per set). When I started increasing the weight to 125kgs I kept dropping the barbell onto the floor (after say 2 reps) due to sweaty hands and poor grip stength. So I asked my father to buy some straps so I could grip the barbell better. \n\nI didn't try and progress through some lighter weights with the straps and went straight to 125kgs. The straps were a but loose and on the 3rd rep I dropped the barbell but alas, the straps were in the way causing me to bend forward and put the barbell down. Me being an egoistic fool, I went for another rep to see if I could improve my form but the same thing happened and a sharp pain happened in the middle of my lower back.\n\nThe pain was intense during while doing things such as bending from that day on. It calmed down after a few weeks and eventually went away (or so I thought). I started deadlifting again (January 2018) with lower weights (50 kgs) and worked on improving my form. The pain was still there but not as bad. I slowly increased the weights and by the time I went to 100kgs the pain came back and it was worse than before.\n\nSneezing (the worst), sudden movements, bending forward and occasionally coughing would make a mild and constant back pain become a agonizing misery. It was as if the left side of my lower back was collapsing on itself. I went to the physio (probably March) and he said something along the lines of a tight muscle was trying to protect the joints in my spine. He did some massaging and within hours my back pain was gone.\n\n2. THE SCIATICA AND CORTISTEROID:\nAfter a few days of my pain being gone, I noticed that when walking that there would be a mild pain down the back of my leg. Nothing too bothersome at this point and it didn't affect my lifestyle much. Within 3 days it became worse. The pain would happen while transitioning from standing to sitting or from sitting to standing (this was far more painful). The pain would run down the back of my leg and occasionally into the back of my heel. \n\nAfter 2 weeks I went back to the physio and the physio deemed it something along the lines of hamstring tendonopothy and that I should sit on pillows or stand for a week. I did so and went back to him and he said that my nerve was sensitive. He gave me a few excercises to deal with the nerve sensitivity. My father wanted a second opinion. \n\nWe went to a GP and he asked us to do an ultrasound to check for inflammation. Turns out there was some ischiogluteal bursitis according to the doctor when he checked the ultrasound. He recommended me to a different physio and suggested getting a corticosteroid injection with the help of ultrasound. \n\nWhen getting the cortisteroid injection, ultrasound wasn't used however and I was simply asked where the pain was. It was difficult to pinpoint the pain so I pointed to where the pain was the most at that moment. A week later, no improvement at all. I was also taking some anti-inflammatory pills that my GP prescribed but to no results.\n\n3. THE PHYSIO:\nThe new physio told me that my nerve was sensitive and asked me to start moving daily. After the injury began I hadn't exercised at all. He wanted me to start walking and doing things like using the elliptical I had at home. I did so for a week and I noticed that my pain would mildly reduce during the day. However the next day it would reset.\n\nMornings are the worst. The moment I get out of the bed, the pain in my leg is pure agony. Standing hurts and moving hurts as well. It calms down within an hour. I explained this to the physio. He asked me to continue with my exercises and taught me a nerve stretching exercise to do after my regular exercises. Our next appointment is next week. The time between the second visit and my next visit is 3 weeks so there's been some for me to focus on walking, using the elliptical and doing what the physio has instructed.\n\nI slowly increased my 20 minute walks to 40 minute walks. My elliptical from 10 minutes to 40 minutes. The pain calms down the most during the evenings due to the excercises. It's still there. Not mild, not agonizing like the morning pains, but reduced pain. Recently I started doing some type of pushups which requires me to lie down (back up) but to no results. Nowadays I am either standing up or lying face down on my bed.\n\nToday while I was on the toilet seat I noticed that I had very little pain (possibly none at all) which was weird since sitting hurts my sciatica. The moment I stood up, I felt a pain far more painful than ever before. I would prefer my morning pains over this. It felt like the nerve moved (it's what it felt like, hopefully not what happened). Even 2 hours later as I write this on my bed lying belly down, the pain is there when i move my leg in certain positions. Wherever and whenever I felt my sciatic pains, it has become sharper and more agonizing.\n\n4. THE POINT:\nI am not sure what to do. Lying belly down is the best position I can be in due to it causing the least amount of pain but I am a University student who is behind by weeks simply due to not being able to attend many of my classes (sitting hurts). I can not lie down forever, and the pain has decreased my overall happiness (what's left of it). My parents are extremely busy and stressed  but support me when they can but most of the day they are at work.\n\nThis pain is the worst, it's not like any other pain. No scream, yell, grunt helps ease the pain. The pain can be suffocating sometimes as I have to catch my breath when the pain gets really bad. While I am thankful for my sciatica teaching me a lesson in humility for weightlifting, the pain has gone for far too long. \n\nI don't know how long I can deal with this pain. My strength is slowly fading and so I ask this subreddit if you have any advice on how I should proceed or anything that might be useful. There's been no official diagnosis yet but my guess is that this might be due to a herniated disk or a ruptured disk."""

Well, I say ""bothering"", but it was really just something that was kinda weird and interesting--when I close my eyes, I lose all sense of proportion in my body. My head feels huge or tiny compared to my hands, my feet will feel like twigs against my legs (or vice versa), etc. etc. For some reason it\'s taken me over a decade to realize that maybe, just maybe, it\'s not a normal thing that everyone feels, so I decided to look it up.\n\nI quickly landed on the wikipedia page for Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. At first I thought that really couldn\'t be it, because everything in the wiki was pointing to it being an aura for a migraine, which I have never had in my life. But then I saw that it was also an aura for some people who have epilepsy, and it clicked with something I had discussed with my therapist some months back. \n\nFor me, Lamictal has been something of a miracle drug. 200mg/day has kept me more stable than I could have possibly hoped for over the last year. When discussing the medication itself and the effects it\'s had on me, my therapist mentioned a theory she read about and had been discussing with some colleagues about why anticonvulsants like Lamictal and  Depakote can be so incredibly effective for so many people with bipolar disorder, which pretty much boiled down to ""it kinda does the same things to certain parts of your brain as a seizure, just slower and longer"". \n\nI did more research into it back then and found a few studies on the comorbidity of epilepsy and behavioral disorders, but not really anything specifically related to bipolar disorder and its relation to epilepsy aside from one article that I couldn\'t access because i\'m too poor to pay for it. Now learning that I have this other symptom that\'s more commonly associated with epilepsy than bipolar disorder, I guess it\'s just got me wondering how many others might be experiencing something similar.\n\nTL;DR: Sometimes my feet feel tiny because brain and it might be related to epilepsy and bipolar, does it happen to you too?'"

The pain on 3000mg of Tylenol a day was about a 1-2 and I was stiff moving about but not actively painful.\n\nI walked a lot my watch clocked me at 2 miles of walking that day with about 4,500 steps its winter here so most of that was indoors around my house but Im doing 2 out door walks a day lasting 15-20m\n\nDay 8: \nI sent my wife to get a massage while I watched our 4 year old. She knows Daddy cant pick her up and cant bend over or really kneel for long to play dolls with her. There might have been more iPad watching than I like but my wife got out of the house for 3 hours and came back refreshed with a massage, haircut, and some time spent with a book and a coffee.\n\nMy daughter and I survived. Truly better than survived. Thursdays have been Daddy Bean days since she was born I have 1 day off mid week and I have stayed home with her almost every single one since she was born. Its been Thursday for the last 2 years. She and I have really missed our Daddy Bean time because in the run up to surgery I stayed home on Thursdays but it wasnt the same especially as my symptoms worsened.\n\nDay 9: \nIts Friday, my wife went out with girlfriends to see a movie. Wait lets go back a moment... I drove in a car today... wait one more second I drove the car.... \n\nFriday was a pretty impressive day. My pain has been super well controlled (almost nothing) and my stiffness is way down almost to the point of not being there. I now need to be super careful not to overdo it. My mantra of no lifting, bending, twisting is constant.\n\nSo to start the day off getting out of bed... Im still experiencing the left leg pain & cramping when getting out of bed and Im most sore in the morning. But its lasting less and less time. Its down from 2 hours to now about 20-30 minutes and far less severe. Im sleeping on my back I dont trust myself not to twist if I sleep on my side and I still use pillows to wedge myself in.\n\nAfter getting settled, coffee, etc... my wife and I decided that I could in fact go out and lunch was a good idea. She drove... driving is interesting its not comfortable, nor painful or uncomfortable its just not the same... its a thing that before was a nothing but now its a something. I cant describe it better than that. I expect it to get better though. \n\nWe had lunch together and I was able to sit down in a restaurant for the first time in 6 months. It was awesome. I did take some time to walk a bit after we ate but lunch was about 45 minutes of sitting and I did just fine. Perfect posture and no bending down to my food though. Fork to mouth instead of mouth to fork...\n\nAfterwards I drove. It took a bit to readjust car seat I had it a very particular location pre surgery to accommodate a very interesting and not particularly safe driving position. Once I had it mostly right away we went. It was strange but not good or bad. We headed to a home goods store. Generally we can both admire furniture I can admire kitchen gadgets she can ogle soap and we can both cringe at all the pink things our daughter would say she wanted and could t live without. We walked through there for 45m before heading home.\n\nLater that evening I cooked her dinner, she got out all the pots and put everything in the dishwasher but I did the cooking. After dinner she took off and I watched our daughter until bed. Bedtime was interesting the downstairs was trashed but I convinced her to help me get most of it cleaned up. I still spent more time on my knees that I should have. But we succeeded and I had the downstairs spotless by the time I went to bed a few hours after my daughter. It was a good night even if I probably over did it. Fortunately, no symptoms to suggest I hurt anything.\n\nBasically it was the most normal day Ive had in 6 months and it was 9 days after microdisectomy surgery.\n\nDay 10:\n\nNot much to report I slept in. I had little pain and less stiffness. Sleeping in hurt the walking as I had less time to do it but I walked 25 minutes today once. We had a friend over dinner and then played board games. It was again feeling like a normal day.\n\n\nSome take take aways. Im super careful not bend. I had to ask my friend to pick up a dice I dropped right next to my foot. I could have done it but the bending.... I picked up my cat he weighs about 12-15lbs I realized that was a bad idea and put him down about a minute later.\n\nMy leg feels weird. Their is rarely pain but it just feels odd weird feelings are the best way to describe it. Not tingling or numbness and definitely not pain. Its like my nerve is trying to say things but doesnt have the right words. However, it also seems like its no longer shouting for attention.\n\nI do a lot of standing and minor pacing. Its more comfortable than sitting. Also sitting I have to get up before I really get comfortable. I set a 20-30 minute alarm on my watch and get up when it goes off, never staying seated for more than an hour and if I do Im stiff and its a mistake...\n\nAs for medications:\n500mg Tylenol 4x a day\n220mg Naproxen 3x a day (the bottle says no more than 2, if you have kidney issues or any reason to not take NSAIDS be really careful exceeding the dosage on the bottle)\nDocusate Sodium/Colace 2x a day one capsule\nGabapentin 300mg 4x a day.\nDiazepam 5mg 2x a day\n\nGiven my pain is well under control Im going to taper the Tylenol down to 500mg 2-3x a day and the Naproxen 2x a day on Tuesday and see how I do. My 2 week post op is Thursday and I want to make sure my pain is resolved and not being masked by pain medications. The diazepam is for muscle spasms and since the stiffness has mostly gone away Im going to taper that down to before bed at the same time.\n\nAsks questions I might update tomorrow or it might be a few days again.'"
codeine problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/12e4d9x/terrified_to_start_taking_vyvanse/,b'Terrified to start taking Vyvanse',,"b'I (29yo f) have been prescribed 20mg of Vyvanse and am beyond terrified to take it. As soon as I open the bottle I start crying and freaking out. I had planned to take it for the first time today at 8am but it is now 11am and I am both equally as upset that I have not been able to take it as I have been pretty much freaking out over it for the last 2 hours.\n\nI think my biggest fear is of being ""high"", having weird body sensations and it also causing more anxiety. Also the fact that it\'s ""long acting"" scares me also becuase if I am having a bad time the bad time will be drawn out. Atleast if I am having a panic attack in my sober self they are kinda just made up in my brain right, so I can calm myself down where if a medication causes me to panic I can\'t just remove the medication from my body or stop it if it starts to freak me out. \n\nAlso a lot of the things I am terrified of (the covid vaccine was one, and the fact I have to get my wisdom teeth out is another) are things that I HAVE to do. Where seeing as this medication isn\'t something I HAVE to do (I\'ve been alive 29 years without right?) I am struggling to just force myself to take it. \n\nI have never taken any sort of mood disorder drugs before despite having depression since I was 15yo, anxiety my whole life but it was never a problem and never realized I had anxiety until I was about 21-23yo when I developed panic attack disorder after taking codeine (for a minor surgery I had, ended up in the ER dept thinking I was dying) as well as I had a bad trip on smoking green around 19-20 that I believe was the moment that panic attacks became a problem in my life.\n\nI largely choose therapy over medications for my mental health issue which I had great success with until covid happened as I have found it extremely hard to ""put my mask back on"" and return to ""normal life"" post covid. \n\nThis self exploration thorough out covid led to my ADHD diagnosis and subsequently the desire to try medication as I am struggling to maintain  being a member of society.  \n\nI know I am probably overthinking this massively. I over thought covid and didnt sleep at night from worrying about catching it, yet when I caught it, it sucked but I was fine.\n\nIt\'s hard to sometimes gauge how full on the side effects will be, like elevated heart rate, I can\'t find information on HOW elevated.\n\nWas anyone else this terrified and can offer some advice? \n\nOr can compare their experience to something I can quantify, like drinking coffee/energy drink?\n\n**TLDR:** First time taking any medication for anything brain/mood etc related. Extremely anxious over taking it. Need reassurance or a slap or something.'"

Right now I\'m diagnosed bipolar, but I have traits of: autism, ADHD, schizophrenia, schizoid personality disorder. There are so many mixed signs and I\'m unsure if I have anything at all, or all of it.\n\nI have sensory and social troubles, loud noises hurt in my soul and I have no idea of social cues at all and navigate social interactions based on speech alone. I can make facial expressions and change the tone I speak at. Everything social feels mechanical to me and when I\'m interacting with a new person I don\'t know how to act, I can only interact with people I\'ve known for a long time.\n\nI have horrible executive dysfunction and focusing problems. Therapist says that\'s because of bipolar disorder. I honestly don\'t know at this point. I **will not** do the same thing for more than a week, ever. Forming a habit is something extremely rare. Apart from scrolling social media, no habit stays.\n\nI have negative symptoms like anhedonia, dissociation and avolition. I have had two psychotic episodes, but with both of them, I was aware of it.\n\nI\'ve had ""hypomania"", but it all can be explained by ADHD. All my psychotic episodes did not involve a manic component, in fact I can say with certainty I was either depressed or with regular mood during them.\n\nSee how on all fronts it\'s only ""a little bit"" of everything? I feel like I shouldn\'t be taking these three meds (antidepressant, anticonvulsant, antipsychotic). But at the same time I feel like I should be taking other meds. I don\'t know how to bring this to my therapist and psychiatrist. I just wanted to express this somewhere that I knew someone was going to read. Because I\'m really at a loss. I just want to be okay and it feels like I\'m getting treated for the wrong thing.\n\nSometimes I want to quit all meds so people will see what\'s really going on. But at the same time I have a fear that quitting my meds will ***really*** make me go off the deep end. But at the same time, if I don\'t, I\'ll never know.'"

Im a little worried about my liver but Ill discuss this with the Doc.\n\nIve only got 13 days left of Accutane (hurray! - Derm decided to end my treatment a month early due to the pain being that bad and my not having any new spots for a month) so hopefully it will start to subside pretty quickly and I wont be on the codeine/ tramadol too long!\n\nI guess Im basically just wondering if this level of pain is normal and how others coped with it? I feel bad going off work for it :/\n\nHaving read through previous posts Ill definitely give some yoga/back stretches and fish oil a go, - anyone got any U.K. brand recommendations (cod liver oil makes me sick)?\n\nInfo: 60mg p/day (weight 60kg) for 3 months (once finished).\n\nTl;dr: on codeine constantly for the pain, is this normal? Any U.K. brand fish oil recommendations (not cod liver oil)?\n\nUPDATE (in case it serves anyone use in the future): the Doc said its uncommon for the pain to be so bad that the max strength co-codamol doesnt shift it. Shes put me on tramadol and told me to call my Derm to see if I need to stop the Accutane immediately in case theres risk of permanent damage. Will update with Derms response.\n\nSECOND UPDATE (again in case it helps someone in the future): Derm has reassured me theres no risk of permanent damage but has advised I stop taking the Isotretinoin as the Tramadol comes with its own problems. Doctors also booked me for physio to help with the joint pain.\n\nTHIRD UPDATE: Its been 7-8 weeks since I took my last Accutane, Im still on Tramadol (plus anti-sickness) and attending physio for my back pain but my ankle pain has now completely gone! Pain free and full functionality regained! :)\n\nMy back is taking longer to heal, it feels like its been forever and its a slow painful journey but Im hopeful between my physio, some gentle yoga and fish oil that itll eventually get there :)\n\nFOURTH UPDATE: After a whole lotta time, physio and pain killers. Turns out Im deficient in Vitamin D which can cause bone/ joint pain! Makes sense to be deficient since the Accutane required me to cover up/stay out of the sun and then entering winter as I finished my course. Im taking a LOT of vit D to bring my levels up to adequate/ optimal but after only a week of taking it Im already noticing a substantial improvement!

NSAID problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/rxlpd8/ibuprofen_nsaid_allergy_and_testing/,"b'Ibuprofen, NSAID allergy and testing?'",,"b""In summer 2020 I took extra strength Advil for a bad headache and I'm 99% sure I had an allergic reaction to it because I don't remember consuming anything else out of the ordinary. Prior, I've never had allergies (in my 20s now) though I did have a whole body hive reaction to some unknown cause around 10 years ago. I've taken a lot of Motrin in my childhood and I'm pretty sure I've taken Advil too, though I'd say as I grew older I rarely took anything for pain unless it was sickness-related in which I'd take Tylenol. I have used Voltaren emugel, the NSAID 'cream' for muscle pain, decently often.\n\nAnyways that day, I developed a stuffy and runny nose, sneezing, and started to feel cold. I thought it was just cold symptoms or something to do with the fact that I also wasn't well-rested. That was until my nose got really stuffy and runny fast in addition to it feeling like I had a lump in my throat when I swallowed which I couldn't tell if it was from me panicking, or my throat was actually tightening or both... I then realized I was having an allergic reaction (around 45 min after I had consumed Advil) and took Reactine which calmed everything down in the next hour or 2.\n\nCalled my family doctor who told me I had an anaphylactic reaction and to just stay away from Advil which was very probably the cause (or the coating on it). But also, I've used Voltaren on myself after this with no problem and she said then I can use that as an alternative. I also asked my doctor if I could be referred to do some allergy tests to fully confirm this but she said there's no test for this?\n\nI can't tell if I'm allergic to just Advil or all NSAIDs and if I'm only allergic to specific use routes. Since this is my first allergy too, it's been making me paranoid on and off to not know the exact cause of what happened especially since the reaction wasn't mild. Does anyone have a similar experience/know if it's possible for me to pinpoint with testing? It's come up again as a concern since I'm starting an oral pill medical treatment soon which could cause pains as a side effect but Tylenol shouldn't be used due to the added liver stress - planning ahead here just brought up a prior paranoia to light.\n\nAny insight is greatly appreciated!"""
NSAID problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/3dizuh/my_dentist_told_me_im_clenching_my_jaw_heres_what/,"b""My dentist told me I'm clenching my jaw. Here's what we did next.""",,"b'I was going to call this post ""Fun With Bruxism"", but that didn\'t seem like a very descriptive subject line.\n\n**tl;dr** - bruxism (jaw clenching) is a possible side effect of stimulants. It can show up as a head and neck/shoulder pain, and you might not have any pain in your jaw or even notice that youre clenching your teeth (at least at first.) If youre having headaches and neck pain a lot, talk to your dentist and to the doctor who  prescribes your ADHD meds about the possibility that you\'re clenching your jaw. If you\'re having persistent pain in your jaw, **get yourself to a dentist ASAP**. This symptom has a lot of possible causes, and none of them are things you want to mess around with. \n\nLast week I started having some pretty bad pain in my jaw near my back teeth. My first assumption was that my wisdom teeth were coming in, so I went in to see my dentist. He poked around in my mouth, moved my jaw in different ways and noticed it was making a slight clicking noise, and said that its probably bruxism. He gave me a list of instructions for how to treat it on my own, and told me to call him in two weeks and let him know how it went.\n\nThe thing I want to emphasize is that up until this happened, I wasnt aware that I was clenching my jaw at all. I tend to get headaches in the afternoon, and before now I just assumed that it was my medication wearing off, but right around the time my jaw started hurting they got a lot worse (to the point that Aleve + Tylenol barely took the edge off) and starting showing up around the clock. It turns out that [tension in your jaw can cause headaches](http://www.migrainetrust.org/factsheet-jaw-tension-in-migraine-and-headaches-10889), as well as pain in your neck and shoulders (two other things Ive had problems with, and which Id previously attributed to working at a computer all day.)\n\nBelow are the home treatment suggestions my dentist gave me to follow for the next two weeks. Most of them are pretty non-invasive and safe, but if you have *any* questions about anything, ask your dentist and/or your doctor.\n\n1. **Keep your teeth apart.** If your teeth arent touching then they cant clench. This is simple but not easy - Id gotten used to holding my teeth together by default, and forcing my muscles to do something they werent used to was pretty painful (but the next two steps helped with this). If you have any questions about proper jaw posture, ask your dentist.\n2. **Use warm wet compresses on your jaw.** A paper towel run under a warm faucet is just fine.My dentist recommended doing this for about five minutes as often as possible, up to once an hour during the day if need be. Ive been doing it every couple of hours during work breaks.\n3. **Take over-the-counter anti-inflammatory meds.** Specifically, Im supposed to take them consistently (so that its always in my system) for at least two weeks, even if my jaw isnt hurting. This is something you definitely should **discuss with your doctor before you try it**, because using NSAIDs on the regular carries its own risks.\n4. **Dont open your mouth any wider than your thumb**. The way my dentist explained it, opening your mouth wide causes your jaw muscles to tense, and were trying to keep them from doing that as much as possible for a while. This may not be necessary or helpful for everyone  - ask your dentist.\n5. **Eat soft-ish food in bite-sized pieces.** Related to the above, my food has to be smaller that my thumb. Im also supposed to avoid biting down and tearing food with my teeth as much as possible. This means no crusty bread or raw veggies, no chewing gum, no tough meats/meat-like things (which I mention because Im a vegetarian), and I have to be the snooty asshole who eats his pizza with a knife and fork for a while. Its annoying, but its all to give my jaw muscles a break. As with step #4, this might be overkill for some people. **Ask your dentist**.\n6. **Sleep on your back if you can.** Other positions can force your teeth together, which is exactly what we dont want. This was definitely the worst one for me, but it also seemed to help a lot. I managed to get through all of last night without flipping over. Even though it was really uncomfortable and Im pretty sure I got less actual sleep than when Im on my side, I *still* felt a lot better and more rested than I normally do. If youve got issues with sleep apnea or something else that makes it difficult to sleep on your back, **talk to your doctor**.\n\nI cannot overemphasize that you should **talk to your doctor and/or dentist** if you think youre having this problem. Im only describing my own case and whats worked for me. So far Im seeing some pretty solid improvement with the above measures, but you may not need to do everything Im doing, or you may need to do other things like adjust your medication or wear a night guard. I cant answer questions about what degree and type of treatment will be necessary or helpful for you. '"
NSAID problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/132odbx/do_i_need_help/,b'Do I need help?',,"b""So I contemplating if I should get therapy. I don't think so for a few reasons and do believe that I have some mental illness/disorders. I think I have depression, social anxiety or general anxiety, and I pretty sure I have schizoid personality disorder. I also have trichotillomania which is some form of ocd. I also forgot to add I might have substance use disorder or just dependent.\n\nStarted noticing that I've really haven't been happy or in a good mood since 2017 but have become worse and felt i haven't been in a happy mood more than 2 days a week since like 2021. At best feeling neutral for a whole week. I offten have low energy and have very bad insomnia and melatonin doesn't work for me. Then time to time I feel worthless and have suicidal ideation at least 3 or 4 days a week. (This is why  I think I have depression) \n\nMy whole life I've always been quiet and shy and I am 23. Along with this I constantly am worried and anxious when I go to work and off since I work in the hospital and go to college too. Feels like I have no free time. But I also tend to not want to be around people and interact with people so I usually stay quiet until I get asked a question or need to ask one. When I do get the courage or if I feel like interacting with people and try to meet people or make friends I always talk quietly. Sometimes I just quickly stop the conversation and leave because I was getting to nervous. For relationships, I don't want to date or have sex because I'm simply not interested into dating and spending that much time with someone that close for my whole life and for the sex part I just don't want kids ever and I think sex is gross anyways. I really do like my alone time and I think I don't want to date or get married because of all the bad relationships I've seen in my life and rather not go through that. So that's why I'm pretty sure that schizoid personality disorder. But I also think I might be Aromantic abd Asexual but I don't mind not labeling myself as long people understand I don't want a relationship and sex. \n\nMy last point is that I either have substance use disorder or just dependent. It is because I have a lot of medical problems like sickle cell anemia and lots of back and hip pain and a few headaches. feel very fatigued as well from this and have very bad insomnia.  So I just use Hydrocodone a lot that I was prescribed. And when I say a lot I mean I usually use all 30 pill within 2 weeks or under. It takes 2 pills to get through the day,  4 pills a day to feel alright and 6 to get high. I never taken 7 or 8 pills in a day. Side note can't take anything like ibuprofen or advil because I'm allergic to NSAIDS so I can only take tylenol or opiates. \n\nDon't want to make this post any longer so any thoughts if I should go to therapy or not?"""

A possible clot, Superficial Thrombophleblitis, CIDP, self diagnosed CRPS have all been mentioned but I think all are ruled out at this point.  Honestly, I really need help/ideas as I am in pain every day and more and more symptoms seem to be showing up.\n\n45 male 5\'8ish"" 166 lbs caucasion, midwest state.  I have been on various drugs since I was 20 for high blood pressure.  Been taking 5 mg and 10 mg Lisinipril for over 10 years.  It has seemed to mostly keep my blood pressure at around 120 over 80.\n\nI have no known family history of Multiple Sclerosis.\n\nFully vaccinated...for everything including Covid.\n\nI ran cross country and track in high school and college.  My running continued into my late twenties...but I mostly switched to another sport (which involves a lot of running).  Before all this happened, I considered myself to be active and agile and strong.  I worked out regularly.  I have worked occasionally as a gardener for the past several years.\n\nMy diet is probably higher than normal for dairy products and I probably eat a lot of flour as I like to make sourdough bread and other baking products often.  The one thing that is high in my blood tests were my cholesterol numbers...probably because my family likes whole milk, cheese, and yogurt so much.  My doctor was not concerned about that though.\n\nI injured myself in early 2021 doing a box jump.  Missed it. Landed on my shins.  Gouged a chunk of skin out of my right shin.  Still have a scar.  On my left shin, I got a big deep bruise.  I thought I healed up fine from this injury.\n\nGot Covid on August 1st.  About three days into that I woke up from a nap.  Was about to get up when my left shin felt started having a burning searing, spasmy pain.  I realized later that this was exactly across from my scar on my right leg.  The pain is above a 7 when it starts...but usually settles down to an ache and then sometimes goes away.  Sometimes it just aches and aches.  So, went to urgent care clinic.  They took an ultrasound to rule out a blood clot/DVT.   They said they found some wall thickening.  Diagnosed me with a chronic pain condition called Superficial Thromboplebitis. Prescribed me to take Paxlovid and an over the counter NSAID. \n\nThings that set off the pain: If I got out of a cold shower into hot air or came from air conditioning into a hot car.  That would really set it off.  Also kneeling on my knee would set off the ache and if I was not careful, would probably set off the high level pain.\n\nAnyways, I took the Paxlovid and one expired Aleve and the pain ceased pretty much immediately.  I almost forgot about it.\n\nOn October 13th, I had just finished walking a half mile in the morning, when the pain/ache returned.  I was a few days into a cold.  I got another Ultrasound, showed nothing.  Still no other symptoms.  But after this appointment I noticed some tenderness down the inside of my right leg.  I also had a poison ivy-like skin reaction to the gel that they used during the Ultrasound.  As a gardener, I often get Poison Ivy, so I keep a Prednisone taper prescription on hand. I used it here. I believe it worked stopping my allergic reaction for the rash.  I do not believe the rash was related to whatever else is bothering me, however, taking Prednisone may have affected it.  Using this steroid may have been the reason why the pain settled down for awhile.\n\nThe pain mostly was manageable for awhile, but became high level again on about November 4th.  This is when I finally got to see a better doctor.  He ordered several blood tests and an EMG.  Also referred me to see a specialist for Long Term Covid and also a spine doctor.  Told me to start taking 1800 mg Ibuprofen a day.  The blood tests showed that I was normal or negative for just about everything. \n\nAfter that November 4th appointment, I had more symptoms appear. Basically I got a bunch of spots in my calves and shins and especially on the insides of my lower legs including my ankles that felt like the muscle was catching or pinching. Stretching did not help. This bothered me so much that I could barely walk. I believe the Ibuprofen dosage eventually allowed the symptoms to pass.almost completely. \n\nI also got my last Covid booster shortly after this appointment.\n\nSo, with no symptoms, that is when I got the EMG, saw the covid and spine doctors.  EMG said that my nerves were functioning appropriately.  Covid specialist said that I did not check off enough of the Covid boxes to be considered having Long Term Covid. Spine doctor indicated that my pain did not radiate down the nerves from my back, so a cause coming from my back was unlikely. He did say that I should get an MRIso I am working on that.\n\nThe Covid person told me to not take so much Ibuprofen. So, I started taking Aleve and Aleve PM instead. The Aleve PM kinda sort helps me sleep through the pain.\n\nI am also requesting a test for Lyme Disease and Hypothyroidismbecause they both can cause Peripheral Neuropathy.\n\nBasically, my one painful spot comes and goes. And I have a variety of other symptoms. Mostly I just feel various spots in my body. They just feel weird. In my right calf and shin. And especially in my left forearm. My right forearm and wrist. In my left lower back. Other symptoms are that I woke up yesterday to the tips of my fingers being numb. I was able to shake them and get feeling back. I have had a slight head ache occasionally. \n\nBecause of my one painful spot, I can only limp around. I have rarely left my house in the last three weeks. It is really hard to work out when you cant use one of your legs, so I have not worked out in quite a while.\n\nOne other symptom is that my temperature seems consistently low. 97.2 is common. Once, I measured 96.6 at the doctors office. And my feet and ankles are almost always cold to the touch of my hands. I have been wearing a ton of clothes and hat lately and being buried underneath blankets at nightway more than I used to. I know it is recently winterbut my body just does not seem to generate much heat. I used to wake up in the morning in a cocoon of heatand now it seems like there is no heat when I wake up.\n\nFeel free to ask me questions.'"
NSAID constipation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/133j7wu/cant_take_nsaids/,b'Cant take NSAIDS',,"b'Hi everyone,\n\nLong story short - Im unable to take NSAIDS due to kidney disease. And I know this is bad, but Ive been taking 2-3 Advil when its unbearable. It helps me go from being unable to walk to actually functioning almost normal. But obviously, I cant keep doing that (and only have been when I absolutely cannot take it anymore).\n\nMy doctor has me on gabapentin for nerve pain, which I do find helpful. But doesnt help the other pain in my back/hip. I have T3s and a very low dose of hydromorphone but I dont get any relief from them - I just get sleepy, constipated, and pukey . \n\nI am wondering if there are other things that have given relief to you that is not a NSAID. I do physio, massage, ice and heat (though I find heat sometimes makes it worse).\n\nAny natural methods? Other meds I can try or ask doctor for? Vitamins? Diet? Im in Canada so THC/CBD is an option for me too (I do have 2 children though so cant get any sort of high during the day). \n\nCurious whats worked for others thanks!'"

I\'ll completely forget what I\'m doing, or just make mistakes.  I also have problems with competing issues and determining their priority.  To me, everything seems like a fire, everything has equal priority - but it\'s not true.   This is a special hell because I\'m a project manager.\n\nFor medication, I\'m on a small dosage of Adderall, and I only take it when I need to be ""on"" in meetings and presentations.  Otherwise, I get by from creating elaborate task management and note-taking processes for myself - which inadvertently, along with the hyperfocus, has helped me be very successful.\n\nEnough backstory on ADHD.  I ALSO have a family history of epilepsy.  Mine is not common and seizures are RARE for me, but in November I had one, then another in January.   As a response to that, my neurologist added an additional anti-seizure medication to what I was already taking - Lamotrigine (brand name: Lamictal).  I have a bit of depression too, from languishing during lockdowns, stress, and the state of the world.\n\nI noticed in the RX description that Lamotrigine is also used as a mood stabilizer for bi-polar disorder.  I\'m thinking ""great benefit"", and immediately I seemed to BE in a better mood, like OFTEN, and told my doctor, ""Please don\'t change anything - let me stay on this forever.  I feel great.""\n\nBut another thing happened.  I ALSO started to feel incredibly organized, and incredibly articulate in conversation and work.  So much so that (also coincidentally) I\'ve made it to final rounds in a very complex interview process with insane confidence.  Something I\'ve never, ever had.  I still feel this way.  I\'ve never been more productive and happy.\n\nI keep telling my wife, ""I think this medicine has both improved my depression and cured my ADHD"" so I did some googling and found this article.\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23784736/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23784736/)\n\n""Attention decit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is frequently comorbid with mood disorders in both children and adults.

Lamotrigine, an anticonvulsant indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar depression is reported to be effective in adult ADHD comorbid with bipolar II disorder. ""\n\nthen.. ""To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that lamotrigine might be a safe and effective treatment option for adult ADHD comorbid with bipolar and recurrent depression.""\n\nSo what about it?  I\'m not telling you to DO anything, but if you\'re curious, perhaps ask your physician if Lamotrigine could be an option.'"

penicillin rash,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/s0fgjn/so_many_questions/,b'So many questions',,"b"" Hello. I've suffered from psoriasis for 17 years now. It's a struggle. It all started after a big party and woke up next day extremely hungover. Progressively felt so bad I took myself to the hospital. Ended up with mono and strep. Have no idea how. Anyhow doctor gave me penicillin  had a horrible reaction, ended up getting a full body rash, then ended up with guttate. Started with small dots, then just got worse over the years. I'd say it's moderate now, as I have patches all over. Scalp being the worst, it's such a bummer!. Anyhow doctors are a joke when it comes to this desease. They laugh at me when I say I'm 90% sure I have this because I had strep and ask if they can look into getting my tonsils removed. They just shrug and say they have never heard of a thing. So been on steroids for years. So finally got fed up made a appointment with a Derm, got denied any treatment because I was told I had latent tb. So I leave the office confused as F. Asking how the F did I ever get TB, mind running wild. Went to my doctor got tested for tb about 5 times  all negative. So I asked them if they are giving me the latent tb test? I had 3 or 4 doctors say there is no such thing! Can u believe this? I did finally find one doctor that knew what the test was in emergency, but couldn't give it to me because it could get him suspended? Can you imagine? So I'm just like F this. Wtf. Then the pandemic happens. So now I think I have tb, I'm a strep carrier,  I feel like I have mono everytime I get a cold. Now I got to worry about covid, and I'm covered in psoriasis. \n  I just can't believe how uneducated some doctors are to psoriasis. I find it amazing that probably most of us know more about it then actual doctors. I've been put through the ringer....and I don't even know what to do anymore. I have a very busy job, 2 kids, a wife, and it's just work, family and sleep. Not alot of time to be running around trying to find answers from uneducated doctors.\n\n At my wits end. I won't give up on this, but wow....is it this hard for everyone else to get answers?  I bet it's even harder with covid around to get the help I need.\n\n Don't even know where to start anymore. Because I feel like the same thing is going to happen. I feel no confidence in doctors at this point.\n\n Still just as confused as the first time I went to the Derm..."""

It's also quite painful especially when wet or just after drying (after shower, etc.). Sometimes I cannot bend my knuckles and just touching the skin is verry painful. \n2. The tiny blisters.

Advil swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/12qa92p/one_year_post_op_update/,b'One Year Post OP - update',,"b""When I was in the depths of pain, I always appreciated hearing from people doing well, so thought I'd come back and share an update.\n\nMy history - Pain (left-sided glute, hip, thigh) started in July 2021. Suffered, and worked out harder for about 6 weeks before seeing a doctor who Rx PT and nothing else. Failed PT (they told me to stop coming) and finally got imaging in Sept 2021 which showed L4/L5 disc problem causing pain. Did 2 steroid shots in October and November 2021, tried a chiropractor and more PT. Was miserable.\n\nJanuary 2022, saw a surgeon who recommended MD with laminectomy. I waited a few weeks so surgery would happen at end of my teaching term. The first surgery was on March 1, 2021, I felt a little better immediately after, but as soon as the steroid pack wore off, the pain was back and got WORSE. I was crying in agony and despair 2 - 4 weeks post-op. I called the surgeon's PA and did another MRI. when I went back for 6-week post-op, the surgeon said that a ligament had fallen into the space he created and he recommended another surgery ASAP. So 6 weeks after the first, on April 21, 2022, I had 2nd MD/laminectomy. Recovery went much better - until 6 weeks post-op when I suddenly had swelling at my incision site. The surgery team almost sent me stat to the OR but because of end-of-year craziness, I asked to watch and wait, and it did resolve but caused a MAJOR setback. Imaging showed swelling that started at the surgery site in the spine all the way to within a few millimeters of breaking through - so it ripped all the internal healing and I was back at square 1. It was miserable. In July and August I healed, worked through more pain, and started PT in September 2022. Things got progressively better but I did have a few setbacks - including right after I healed from COVID in December 2022 - I thought I was for sure back to the beginning, I was out of commission for a few days, but over the course of about 6 weeks, the pain got better. \n\nLingering pain led me to a new Physiatrist who is more holistic and led me to a pilates-based PT. I now do Pilates and walk almost every day. I've accepted I will likely always be 'high maintenance' and never back to some of my favorite activities (like mountain biking and white water rafting). I have a few more discs that are unstable, but I'm not in pain most days. Days I don't need any Advil feel like such a win and I've made it a week or more without needing pain relief - which is amazing. \n\nKeep trying new things when something doesn't work for you and keep the faith- it will get better."""
Advil eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/297vjw/how_to_survive_claravis_isotretinoin_accutane/,"b'[HOW TO] Survive Claravis (Isotretinoin, Accutane)'",,"b'Before I decided to embark on this adventure (yes, it is) I looked across reddit to find information regarding personal experience/ advice/ dos and don\'ts while taking Claravis.  I\'m going to do my best to summarize my experience so far.  I hope that this helps you in making a very important decision.\n\nThe first thing that you **HAVE** to understand is that this is a **FULL TIME COMMITMENT.**  No picking, no alcohol, and hydrate, in that order.  For the last 4+ months I have had to travel everywhere I go with two different tubs of lotion, chapsticks, and a scripted reasoning for why I had to carry around all of this stuff.\n\n***PRODUCTS:*** Tub of Aqaufor for lips, and severely dry skin.  Tub of Cetaphil for dry skin.  I use the body lotion on my face, it was the only thing strong enough to get me through most of the day.  I have chapsticks at my desk at work, two in my car, and at least one in my pocket.  **The first month is crucial: you have to experiment and figure out which brands work for you best.**  I use the girly egg thing from CVS, does wonders.\n\n***WATER:*** You have to hydrate.  If you do not, you will feel groggy and dry.  Not just your skin, but your insides.  Your lungs will feel dry, your blood will feel dry.  Before taking Claravis I drank more water then anyone that I knew.  I\'ve literally doubled my intake, you notice a difference.\n\n***PICKING:*** Claravis gets rid of old skin fast.  If you have a pimple coming in, **LEAVE IT!**  Your skin is so fragile, that when you pick at it, or even pop it, it leaves an enormous crater where the pimple once was and takes days to heal.  The claravis will get rid of the pimple on its own.  If it does not, wait until it is a nice whitehead, take a hot compress and get it soft.  Scrape the whitehead off and push from the inside of your cheek with your tongue to get whatever you can out.  The medicine will handle the rest.\n\n***MOUTH:*** Before bed, I usually shower, put on a fresh coat of lotion, and lather my lips in aquafor.  **ESPECIALLY THE CORNERS OF YOUR MOUTH.**  The most annoying thing by far was in the second month when I didn\'t pay attention to the corners and started playing basketball, sweating, and licking my lips a lot and drying them out.  They crack, turn red, and are impossible to heal.  Almost every hour for the last 2 months I put a fresh coat of aqua on the corner just to keep them wet.  I sleep with an inch of aqua on the corners.  **DONT LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU!**\n\n***NOSE:*** Your nose will be beyond dry.  I have some of the worst allergies my allergist has ever seen.  Years ago, I had sinus surgery to make my breathing bearable.  The dryness will help people with allergies, but using tissues will cause your nose to bleed.  Don\'t expect too many nosebleeds.  I\'ve only had one in four months and it was when I got out of bed.  When I go to sleep, I like to get some aqua up there and keep everything moist.\n\n**EYES:**  Your eyes will get dry.  You will wake up with an enormous amount of ""sleep"" in them and it will be hard to even open them some mornings.  Get a tissue and wipe it out.  If this is really bad you could be getting an ulcer but in my experience, just wipe it out and you will be okay.  Don\'t rub them.  Eyedrops help.\n\n***STOMACH:*** I experienced bad stomach pain early.  I cut out a lot of bad foods, and realized that maybe it was just my diet...I have lost my appetite.  Therefore, I try to make my food intake count and eat healthier things instead of snacks.  Because I lost my 3 meal schedule, I was trying to make up for it by snacking, therefore causing the stomach pain.  Be aware that your appetite can change.\n\n**FATIGUE:** Push yourself to be active.  It will make you want to sit at home and watch movies.  That is all and well, assuming that you have had a productive day.  Get out of the house and get outdoors.  Exercise was difficult to maintain at first.  I used to go to the gym 5 days a week.  Once I started Claravis, I go 7 days and sometimes as early as 6am.  Push yourself and beat the potential side effects.  **They will only effect you if you let them.**  More on this later.\n\n**DRINKING:** You take monthly blood tests to monitor your liver.  I have chosen to not drink while on Claravis.  Some people do.  It\'s your journey.  It can be very dangerous to do so.  More on this later as well.\n\n**DEPRESSION:** I can see how this drug can make you depressed.  I have felt myself becoming more emotional then before taking Claravis.  However, if you are taking it, you hate your skin.  **HOW CAN YOU BE UPSET WHEN YOUR SKIN IS FINALLY CLEAR??!**  If you really do have trouble, don\'t hide it.  I told everyone at work, all of my friends, and generally anyone that asks why I have so much lotion and chapstick with me that I am taking Claravis and have told my coworkers and friends that if they notice any changes, to tell me.  Mood swings happen, and there are days where you just wake up on the wrong side of the bed.  The best thing to do is just get through the day and know that tomorrow will be better.  I haven\'t had two bad days in a row yet.\n\nUnderstand that taking Isotrentinoin is an adventure.  It isn\'t advil, or something that you just have to remember to take and that is it.  It takes over your life.  It is a commitment that you have to work through.  The first month or two is difficult because you are putting all of this work in and not seeing many results.  Eventually your skin clears.  And when it does, you can sit back, relax, and do your routines that you have perfected over the month or so time you have been waiting and experimenting with.  \n\nFigure out what works best for you.  Try something new every day in the first weeks: where you put lotion, where does it help, where does it not get dry.  Everyone is different and the best advice that I can give you is to work hard on making it an easier ride.  There are days where I wont put any lotion on at all and see where I am drying out the most.  \n\nI will offer you a tip that I picked up just to let you know how crazy you are going to get with your routines.  After I shower, I dry my body, then take two separate hand towels.  The first, is to pat my face dry.  I then take a second hand towel and delicately scrape off all of the dead dry skin that I can find.  Why wait for it to peel off when it is just sitting there waiting to peel.  Don\'t push hard, but work some extra stuff off.  \n\nAfter over four months, I have nearly perfect skin.  There is an occasional breakout but by the next day, the medicine takes control and gets rid of it.  It really is amazing to monitor to and watch happen.  Sometimes you will have a large zit brewing, and hours later it is totally gone.  I do not suggest doing this in the winter, as the cold weather will eat at your skin.  And men, shaving is a pain.  \n\n**Use this as an opportunity to better yourself, not just your skin.**  If you aren\'t drinking for 6 months, exercise everyday, eat healthier, and make better decisions.  Be open about your medicine, and talk to people about it.  The worst thing that you can do it keep it a secret.  I think that that leads to depression.\n\nTaking my pill every morning and night doesnt even feel like it is for my skin.  I almost feel like it a reminder to be a better person, and to treat my body better.  The skin clearing up has become a secondary perk.  Six months is a LONG time.  I\'m not even done with what I signed up for but I couldn\'t be happier with my decision.\n\nAny and all questions are welcome.  None to big, and none to small.  Happy to help.  Expect updates as I continue my adventure.\n\nEDIT: Officially done with my 5 month dose. It\'s been three full days, and I am still dry, if not more than before...could be explained by the weather or an outside factor.  So far so good!'"
Advil itch,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/2ckv8p/wife_has_multiple_personalitiespersonas/,b'Wife has multiple personalities/personas?',,"b'My wife has recently revealed to me that she has two personas that she \'slips into\' when she is nervous. One is a tough Scandinavian(Maybe Icelandic? She seems kind of nordic to me, especially her name, but I\'m not sure of ""her"" ""county of origin"") woman, who wears a lot of dark and revealing clothing, and she\'s very confidant and sexually appealing. (Her words, not mine, I think my wife is always beautiful) and the other is softer woman, she is outgoing, wears bright colors and dresses, and jokingly calls herself a fairy queen, because she loves flowers or floral prints. She will go so far to wear wigs and makeup to further change her appearance. (Not completely odd, but she usually doesn\'t even wear makeup)\n\nI don\'t know if I should be worried. She doesn\'t want to talk to a therapist about it, because she is happy and it seems to help her, and I don\'t know if there is a negative effect to this.\n\nThough it worried me today when my wife told me she wanted people to refer to her as her persona\'s name when she is in that persona. These two persona\'s represent two big personality traits she **thinks** she is not, confidant and attractive.\n\nShe\'s also rarely referred to a third persona that used to ""take over for her"" when she was younger and afraid, but I\'ve never personally seen this persona, or heard her mentioned in quite some time.\n\nShe\'s has been diagnosed with PTSD because of her traumatic childhood, and I\'ve been suspecting for about 6 months that she might also be bipolar. I\'ve been reading as much as I can about it, and I\'m **not** self diagnosing, but it sound EXACTLY like her, and that worries me. She was taking a LOT of meds before she refused to see her therapist anymore and quit them all cold turkey and she hated it to the point that I have to fight her just to get her to take Advil for a headache. Her therapist didn\'t really care about her and would constantly and repeatedly tell her to do things that never worked for her, or she wouldn\'t tell her how to do them. (EX. Telling her multiple times to tap her hands when she is nervous, didn\'t work. Told her to buy anti itch cream for her She has anger problems, she bottles it up til she explodes, therapist told her to find a healthy outlet or way to express it. She asked for help on how because she honestly doesn\'t know, and she just kept saying ""Try something that works for you."" and then promptly ended the session 20 minutes early. It\'s only the first therapist we\'ve tried, but it\'s kind of put her off the idea of therapists.) Her therapist also dismissed her self harm merely because it wasn\'t cutting. My wife hits herself very hard when she does something ""wrong"" or when she is frustrated, and she\'s left bruises on her hands and arms when she bites herself for the same reason. She also obsessively scratches and picks at things. I\'ve managed to keep her from scarring her face, her chest and arms, but her shins/ankles look awful.\n\nHer life flip flopped when she moved away from her father\'s house. She didn\'t even know anything was wrong with her until she left, because even though her father is an awesome guy, he isn\'t a doctors kind of person and has a lot of stereotypical misconceptions about mental health which make my wife afraid to talk to him about her problems.. She has chronic anemia (to the point that she would be so tired she would stop where she was and lay on the floor and fall asleep. Not like narcolepsy where she would just pass out, but she would get too tired to move, purposefully lay on the floor and then sleep) and was often told she just needed a nap. Luckily her dad is a meat and potatoes kind of guy, so she was getting constant iron. But I can\'t afford that, so her only choice is iron pills, which make her sick. And most of her bad memories were repressed or she consciously ignored them and didn\'t even realize they were that bad.\n\nIt\'s frustrating as hell because I want so bad to help her. to see her run home and hug me excitedly when I come home from work like she used to when we first moved out together. But now she\'s so lonely and anxious sometimes she doesn\'t even get out of bed and just cries all day. Where we live, riding the bus isn\'t exactly convenient, and she gets extremely anxious even when in a car, so driving herself isn\'t an option now. She refuses to have roommates, because the last couple were awful. She spends the entire week home alone and she lives for the weekends, when we can leave the house together. She is terrified of leaving alone, because when she has an anxiety/panic attack, she completely shuts down, or just runs away. It\'s like fight or flight, but more like shut down or flight. \n\nShe had an anxiety attack when she was walking home in the dark about two years ago when she missed her bus home and she shut down so badly I had to leave work immediately and hunt her down in the city. Nothing happened to her, to which I am immensely relieved, but now she\'s terrified of it happening again, so she just *doesn\'t* leave the house alone, unless it\'s to check the mail.\n\nI\'m trying to get us out of the apartment we\'re in at the end of our lease, which is soon, but she\'s being stressful about that too.\n\nI\'m sorry, this turned into a kind of rant, but I guess I needed to let it out. If someone has some advice for me, please **PLEASE** message me or reply. I\'m so desperate to see my wife smile again that I would do anything. '"
corticosteroid problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/e02yql/bad_longterm_cystsacne/,b'Bad long-term cysts/acne',,"b'I\'m hoping to get some answers here, as I\'ve tried OTC acne treatments, numerous antibiotics, anti-fungal creams, corticosteroid creams, and numerous other medications.  \n6-7 months ago I began developing bad breakouts on my back, face, chest, and arms. In fact I actually developed a cyst on my gum but it was short term and hasn\'t come back.  \nThis problem persisted and continued to get worse, I began getting huge cysts on and behind my ears, then my jaw, neck, chest, penis and back. I developed a huge one in the crack of where the lord split me.(butt) It was painful but popped and went away, since then hasn\'t occurred again. However they are reoccurring on my face,ears,back,chest, and neck. They are painful and when popped will ooze a clear liquid and feel as if air is coming out or almost like deflating, if that makes sense.  \nThere is no smell to the clear oozing liquid. They get significantly large in size, become red and inflamed, and significantly painful. They last anywhere from a week to 3 weeks sometimes longer before disappearing but as soon as one disappears, another one or two take its place. They seem to reoccur where old ones had been, this isn\'t the case always.  \nGenerally they scab up making me look like I am using meth, it\'s so bad I have given up dating since they began and it has steadily grown worse. So much that some-days I don\'t want to leave the house to go to work or the store. I don\'t like looking in the mirror and especially hate taking pictures because these annoying cysts have lowered my self esteem so much.  \n\n\nI\'ve had blood work ran numerous times, no STD\'s, and all the results ""appeared to be normal."" 5 years ago I was hospitalized for MRSA infection and still have a huge scar from where they had to cut my shoulder open to drain, flush, and pack the wound. I was in there for 7 days.  \n\n\nHere\'s what I take.  \nI was in Pain Management for years because of several disc issues in my back. L4/L5 the worst and C-spine. After my daughter was born I began using kratom and left pain management.  \nI have taken Kratom without breaks for almost two years which as you can imagine has increased my tolerance exponentially... I can take an OZ a day generally a little less but sometimes more. I don\'t measure my doses I just load a big old country tablespoon up and toss/wash. It has helped my pain, my IBS-D, my PTSD, ADHD, and anxiety.  \n\n\nI\'m on two prescriptions right now, which I have been on almost my whole life. One being relatively new at a year but I rarely take it.  \n(1) *Adderall* (**DextroAmphetamine**) **30MG IR 2x daily** (During the work week I take it 2 times daily but on weekends I take anywhere from 1 to 1.5. I\'ve been on this since I was 6 or 7 years old and been on it continuously.   \n(2) *Librium*  (**Chlordiazepoxide)** **25MG 3x daily** (This is the one I rarely take.. I actually probably have about 200 pills from left overs if not more.)  \n\n\nOTC medication/supplements  \n(1) Ibuprofen, motrin, advil etc. (Not everyday but atleast 2x a week.)  \n(2)Tylenol or BC-Powders (Atleast 1 to 2 times a week, I try to avoid these.)  \n(3) Level-Up- Mushrooms LVL:Max (Just started these this week. 3 capsules at night. Chaga,Lions mane, and Cordycep mushrooms)  \n(4)Kratom (Daily usage, heavy doses-At least 2-3 tablespoons at a time. 4-6x daily)-My family thinks its from kratom.  \n(5) Energy drinks such as Reign and Bang which contain BCAA,Creatine, taurine, caffeine, CoQ10. I\'ve stopped consuming this but on general I was drinking 2-3 daily. It\'s been at least 3 days since I have switched to coffee and the cysts appear to be getting better and skin is clearing up. However it\'s done this before right before it hits me hard. \n\nI also vape but do not use drugs or drink.

I am currently seeing a Neurologist who is running more tests, but I would appreciate any insight as I am desperate. The neurologist hasn\'t communicated a suspected diagnosis as of yet. The headache is significant and impacts my daily life, I have only been able to work part time since (at most 2 days a week). Some photophobia, pain is a constant, stabbing, ache, typically in the forehead/temple/behind eyes area, alternates from side to side depending on the day.

Right nephrectomy 3.0 years ago due to an aquired UPJ stricture - Resulting in my obesity, difficulty recovery.\n   1. Creatinin \\~115, GFR \\~70 - Advised not to take NSAIDS by my nephrologist\n2. History of frequent nephrolithiasis, suffice to say I know a 10 on the pain scale\n3. ""atypical"" asthma (some pulmonary function tests have been normal, others have been slightly abnormal),\n4. idiopathic hypertension since 15 years old, controlled with meds\n5. Hx vestibular neuritis, late 2019\n6. Appendectomy August 2020, roughly 3 weeks prior to headache onset\n7. L4,L5 Spondylosis\n8. L4-L5 Spondylolisthesis\n\nJust over 6 months ago, I woke up with a 6/10 headache and significant ""blurry-ness"" in my left eye. As an optometrist was the easiest and quickest option, that\'s where I went first. The optometrist imaged my retina, performed some in-office tests, and recommended I see my doctor (although everything seemed normal to her).\n\nDue to COVID, I had a phone appointment with my doctor who referred me to an ophthalmologist. It is worth noting, my headache had not (and still has not) subsided.\n\nThe ophthalmologist did a series of tests, and determined that I just ""woke up and realized I needed glasses,"" as everything was normal (minus a red-cap test where colours were less vivid in my left eye) and he assumed my issues were refractory.\n\nAs the headache had not resolved, my family doctor sent me for a head MRI without contrast, which was normal, minus some maxillary sinusitis, which was treated with an antibiotic.\n\nA subsequent head CT a month later was also normal.\n\nApproximately 6 weeks after onset, my vision returned to normal (or at least near normal), and on a follow-up appointment my ophthalmologist was surprised and elated that the vision in my left eye had improved at least 90%. With testing, it is still weaker than my right, but that may have been the case before.\n\nTried 3 different ""migraine"" medications (Rizatriptan RPD, Metoclopramide, Topiramate) with no effect, and a severe reaction to the Maxalt.\n\nAt the direction of my family doc, went to the ER for ""migraine protocol"" - IV dexamethazone, metoclopramide, tordol. -- Headache completely resolved for the first time since onset, however returned that evening (about 8 hours later).\n\nIncidentally, developed a stubborn non-productive cough, my family physician treated with 10 days of prednisone (50mg/day) - By the 10th day my quality of life and pain had improved by at least 80%. That and the IV in the ER have been the only thing that gave me relief.\n\nRecently (past couple of weeks) I have noticed some diminished eyesight in my left eye once more. I have a followup with the ophthalmologist next week so he can check it objectively then.\n\nLast week I had a cervical and thoracic MRI (without contrast out of renal concern), which the initial report says is normal, aside from some ""mild degeneration"" to the thoracic discs. I do have access to the images, so I am attaching some that look concerning to me, however I am no radiologist to say the least. I have a followup with my neurologist in 7 weeks so I have not spoken to him about these scans yet.\n\nSide note: ENT had let me know that the vision/headache isn\'t and never was a result of the history of sinusitis.\n\nAbnormal bloodwork:\n\nC Rreactive Protein: HI 6.2 mg/LCH50-Hemolytic Complement: HI >60 kU/LRBC: LO 4.14  x E12/LMCH: HI 33.8 pgPhosphate: LO 0.67 mmol/LUrate: HI 590 umol/L\n\nOf note: Thyroid, ESR, and Nuclear Antibody tests were normal/negative.\n\nPossibly relevant symptoms:\n\n1. Difficulty swallowing, present for at least 2 years (hard foods get stuck in throat, must have a drink when eating anything)\n2. My eyes water a lot\n3. For the past 6-9 months I have had an intermittant red, flaking rash on my face, around my nose, mouth and chin. I had a doctor tell me it ""looks like eczema""\n4. I have been very irritable since the onset of the headache, not sure if it is due to the pain or lack of restful sleep?\n5. I have what I would call more than average amounts of joint/back pain (hands, knees, feet, neck/back), especially in the last year.\n6.

EXCEPT that when i have the rash, my taste buds on the back of my tongue are swollen because im unable to use my tongue scraper without pain and discomfort. when the rash first starts, they almost feel like theyre oozing. when they start to heal, they seem dry, almost like eczema or something, and in order to get the dead layer of skin off, i have to exfoliate or in extreme cases, literally use tape to peel the dead skin off. when its particularly bad (like now) my lips also swell. \n\ni really hope someone is able to help. it makes it very uncomfortable to talk, eat, move my mouth, kiss my wife, do anything at all. its also unsightly and embarrassing and inconvenient. i just wish i understood what it was. i have tried allegra, benadryl, aloe, eczema creams, cold sore creams, and probably other stuff too over the years. nothing has worked. i have not been able to have a dermatologist look at it because it goes away faster than they can fit me in. \n\nthank you for reading, please please comment with any ideas suggestions or thoughts. im at a loss. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/cP1None'"

corticosteroid problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7ryeeg/long_read_not_sure_whats_going_on_with_me_right/,"b""[Long Read] Not sure what's going on with me right now, has ANYONE had a similar experience and dealt with it?""",,"b""Hello and thank you for reading this in advance and sharing your opinion also I apologize as Im not very articulate. Also I realize after writing this that it kind of sounds like Im asking for a diagnosis but I promise Im not, Im more just venting and asking for peoples opinions who may have gone through similar situations.\n\nFirst a little background on me, I am a 27 year old male, Ive never had any trouble with my mental health up to this point, even after going through some very traumatic family scenes, and have dealt with my stress very well in my opinion. I am a sufferer of Crohns disease, have been diagnosed with it since I was in the 3rd grade but even that has never bothered me mentally. I was working out consistently, making good progress in strength and my physique and was feeling pretty confident in myself, I was studying for my new job willingly, I actually enjoyed studying it every day. But all of a sudden things fell apart on me.\n\nIt seemed to just hit me out of absolutely nowhere 2 weeks ago and has been going on ever since, the night it started I was going to bed and my nose was clogged and my ear felt like there was fluid buildup and I couldnt breathe very well and for some reason I got extremely agitated and worked myself into a panic because I couldnt go to sleep as a result of it. This happened once before too a few months ago, but at that time I was very sick with a terrible sinus infection but once my nose cleared then I was able to go to sleep perfectly fine. But this time the mental effect has seemed to stick around because I think I've associated nose congestion and fluid in ear feeling with not being able to sleep. Even though this time I was not really sick (maybe just a small cold), and can actually breathe good again now, I still cannot for the life of me fall asleep and worry to death all day about not being able to sleep and I feel like my diaphragm area is very tight and not taking in as much air as it should even though the doctor said my O2 saturation was good and my breathing rate was also good. So Im pretty sure that my sleep is the main problem because ever since that happened 2 weeks ago it has been like a domino effect on my mental state. Im not really depressed as far as I know but I'm not sure because I don't THINK I've ever been truly depressed, I've been very, very upset and angry but nothing like this, my emotions are practically gone, I cant laugh, I dont feel sad or hopeless although the hope is going away after these 2 weeks, I just feel nothing, nothing other than the fact that I can't sleep irritates me, and I know Im very bothered by it because I catch myself pacing through my house often, though this has calmed down a little the past few days. My sex drive just randomly disappeared along with this (was very healthy sexually before this, literally the day before) and my cravings for food also vanished, I was also eating perfectly normal before this too. No food I see or smell wets my appetite or makes me hungry, so I bought a weight gainer powder just to keep my calories up and I dont starve.\n\nMy ability to yawn is gone too which is really strange, I can feel them coming on but my body will not let them come out or fully complete. Which also bothers me because Ive associated sleep with yawning. And Im sure this is because I notice it happening and my mind stops it. \n\nBut one of the strangest things in my opinion is I have had 3 or 4 moments which lasted a few hours over the past 2 weeks where it seemed like the entire problem went away randomly and was suddenly able to crave food and eat normally, laugh, relax, focus on tv shows and feel healthy sexually again, and even felt the need to take a natural nap, but once the day winded down and I started worrying about sleep again the emptiness comes back and erases the entire good feeling.\n\nIt's to the point where I lay in my bed and either I keep repeating a thought (song lyrics or some kind of sound bit from a tv show) over and over again in my head or I would feel like I wasnt actually in my bed and I was detached from my body or I wasnt me, almost as if I was dreaming without actually being asleep. There was also a moment where my mind wouldnt actually think of anything at all and it seemed like I was just staring at a black wall of no thoughts, this I kind of think was a result of the sleep deprivation. And when I finally fall asleep I will only sleep maybe 30 minutes to an hour, then Im back up again pacing back and forth worrying about sleep. The best way I can explain the way it feels when Im able to sleep is my subconscious will play a bunch of random images or thoughts and I can feel them right in front of my eyes, but now the thoughts are very few and feel like theyre coming from the top of my head (I realize this makes me sound worse lol), and my ears seem to be very active like I'm actually focusing on everything I hear while I'm trying to sleep. I normally have very vivid lucid dreams which I absolutely love to have, even nightmares, and wake up feeling so relaxed and refreshed the next day, but now they have also stopped. It feels like the more I actually think about the problem and trying to fix it is what makes it so much worse.\n\nMy physical ability hasnt been affected really by this, I can actually play video games and puzzle/word games better than I have ever been able to since this happened (extreme focus?) and I can still drive my car at essentially the same level as I could before granted I'm not running 36+ hours straight of being awake. Im still able to talk to people easily, actually a little bit more open since this happened though not as happy and jokey as I usually am.\n\nI do notice that my touch sensitivity has decreased, I can still feel things but nothing is really sharp feeling, I had my friend slap my back open handed just to test and I noticed that it didnt sting I just felt pressure of the slap and nothing else. But I'm hoping this is just another symptom of sleep deprivation.\n\nI feel like I also need to mention that I was on corticosteroids for months before this for my crohns and feel it could potentially be an adrenal gland issue? (Unlikely, but just throwing that out there)\n\nI went to the doctor for this and was prescribed ambien which has been helping me get progressively more sleep each night I take it except for last night it didn't do anything at all. because I felt like I was able to eat and chose to do that which I think ruined it since it was supposed to be taken on an empty stomach, but even when it does work I dont really like it because it doesnt feel like a natural sleep and Im also afraid of developing a habit.\n\nHas anyone ever been through something like this? Am I just  doing this to myself, worrying myself to death for absolutely no reason? If so, how do you go about this? Does it seem like something that would go away with some meditation or do you think I should pursue some more medical attention?\n\nPS. I would just like to say as someone who has never really had any instances like this, I could never quite understand how people who were going through these things truly felt. Now I know and have so much more empathy and sympathy for people so that's a positive thing that has come from it. And also it has made me personally realize that I would much rather feel emotional pain than be numb because I feel as if my soul is just ripped out of me, and I hate it so much.

NSAID problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/u2avlt/i_fucked_up_so_bad_that_i_could_have_killed/,b'I fucked up so bad that I could have killed myself by accident.',,"b""This will forever go down in history as the worst thing I've ever forgotten. \n\n\n  Long story short, my brain deleted the information that you should never combine SSRIs with alcohol or ibuprofen. I may very well have been reminded of this at points, but those also got deleted. Probably because I've been sick as fuck. \n\n\n  Recently I started back on Lexapro at 5mg which really rounded out the 40mg of Vyvanse I'd been on. They were working wonderfully together, no side effects. \n\n\n  Previously, I'd never held down a job for more than a year nor completed my high school education, pre-diagnosis. \n\n\n Things were on the up and up, I was developing routines again and actually felt like I had a brain for once, and then my doctor caught my platelets falling into thrombocytopenia during a routine blood check. \n\n\n  I didn't think I had any symptoms at the time save for a bit of extra bruising lately, but I have hEDS so what else is new.\n\n\n  Then I started to get *sick*. It felt like a flareup of the worst of my chronic illnesses. Night sweats, tachycardia, bloating and gas, joint and muscle pain, fever, fatigue- there's not enough room to list them all.\n\n\n  I stumbled upon a reddit thread that mentioned the dangers of combining antidepressants and NSAIDs (like ibuprofen), I looked up what else you shouldn't take with them, and now I'm sitting here feeling like a dumbarse.\n\n\n  So here's the worst bit. I'm annoyed with myself now, because I was medicated and didn't bother to read the leaflet in the Lexapro box, but do you know why I didn't?\n\n\n  Because I'd taken it before, years ago when I was 17. I'd been prescribed it for severe anxiety during late high school. I didn't have to worry about the alcohol warnings because I couldn't drink. \n\n\n  I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until I was 28 years old, and certainly not medicated before then. I had next to no chance of remembering this.\n\n\n  Of course I also forgot about the warnings about NSAIDs in the leaflet when I was 17, so good chance I took them at some point. \n\n\n  At 18 (legal in Australia) I also began to drink socially, but particularly frequently when I got a long term partner for the first time who had been drinking for a few years already. \n\n\n  From the age of 18, I had begun to suffer from gastrointestinal issues which progressed to chronic fatigue syndrome, malabsorption, chronic pain and made my mild food intolerances go from 0-100. \n\n\n  At one point, I was put on baby food by a dietician because I was so limited with what I could consume without symptoms that she was concerned about malnourishment. \n\n\n  Of course, after my symptoms had progressed to that point, it was very clear that I couldn't tolerate much of anything, let alone ibuprofen or alcohol, but neither I nor anyone else made the connection. I saw dozens of practitioners. I don't know how we all missed it. I'd been taking Lexapro for 6 years. \n\n\n  I was so ill that it eventually lead to divorce with aforementioned partner, after only 3 years of marriage. I couldn't work, I couldn't study, I could barely do housework. It would take me 2 hours just to do the dishes and I'd collapse not long afterwards.\n\n\n  The fact that he didn't believe I was really sick was its own problem, so I clearly had other issues on my hands, but I'll never stop wondering if things would have been different if I'd never been sick. If we could have grown together through our issues. We were both under immense stress. \n\n\n  It has literally taken me _ten years_ of doctors and thousands of dollars in medical fees (I'm still in debt to this day) to heal from the damage done. \n\n\n  Now, granted I also have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome so I am particularly sensitive to the havoc the alcohol and ibuprofen wreaked on my body, but acknowledging that doesn't give me back my lost years.\n\n\n  I lost _everything._ I lived in my parent's shed for 4 months at one point because I had nowhere else to go after the divorce, no money and unable to work. A literal tin shed, in summer, in Australia. \n\n\n  Their 'house' was about the size of a trailer, they couldn't put me up anywhere else (they didn't even have a lounge room), and my cat obviously couldn't be kept in the shed all day so she had to be allowed outside. She was killed by a neighbouring dog 3 months in, not long before we were able to move. \n\n\n  Life is so wonderful now, but I feel broken hearted all over again, thinking of how long it took me to climb out of that terrible place of illness and poverty, and I nearly did it all over again. \n\n\n  Thankfully I am on a disability pension now, so I will never be in such a place of desperation again, but I could easily have put myself back to square one with my health. \n\n\n  This month when I started getting symptoms again, all it took was a single sip of beer. I got a nasty headache. I took a couple of ibuprofen. I got sicker, the headaches got worse. The beginning of another end. \n\n\n  I've worked so hard to accept my conditions, and I do love myself and respect that ADHD has always been a part of me whether I knew it or not. It's not my fault and you can only know things when you know them.\n\n\n But, for now, I have to say it one last time before I gather myself again. \n\n\n  **FUCK YOU, ADHD**"""

I was prescribed Symbacort and a rescuer inhaler and sent home. \n\nSecond visit he agreed with her diagnosis however gave me a codeine cough syrup to help me sleep which helps to make me sleepy but does not actually help me sleep. He also sent me for a chest X-ray. \n\nThird visit I find out my X-ray was perfectly clear and that my lungs are just fine. After discussing my symptoms he decides that it sounds like post nasal drip and prescribes me nasonex. He also tells me I dont need the puffers. \n\nNow between all of these visits I have cleaned my apartment thoroughly, I have tried taking allergy meds, Ive tried taking cough syrup (both OTC and the prescription) and the cough just wont go away. \n\nThe cough has changed a bit, I feel like I dont loose the ability to breathe quite as often as I did, and I havent coughed up blood in about a week now. \n\nIm loosing my mind here. Nothing they prescribe seems to help and Im so tired of coughing all the time. All I want is to be able to get a decent night sleep. It feels like I would have been better off to keep smoking since all of these problems started after I quit. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.'"

This discomfort has led to multiple coping strategies that have created **muscular ache around the temporomandibular joint** **(particularly on the left).** I was referred to an **endodontist that prescribed Cracked Tooth Syndrome** as a potential prognosis, but there was no crack visible on the tooth, and they stated that the issue could be multifaceted. I am **awaiting an orofacial pain specialist opinion.** A week ago, I **had a root canal,** and this has **not resolved the problem.** \n\nI have spent hours researching my issue for months, but have found nothing that accounts for my situation. There have been no signs of decay (which all root canal articles point to), and there is no case for dentin hypersensitivity now that the nerve is gone. I am at a loss, and I hoping that someone has seen something like this.\n\n>**TIMELINE:** Back in February this year, I  had a routine fissure sealant appointment to cover up exposed dentin. Despite telling my dentist that I was highly ""occusally aware"" (term learned later) and that **there was too much sealant over the lower left first molar for my bite to be comfortable,** he dismissed it and said that I would get used to it.  \n>  \n>**The sealant was reduced two weeks later** after complaining that I was getting pain when biting downm however, it remained just a little too much (probably 1/2mm too much) over one particular spot that continued to hurt. Two weeks later, **the sealant was one again adjusted,** but the **pain remained.** Two weeks later (begin on April), that tooth got a filling at the site of the pain. However, the **filling solved nothing.** A month later (May), I was referred to an endodontist who prescribed multi-factorial Cracked Tooth Syndrome as a potential culprit, potentially due to a crack in the dentin.  \n>  \n>After trying to install an orthodontic band (in June) made the situation worse (i.e. it made my bite horrifically misaligned), it was removed in the same appointment after an observation period. Two weeks later, **the tooth was reduced and crowned with a temporary crown**. This resolved the temperature sensitivity, understandably, but **the pain on biting down still remained,** as does the passive discomfort.  \n>  \n>**I pushed for a root canal** (something I initially asked for in May) after the dentist suggested that we wait potentially a month or more for an orofacial pain opinion via the NHS, which I am still waiting for. My major concerns with waiting for another opinion came down to the fact that if this suffering could be ended with a root canal, I didn\'t want to wait 1-2 more months to do it. Unfortunately, almost a week post-procedure, the same symptoms I have experienced remained, and I am feeling at the end of my rope.\n\n**The lingering discomfort dominates my focus, and it makes doing my work incredibly difficult.** Medications like **paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen)** have been ineffective in reducing the pain or the discomfort. I have begun to **wonder to what extent it is a nerve-related issue,** but I do not know where to start, and my searches have led me nowhere. \n\nIf anyone has observed a case like mine before, perhaps you would have a key bit of information that could lead to the resolution of this life-controlling pain. Thank you for anything you can provide.'"

codeine vomit,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/11w5v97/help_multiple_doctors_havent_found_whats_wrong/,"b""Help! Multiple doctors & haven't found what's wrong""",,"b'29 year old female - below is a very detailed overview of my health. I am looking for anybody who can potentially lead me in which direction I should turn to next.\n\nShort Version: I\'ve had the same chronic pain in my left upper abdominal quadrant for 3 years, since March 2020. The pain is primarily located anteriorly just underneath the rib cage in the mid-clavicular line. The pain seems to be gradual throughout the day, with it being pretty severe at night, depending on what I am doing or how I am sitting. The pain will occasionally radiate to the back, up towards the sternum, and down towards the pubis and the groin on the left side. The pain is mostly positional, meaning I can relieve it by standing up, walking around, or lying down because it is most severe when I am sitting, whether that be driving, on the couch, at a table, etc. There is nothing that takes my pain away other than adjusting positions, but mostly laying down. No pain medications relieve my pain. (a detailed list of things I\'ve tried for pain will be at the bottom) I have had multiple imaging studies including a CTA of the abdomen/pelvis that showed possible Nutcracker syndrome with a 17 degree angle between the aorta and SMA with dilation of the left renal vein. I was evaluated by UW Madison for consideration of an autotransplant of my left kidney. However, after I underwent a venogram which showed equal pressures between the renal vein and IVC, Dr. Foley did not want to offer the surgery.  \nI also have had irregular menstrual cycles since I began having periods. Within the last few years, I feel like I almost get the ""period flu"" or have more PMDD symptoms before I\'m about to get it.\n\nLong Version: This all started in March 2020, my office had just moved to working from home with the Coronavirus outbreak. I hadn\'t gotten a desk/office chair for home yet, so I started out by sitting on my couch with my laptop in my lap for a couple of weeks. After about 3 weeks in I started to notice a bad pain in my left side. It was like a pinching/burning pain and it seemed to come on slowly the more I sat in the same position. My immediate thought was that it was like a ""side stitch"" or a cramp from the way I was kind of slouching and not sitting upright in a chair. I quickly made sure to get a desk and chair to see if it helped resolve the pain. Unfortunately, it did not. The more the days went on, the worse the pain was getting and it only seemed to be when I was sitting for longer periods of time. I had to start getting up more frequently and walking around or switching positions. I went to a chiropractor which did not alter the pain in any sort of way. The same chiropractor also tried a few laser therapy sessions over the affected area as well, with no relief.  \nThe pain was gradually becoming a permanent thing, and it became painful to wear a bra due to the pressure it caused around my ribs/where the pain is. I was trying everything I could think of to relieve the pain. At first I tried ibuprofen, Tylenol, heat, ice, heating pad, icy hot, cbd muscle rub, cannabis,  \nThe pain continued on and I started talking to my then primary doctor, I had an x-ray done of my ribs 04/2020 - which showed normal. I then had a chest x-ray and chest CT done 05/2020 - also normal. The pain continued through that fall and into 2021. I had c\\*v\\*d for the first time 11/22/2020.  \nIn spring of 2021 I had c\\*v\\*d again in March, so almost right at 90 days since first infection. I then started to get more serious about finding out what was wrong because I started to have a new pain in my left collarbone. It seemed like the whole bone would ache and the more I moved my arms(I had started cosmetology school in the fall of 2020) the worse the pain got. Sometimes the lightest touch from my shirt, a tank top, my cosmetology apron, or even my seat belt resting on my collarbone would cause immense pain. This lasted about a couple weeks at first, then it would go away for weeks/months, then it would come back randomly. I went to the emergency room one day in 03/2021 because I was so tired of being in so much pain, and had more chest x-rays done, which came back clear and normal. The collarbone pain has not bothered me for about 6 months now, but I have also been pretty sedentary since then. Fast forward to 06/15/2022 after my third round of c\\*v\\*d the beginning part of June, I started having the following symptoms for a month straight. I was physically so unwell, I could barely get up from laying down most of the time and could not go outside due to not being able to tolerate the heat, until I finally asked my doctor to run more labs, which all came back normal: dizziness, night sweats, severe intolerance to heat, severe loss of appetite and nausea, and new body odor(previously never had an issue with body odor). Since then, I have had periodic episodes that last weeks with severe loss of appetite(cannabis is the only way I can eat most of the time), some mild nausea(never any vomiting), lethargy, feeling hopeless, very mild night sweats, hotter body temperature while sleeping. And then I\'ll have weeks where I feel fine except my usual pain. On 01/26/2023 I traveled to Punta Cana for my sisters wedding. I suffered through the pain of sitting for an extended period of time on the plane ride. While there, I virtually had no appetite my first night and the next morning/afternoon. And then my appetite came back and my pain went almost completely away for almost 4 days, until I went back home. I ate Taco Bell at the airport and had almost immediate pain from sitting on the plane again, and the pain has been present every day since.\n\n01/25/2023 Urology consult: CHIEF COMPLAINT: left sided pain; concern for Nutcracker syndrome.

Have been to 3 rheums, 2 immunologists, a few PCPs, a couple physiatrists, a pain management doctor and a neurologist. Many admit some symptoms are odd and have no real ideas. I sort of gave up, until a few days ago. Unprompted my neurologist told me she always felt like there was something underlying all my weird conditions. I suppose this was furthered by her injecting some Botox into my back and it bruising in what she called a very strange way that shes never had happen. (Except Im not hypermobile, so dont think if its EDS its the h type). I am a 32F, no history of sports beyond middle school, which I think is important. Anyways the symptoms include (and admittedly many may be unrelated, since I dont know just listing them all!):\n\n-chronic b12 insufficiency and malabsorption with oral supplementation/food; I have been injecting monthly for 5 years now. Pernicious anemia and sjogrens ruled out by blood tests. Also other vitamins have been found to be deficient even when Im consuming 200% DV daily through oral supplements alone, not even counting food (at various times vitamin D, and folic acid).\n-chronic migraines which at times result in 8-16 hours of vomiting if not caught quickly.\n-cervical bulging discs with spinal \n-lack of feeling/reduced feeling in extremities which often presents as me partially ripping my nail out of the nail bed (has happened half a dozen times in the past 4 years, once observed by my mother, a PCP, who confirmed the nail was vertical and bleeding everywhere). I have never fully ripped it out though and with pressure and bandages have always been able to reattach it with my mothers guidance. \n-tendonitis in both arms for 11 years now, unresponsive to NSAIDs. Musculoskeletal ultrasound found nothing beyond the tendonitis (no tears etc). \n-labral tears in both hips, one of which a sports medicine surgeon said looked consistent with playing hockey (which I dont). The one hip is painful, which Ive never done a musculoskeletal ultrasound on (only x ray and other imaging). Not sure if the pain is just related to stress on other muscles, or something not caught by imaging. \n-high cholesterol even though Im thin (BMI 19 or so; 140 lbs 59), eat well, and walk a fair amount. \n-adenomyosis\n-recurrent UTIs beginning in early childhood \n-suspected neurogenic bladder (unable to ever fully feel my bladder is empty) \n-lose immunity to vaccines including MMR, hep B, and HPV. Have had various bouts of HPV and required cryotherapy twice to resolve abnormal cells and cervical changes causing pain and bleeding. My mother had endometrial cancer (which she believed related to her being overweight). \n-chronic seasonal allergies/ nothing specific \n-I always get told theres blood in my urine and that I have a yeast infection when I get urine collected (not matter where I am in my cycle) and even though I have had a yeast infection and do not feel symptomatic when physicians have observed this. \n-I have an eye freckle (only one, thankfully); rosacea; often have tonsillitis\n-fatigue and insomnia are my most annoying symptoms. I have done numerous sleep studies and therapy for sleep with no success. \n-once years ago I bleed brownnot period, actual brown colored urinea few days after having bad pain in my lower back. Ultrasound ruled out kidney stones, which my father suffers from. \n\nI know this is a long list and much of it is probably unrelated, so any ideas of potential leads would be amazing. Thank you!'"

I tried to keep it as short as possible but its all been a little over a year since it all started.\n\nAbout a year ago my (24F) hairline started receding. I figured it was either the new shampoo I was using or the fact that Id felt a few pimples along my hairline and constantly kept digging around for more (sorry, I love popping pimples lol) so when I noticed my hair thinning I stopped the shampoo and tried my best to stop picking and some little hairs started coming back.\n\nLater I developed red rashes along my hairline, just enough under the hair that you couldnt see them from my face, and the back of my neck towards the bottom of my scalp. They were itchy but really only when Id hadnt washed my hair in a day or two.\n\nNow the rashes come and go but my scalp has started to feel grainy. I have mild dandruff but these grains arent skin flakes theyre harder and I can pick them out and look at them. Ive had them for a while and havent seen any lice so its safe to rule eggs out, imo.\n\nI saw a dermatologist and he didnt see anything concerning (I wasnt having a rash flare up and didnt have these grains yet) but he did a hair pull test and nothing abnormal. We did blood work and everything came back fine. He attributed it to stress.\n\nIm not sure if this is related but around the same time my hair started to recede my eyelashes started growing straight down. I always had very long lashes with a beautiful natural curl, people would ask me if they were fake all the time. Now theyve dulled a bit in color and its almost impossible to get them back to what they were even with a lash curler and a lash lift (essentially a perm for your lashes). I can barely even see through them. It might sound silly but this is a huge insecurity of mine.\n\nI have two older sisters, 26 and 28, and neither have these issues. No past family hair loss issues. I only take anticonvulsant medications because I have epilepsy but my neurologist said hair loss shouldnt be a side effect of any.

Im F(15/16), half Thai so I got quite some melanin in my skin. I started getting acne at age 8/9 (by that I mean Im turning 9 that year). It only got worse and in November 2018 I started tetracycline, worked pretty fine, but after almost half a year of it and trying to go without it, immediate outbreak. I ended up using tetracycline until last fall. At a certain time I stopped getting receipts while I was waiting to get back to a dermatologist. Beginning of December was when I finally started isotretinoin after half a year of consultations. 2 first week I did 20mg every other day, and by the time I began taking one pill every day. The symptoms got wild.\n\nAbout 3 days before Christmas I started experiencing daily nosebleeds, sometimes 3 to 5 times a day. My skin was sensitive, red, flaky, my lips was always drying out, flaked, bled- even my eyes are dry, my throat is dry, I easily become hoarse, my fucking ass is dry. A lot of headaches, joint pains, my back is killing me on a daily basis (and I used to dance for 5/6 years). I got to lower my dosage to 20mg every other day again (Im technically about halfway into my accutane treatment), the symptoms arent too bad now, but Im still sensitive. \n\nIve grown sensitive to milk, something I once drank over a liter of on a daily basis- very fat dairy product upset my stomach, so does bacon out of all things. Another funny thing is cum. Yes you heard that right. I had an allergic reaction to someones cum. Just jerked an ex, got his cum on my hand, immediately stung. It BURNED, swell up, red, itched, like acid! This was in early January and I still have flaky skin where it reacted and it looks like eczema. I know of seminal plasma hypersensitivity but it is such a rare thing. Has anyone else here experienced this? TBH, it only got worse now since the covid lockdown, disinfectants, frequent hand washing- it really irritates and dries me out. It also made me think of how I dont look forward until summer. Last year I got sunburnt for the first time in my life. In my face. I live within the damn polar circle where it doesnt get much higher than 15 Celsius. That was while I was on tetracycline. What Im scared and relieved about is that my treatment is ending in sometime June.\n\nHave any of you guys dealt with anything similar or heard of? \n\nHow do you deal with overly sensitive skin? \n\nHow do you suggest I protect my skin in the summer besides the obvious sun screen (I got 50+ spf, UVB + UVA protection that is meant for the face and fragrance free)\n\nAny other suggestions or advice?'"
penicillin problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/za4kkk/anxiety_around_anaphylaxis_to_medication/,b'Anxiety around anaphylaxis to medication',,"b'I get bad panic attacks when trying new medications/ new foods due to a fear of having anaphylaxis. I have had a bad reaction to penicillin when I was younger but thats it. I was in hospital yesterday and received 4 doses of clindamycin through an IV and then have been sent home with clindamycin capsules to take at home. \n\nEven though I was fine with it in hospital, taking the tablets gave me massive anxiety for some reason and when I took them earlier, after about 15 minutes, I felt really weird and then felt like my breathing was getting restricted, fast heart rate, just felt awful, which has made me even more anxious about taking my next dose. This lasted around 20/25 minutes I think but fluctuated.\n\nBasically I think I just need reassurance that Im not going to have an allergic reaction as this wouldve happened by now and I was just panicking earlier? Also, if I had been having a reaction earlier then it wouldnt have stopped by itself would it or have happened like this?\n\nWas symptoms do you experience apart from problems breathing when you have an anaphylactic reaction? Do hives start instantly?\n\nI know this all sounds ridiculous but its really got in my head now haha.\n\nThanks'"
barbiturate problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/88ze58/just_need_to_vent_and_get_this_out_of_my_system/,b'Just need to vent and get this out of my system - doctors unwilling to try alternatives',,"b'I think I\'ve posted here maybe once before.\n\nI have a diagnosis of bipolar II - depression prominent. I\'ve never felt euphoric or had mania although I\'ve had periods that doctors and healthcare staff thought were hypomania, but not necessarily with a great increase in mood (stuff like severe agitation and having to leave the house and be constantly busy and physically moving, otherwise I\'ll ""go down"" if I stop; periods of staying up for 3 days at a time unable to sleep even with medication; periods where I start a million and one things and finish zero of them).\n\nI\'ve always been in the middle with the diagnosis - it was made by a private consultant psychiatrist so someone with great experience and skill, however, I personally feel as though I never really have felt ""happy"" let alone euphoric. Some doctors have suggested drug resistant depression, others just depression and anxiety, others see that the diagnosis was made by a consultant and just agree with it due to the hierarchy on the healthcare system. \n\nI have been on and tried the following medications: \n\nFluoxetine\nCitalopram\nMirtazapine\nSertraline\nQuetiapine \n\nFluox was stopped after 8 weeks as it did nothing for me at all at the time and made my moods even less stable. Citalopram worked for 8-10 months, but I gained over 3.5st in weight and lost all sexual appetite, desire and had problems with erections and ejaculations. In the end, the mood lifting effects stopped working and I just got side effects which led to anger problems, and I came off it when I started being angry all the time that I\'d smash things. \n\nMirtazapine I was on for around 2 years - it did ZERO my mood but was a perfect sleep aid which was great at the time as I was at university. So I hung on to it like a life jacket even though my mood got lower and lower and lower. Eventually when I was leaving university I went back to my doctors and told them that even at 45mg it was not touching my mood. I had few side effects with mirtazapine compared to SSRIs, it just didn\'t work. We came off it. \n\nThen I was put on Sertraline in 2014 and I stayed on it until 2017, so over three years. It worked amazing at first with regards to my mood, then we kept having to increase the dose and I went through hypomanic episodes and thus quetiapine was introduced. After a few months quetiapine was stopped due to weight gain, being tired ALL the time (14 hours asleep anyone?) and the fact it lowered my mood hugely. I stayed on Sertraline for a while but as we increased the dose the sexual side effects got more pronounced, similar to citalopram. I met a guy last year and this became a huge problem, so my doctor agreed to try weaning off it. It took around 3.5 months.\n\nUnfortunately within 3 months my depression was back and by this point I had taken a job in the emergency services working for the police, as a 999 call handler. I had a week with 6 preventable, avoidable deaths regarding car accidents, suicides and such like and my anxiety SOARED --  and my mood plummeted ever since.\n\nOn January 3rd we started me back on Sertraline. I\'m back at 150mg which used to be my ""it kind of works but god these sexual side effects are ruining my relationship and self esteem"" dose. Except now it\'s April.... and the Sertraline has not even touched my mood at all. Zero. I am as depressed as ever before, and yet the side effects all started within 4-7 days of starting the medication. So at the moment I am getting side effects for 4 months but no or little noticeable response with regards to depression or anxiety. \n\n2 weeks ago I attempted suicide taking my second barbiturate overdose and then trying to strangle myself. I was assessed twice by the in-hospital psych team and the crisis and home rehab team and was deemed well enough to stay at home and ""go back to my GP"" for my 3rd or 4th referral to the community mental health team. I am still waiting to hear from them. \n\nI keep screaming that I hate SSRIs, and they don\'t care. I want to try bupropion - but it\'s rarely prescribed in this country (UK), may not be available in my area and may not be ""clinically appropriate"" according to my doctor. He said he no longer feels confident dealing with medications or prescriptions as I know more than he does about non-SSRIs and other MH drugs (he said there are 6 drugs he regularly prescribes for depression and that\'s it). He said he wants any medication and prescribing to be done by a psychiatrist, so I have to wait for the referral to go through which could be another few weeks minimum. He told me to stay on Sertraline until then.\n\nAnyone have any experience with bupropion? He told me to print out as much evidence as possible and to fight my case, but that he wasn\'t the right person to hear it. He accused me of trying to emotionally blackmail him in to prescribing, saying if the medication had any toxic effects that it would or could be him standing in the Coroner\'s Court -- I said if I were to jump from a 5 storey building it would most likely end in him standing in the Coroner\'s Court too. We then apologised and he just said to try and get as much evidence as possible for bupropion to present when I see the psychiatrist and if he doesn\'t prescribe it on the NHS, I may consider a private prescription. However he reiterated if it was not prescribed due to it not being ""clinically appropriate"" for me that even paying for a private prescription wouldn\'t help there as the same rules apply. I said if that\'s the case, I will purchase it myself from an IOP -- he said he strongly advised against this, reiterated that was a prescription only drug but admitted it was not a controlled drug, and said essentially he could not stop me if I was that desperate to try it. \n\nThe thing that pisses me off, is he kept saying ""you don know it\'d work"". I said... we don\'t know what will work until we try it. We didn\'t know about fluoexetine, citalopram, mirtazapine, citalopram, etc. and that\'s we gave them a minimum of a 6-8 week trial. He then said maybe look at venlafaxine, to which I replied you mean an SNRI? One that shares like 95% of the side effect profile of SSRIs and similar efficacy? The ones I have such issues with, be it then not working, or them working but causing such side effects that I cannot stand being on them long term. He apologised.\n\nIt\'s like this. Over here in the UK, SSRIs are cheap, safe and given out like sweets.\n\nThey all work primarily on maintaining higher serotonin levels in the brain.\n\nBut I don\'t get along with them.\n\nCoincidentally, some of the most effective antidepressants are MAOIs - which don\'t significantly work on serotonin, yet can show great results. However they are old, there are side effects relating to your diet and require blood monitoring when on them as they are potentially very dangerous. They are rarely prescribed. MAOIs are not SSRIs or SNRIs and does not share the same side effect profile.\n\nBupropion isn\'t an SSRI either and it too does not share the same side effect profile. It is rarely prescribed here.\n\nNow call me insane, but this just reeks of politics, money, and the ""SSRIs are the silver bullet!"" bandwagon that\'s been rolling ever since the creation of Prozac.\n\nAm I really that unreasonable wanting to give a drug a TRIAL and a) not expecting them (NHS) to pay for it and b) realising it may not work and hence would be a trial.... like every other drug when they\'re first prescribed to me?\n\nArgh.

NSAID eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/ffnb7b/well_i_was_optimistic_about_this/,"b'Well, I WAS optimistic about this.'",,"b'Hello. I am not excited that any of us are on this subreddit, but at least we have each other?\n\nI\'m a 26 year old female, somewhat active and not overweight. In October 2019, I ran a 5K that involved obstacles. I felt great during it and had a lot of fun. I can\'t pinpoint exactly when my injury happened, but I have to assume that it happened during one of the 6 ft wall jumps. I woke up the next day feeling slightly tender in my hamstring area on the right side. I assumed that this was what it felt like to pull a hamstring and I decided to just give it a rest and let it heal on its own. \n\nI stopped running for about 2 weeks and then started up again. I was feeling very sore in the hamstring area but didn\'t really think anything of it. Then it started to get worse. I distinctly remember standing up out of my car and I felt a shooting pain that brought tears to my eyes. It never really got better from there. Around the first of the year, I scheduled an appointment with an orthopedic doctor that my friend had recommended to me. I was still thinking at the time that the problem was with my hamstring. I had no clue that it was related to my back. He manipulated my leg moved me around, and almost instantaneously said, ""this has nothing to do with your hamstring - this is related to your L5S1."" He said that because I am young he recommended that I go through physical therapy and stretches and then follow up with him in about a month.\n\nI got about two weeks into physical therapy, and was feeling pretty good. I was still hurting when I stood up and when I stretched, but the shooting pains were a lot less painful. Then, I had an appointment one day that involved a resistance band, and my pain got five times worse. All of a sudden, instead of just having hamstring pain when I stretched or stood up, I had pain that radiated from my hip down to my foot 24/7. I kept doing physical therapy thinking it was part of it. Sometimes my foot is tingly and I lose toe sensation. Immediately upon my follow up appointment a month later, my doctor ordered an MRI.\n\nThe MRI showed not only a herniation with impingement at L5S1, but also a herniation at L4. While I was disappointed to learn that it was a little bit more serious than I had originally thought, it was good to finally have a diagnostic answer.\n\nWe have stopped the physical therapy for now, but I am in so much pain and it only gets worse by the day. I can\'t do any of the Stuart McGill big 3 exercises because it hurts too much. The doctor prescribed me 1,200 mg per day of Gabapentin, but I can never get past 600 per day (Even if I take most of it for bed) without being utterly useless at work. I basically feel like I am drunk even on the lower doses. \n\nWith the opinion of a second spine specialist at the same clinic, they recommended that I get an epidural steroid injection. I received my steroid injection on Wednesday March 4th, but so far the pain has only increased, and it has been 5 days since the injection. I have gotten no relief from the first injection. The clinic where I received my injection said that I may need to come back for a second injection, but part of me does not want to even waste my time if that won\'t work either. I am desperate because I am half hopeful that the steroid injections will work, but I am half pessimistic that they will not do anything like the first shot. The spine specialist told me that if these injections are not working for me, my follow-up on March 20th may involve a sit-down conversation with a surgeon. I wanted to be one of those people in this sub who healed simply from stretching, but I can\'t even do that. I am so frustrated and I just want my life back.\n\nI can\'t drive without intense pain, I can\'t sleep well at all no matter how many positions or pillows I try, I can\'t sit through work or get anything done, I can\'t do household chores either. Even trying to take NSAIDS or acetomenophen (or both) with or without the Gabapentin has not worked.\n\nSometimes I scroll through this sub and see people who have had this pain for years and have not gotten an MRI yet or people who manage to get past the pain using the Stuart McGill methods. And I have no idea whether or not I am being overly dramatic thinking that surgery may be the only choice I have left 5 months post injury. I have stopped bothering to talk to Friends my age about this issue because they all start spouting out random things about yoga as if I can even slightly bend my knee without pain.'"

No idea what set them off.  It started as a small rash on one of my calves.  No biggie put on some hydrocortisone cream... didn't work.  So I dug out my big guns, prescription steroid cream... didn't work.  What the hell...  So I took 50mg Benadryl.  An hour and a half later, the symptoms were spreading, and I had a rash/hives all over both of my legs, my face was swelling, and I was itchy all over.  Took another dose of 50mg of Benadryl.  When that didn't work an hour later, I headed to the ER.  They gave me IV benadryl, steroids, and Pepcid (didn't realize that it has anti-inflammatory properties, but evidently it does).  Itching and hives were brought under control, YAY!\n\nBut here's my PSA:  The doctor told me because I take daily allergy medicine (Zyrtec-antihistamine and Flonase-local corticosteroid), and the Zyrtec is an antihistamine, it can undermine the effectiveness of Benadryl (a stronger antihistamine), which is likely why the Benadryl I took at home didn't stop the reaction.

Tetracycline problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/ynr4a7/my_personal_guide_to_how_i_cleared_the_majority/,b'My Personal Guide to How I Cleared the Majority of my Acne',,"b'  \n\n**Revised:** after some helpful feedback Ive made some changes to suggestions made in my guide. Please let me know if you have anything that you dont agree with, as I am always open to discussion!\n\nHey everyone! I have been wanting to make this for a while because I have had a long journey with acne and helping others deal with this health condition has always been something I wanted to do.\n\nFirst, this is what worked for me! Unfortunately, everyone is different and may or may not experience positive results; however, it is my belief that there is a lot of helpful information here for everyone!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Basics**\n\n\\- Any acne treatment starts with a good skincare routine. This should include salicylic acid in some form, a gentle cleanser, and a moisturizer + SPF. \n\n\\- Moisturizers are extremely important even for oily skin\n\n\\- SPF SPF SPF! I recommend something like Cerave daily SPF, the sun is one of the worst things for causing skin damage and SPF is so important!\n\n\\- No Picking or Squeezing! Rub ice on pimples for a couple of minutes, twice a day. If you pick, squeeze, and break the skin, that scab will leave a red mark. \n\n\\- I often cant avoid picking/squeezing: If you must squeeze, do so with a metal tool designed for extraction that is sanitized and apply salicylic acid to the area or ice to bring down inflammation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lifestyle**\n\n\\- Never use fabric softener or dryer sheets on any pillowcases, towels, washcloths, or sheets! The wax can get on your skin and clog pores.\n\n\\- Use a gentle detergent for sensitive skin that is fragrance free.\n\n\\- Do not touch your face, the more your hands touch your face the more you introduce bacteria, oils, and other irritants.\n\n\\- Sleep: get as much sleep as possible, youre aiming for 7+ hours\n\n\\- Stress: try using exercise or medication, yoga, etc. To reduce stress as it is a huge cause of skin problems.\n\nFoods Which May Cause Acne (For me)\n\n\\- Dairy products (milk, cheese, especially low/nonfat, whey protein) \n\n\\- Soy products \n\n\\- Red and processed meat\n\n\\- Products with iodine or Iodized salt\n\n\\- Seaweed, kelp, miso soup\n\n\\- Highly processed foods (cookies, cakes, potato chips, French fries, white breads).\n\n\\- Products high in sugars\n\n\\- Drinks (pop, juices, energy drinks).\n\nFoods Which May Help Inflammation\n\n\\- Green tea\n\n\\- Fatty fish (Salmon, mackerel, herring, white fish, halibut)\n\n\\- Berries and fruits low in sugar\n\n\\- Any vegetables\n\n\\- Replace everything you can with a ""whole grain"" alternative\n\n\\- Drink as much water as possible!\n\n\\- Generally, anything with a low glycemic load and index is good for acne!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Supplements That May Help**  **ALWAYS CONSULT A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER**\n\n\\- Zinc tablets 50-100mg  use short term and discontinue once skin clears\n\n\\- Turmeric capsules\n\n\\- Vitamin A  use cautiously as high vitamin A levels are extremely dangerous\n\n\\- Vitamin E\n\n\\- Vitamin D  1000iu\n\n\\- Avoid multivitamins with biotin and iodine\n\n\\- Probiotics are great, especially if you have used doxy, minocycline, tetracycline, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skincare**\n\nSkincare is particularly important (obviously). My current nighttime routine is:\n\n1. Wash face with Cerave gentle cleanser or Oxy salicylic acid wipes\n\n2. Use a hydrating serum (such as Vichy mineral 89 or any hyaluronic acid)\n\n3. Use salicylic acid as a spot treatment if needed (The Ordinary Salicylic Acid Serum)\n\n4. Apply a high-quality moisturizer (The INKEY list multi-biotic moisturizer)\n\n5. Apply retinoid (prescription) every other day or every three days depending on dryness.\n\na. Change pillowcase every night if possible\n\nb. In the morning I do the same except I replace retinol with SPF (The Ordinary SPF) or (Cerave SPF all in one moisturizer). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Makeup**\n\nLoose powder and mineral make-up tend to be best. I use (Burts Bees 100% Natural Mattifying Foundation). Im male so I can get away with lighter coverage easier due to public gender standards. \n\n\\- It is especially important to wash your face well if using makeup! \n\n\\- Natural oils like coconut are among the most pore clogging ingredients you can use.\n\n\\- Make sure to read the label for ingredients like coconut oil \n\n**Potential Prescriptions / Treatments**\n\n\\- Antibacterial creams (prescriptions) can work well in the short term but generally do not work long term as bacteria builds resistance. \n\n\\- Retinoids/retinol is a better option in my opinion to use long term.\n\n\\- I Personally cant use Benzoyl peroxide, it bleaches everything, and I react poorly to it, but its effective for many people\n\n\\- Prescription retinoids often come combined with an antibiotic, these can be great options to get acne under control.\n\n\\- Oral antibiotics like doxycycline, minocycline, etc. can be used short term.\n\n\\- In stubborn cases Accutane may be prescribed, it works well but may have significant side effects.\n\n\\- Hormonal treatments like birth control and anti-androgens (spironolactone) can be used in females, these both have side-effects that you should talk to your doctor about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Closing**\n\nFollowing this guide may or may not lead to positive results for your acne. In my experience this has nearly cured me of my cystic acne. I have never used Accutane, but I think it is important to include it here for potential treatment.\n\nYou may not be able to follow everything in this guide but just know that everything makes a difference! Good luck!'"

This free radical then has the ability to produce other ROS, such as peroxides, resulting in oxidative damage that may include lipid peroxidation and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines.

Lipid peroxidation of fatty acids and unsaturated triterpenes, such as squalene, generates both intracellular and extracellular ROS. The generation of ROS can alter the viscosity and composition of sebum.5,14 In fact, the excessive sebum production in acne is expected to promote the generation of excess ROS, leading to oxidative stress within the follicle, thus overwhelming the antioxidant system of the skin.5,14""\n\nThe article goes on to explain how the domino effect then happens to other areas of the skin, resulting in scarring, follicle impaction etc and recommends research into the use of topical anti-oxidants.\n\nHappy to chat about this with people as this is my area of expertise, and suggest some anti-oxidant therapies.'"

As a kid it never actually affected me (we have had cats my whole life up until Sept 2019) but over the years it got worse. If I was cuddling/patting my cat and I hadn't taken an antihistamine that day, I would slowly develop swollen, super itchy, watery eyes and a splotchy red rash on my face/neck - but when this happened I would take an antihistamine and the reaction would calm down soon enough. Ever since losing our last cat in September 2019, my allergy has got worse and antihistamines don't help any more. Any time I am around someone else's cat and I'm interacting with it in some way, after 40mins-1hr my eyes start getting itchy and swelling up.  I've recently had to switch to extra strength telfast pills + corticosteroid nose spray + allergy eye drops every day (my usual loratadine pills weren't cutting it anymore because it's been a VERY bad hayfever season where I live). I thought being on stronger antihistamines (and taking them religiously every day) would make me less sensitive to cats but I still get the same reaction. It seems like my body was more desensitized to cats when I had one and was around them every day, but now I haven't been living with any cats for a while, I've become super sensitized to it. It's like the antihistamines don't even make a difference to my cat allergy anymore. This is pretty gutting for me as my family would like to get another cat but I actually don't think I would be able to cope with my allergies. Is desensitization therapy my only route here? Is there anything else that has helped anyone with cat allergies? Life isn't fair when you're a huge animal lover with a cat allergy lol"""

The pain was unbearable so I had no choice. The dentist over there started a root treatment but didnt finish, patched it and said that I should take another appointment asap, but the closest appointment being 3 months away back home. \n\nFast forward to 10 days ago, it started hurting again, I used my brain and figured out that it must be caused by some infection, luckily I had some leftover penicillin which fixed most of the pain. \n\nToday, I had an appointment, supposedly to finish the root treatment but no, I apparently had some infected abscess making it impossible to finish it now so he just drained it and sanitised my tooth. Now, idk wtf he did but the pain that came afterwards is unbearable. Ive been crying the whole day bc of the pain, Its honestly probably the worst pain Ive ever been through and its not even been 24h. The pain is reaching all the way to my ear, whole jaw and even my arm. He took scans of my tooth, everything is in order he said and that the pain would go away within 2 days but I have a hard time believing this as 20 hours later, not even amoxicillin or 5 tabs of painkillers did anything to help. If that keeps going Ill end up ruining my liver from taking painkillers, I will have to miss work and my holidays will be ruined. Not only this by Ill need a liver transplant if I keep taking this many painkillers. Im so tired of having problems with that tooth. \n\nNo amounts of paracetamol, naproxen or parcodin helps.

antimicrobial problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/vh3v6j/multiple_root_canals_failed/,b'multiple root canals failed',,"b""I'm wondering if I have some underlying problem that causes my root canals to fail.\n\nI had a root canal done by a dentist on tooth #21 1.5 years ago and since that time that tooth was giving me pain.  I went to multiple doctors to get opinions, they took X-rays and CBCT scan but could not find anything.  At some point the pain lessened but after 2-3 months returned even worse.  I went to an endodontist who suggested to redo the root canal.  They also took another CBCT scan.  The root canal was redone but the pain didn't stop, it was getting a bit better and then worse but no overall progress.  After 2-3 months i decided to have this tooth pulled.  Oral surgeon who pulled the tooth said I had an infection under the tooth, which was a cause of this pain.  The tooth apparently was not cracked.  I thought that redoing root canal would take care of the infection, but according to them, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nAnyway, long story short, in 3-4 months after this I ended up needing another root canal on tooth #20.  This time I went to another endodontist to do it.  Unfortunately, after 2-3 days that tooth started hurting again.  The pain got worse.  They agreed to undo the root canal and put antimicrobial medication into the canal to see if this will help.  That procedure did not seem to help.  The other thing they did was to give me antibiotics.  I tried several ones, Amoxicillin, Augmentin and Erithromycin which didn't do anything.  The one that did help was Clindamycin, as I felt much better after couple of days.  The pain never really went away completely, but it was minimal for couple of months however then it returned.  The nature of the pain was very similar to what i had for #21, but not as strong though.  The endodontist said there is nothing more can be done about it and suggested for me to get extraction and implant.  This time i decided not to wait a year like i did for #21 and got tooth #20 extracted several days ago.  They also let me take the tooth home, i examined it but didn't find any cracks.\n\nMy question is that what could be going on.  Do i have some persistent infection that causes all my root canals to fail?  I m afraid of the same thing repeating if i need another root canal.  I'm planning to get an implant (or 2) to replace the missing teeth, but also concerned if an implant can fail too for the same reason (infection).  According to the doctor, it is possible the infection was anaerobic, since treating with Clindamycin worked for a while.  However since this also ultimately didn't fix the problem, something else is required.  The root canals were done and redone by different endodontists so it's hard to believe that both did a bad job.  This is a mystery for me.  I asked oral surgeon if they can take a bacterial culture to determine precisely what antibiotic i need, so far they said they normally don't do this kind of thing, but perhaps i need to ask again.\n\nAlso, I had several root canals done in the past, about 20 years ago, and there was no such problem.  Any ideas?"""
codeine problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/xg2t1c/how_i_got_rid_of_my_wisdom_teeth_under_sedation/,b'How I got rid of my wisdom teeth under sedation and created a precedent',,"b'This post contains some advice from one patient\'s personal experience. NAD.\n\nI wrote in r/eesti about my success in getting our equivalent of the NHS to apply a little-known clause in its bylaw. They covered my sedation for wisdom tooth extractions because I have sometimes had difficulties getting fully numb with local and require more local than is normal. Here sedation dentistry is virtually unknown of, even if they dig around in your jawbones for an hour. Some clinics offer sedation and our equivalent of NHS has to cover it in quite a few situations... but most patients don\'t know about sedation at all, doctors don\'t know when it should be covered and wanting sedation is considered extra. It\'s usually reserved for people with severe developmental disabilities.\n\nI\'m so proud that I pestered the clinics, our equivalent of the NHS and finally even our ministry of social affairs - and not just because I saved some money. I created a useful precedent for patients who can\'t have their teeth extracted without sedation. And I contributed to normalising sedation for dental surgery. I know someone who unlike me can\'t get numb at all and he had his wisdom teeth pulled awake. That\'s barbaric and I\'m doing my best to inform the other patients about their options.\n\nI assume that the nuances of our medical bureaucracy are of little interest to most English-speking readers, but my original post that started as a guide to the bureaucracy got a bit out of hand, and I also wrote about my experience with sedation and recovery. So I decided to translate those parts of my post for the benefit of other highly sensitive patients. A few redditors who are considering extractions seemed to appreciate the level of detail.\n\nSorry for any awkward grammar. If you find some particularly egregious error, I\'d love if you point it out since I\'m trying to improve :)\n\nThis post is long. Even by my standards. I think all of my posts in r/eesti have gotten at least one more or less snarky comment about their length. I want to write about my experience as honestly and vividly as I can.\n\nIf you know someone who has been putting off extracting their problematic wisdom teeth due to abnormally high pain sensitivity or bad dentist experiences then maybe my post can help them get it done while avoiding unpleasant issues during recovery.\n\nI have split this post into two parts - my experience with sedation, and other tips for abnormally sensitive people. I also started both parts with a TLDR and have tried to use some bold font to make it a bit more readable.\n\n**MY EXPERIENCE WITH SEDATION**\n\n**TLDR:** I read that some patients have success with oral anxiolytics or laughing gas but concluded that those aren\'t a good fit and I should go with IV sedation. There was nothing physically unpleasant about sedation and the recovery was quick but waking up under the influence of drugs in a white room with stitches in your mouth can result in some major panic. I do think that sedation was the only reasonable option for me and I would have really regretted doing the operation awake.\n\nI briefly considered an oral anxiolytic. My GP prescribed me alprazolam (Xanax) for dental visits and I used it for the last two fillings. It turned out that the effects of alprazolam on me, at least in the small doses I have tried, are a big fat nothing. I do hope that a more substatial dose or a different drug might help. I\'ll ask my GP or a psychiatrist to help find the right drug and dosage that would take the edge off during normal dental visits. But something as serious and potentially painful as a wisdom tooth extraction is not the time to experiment with a drug that MIGHT eliminate SOME of the problems.\n\nSome clinics offer both laughing gas and IV sedation. I strongly preferred the second option since I\'ve read that IV sedation is better if the patient has extreme anxiety and laughing gas can cause nausea and a headache, especially if you have to breathe it for a whole hour. Fortunately it turned out that my clinic employs only IV sedation.\n\nSedation is much easier than GA. They don\'t intubate you, you breathe independently with a bit of supplemental oxygen that is given non-invasively via some tubing under your nose. I was explained that unlike with GA I won\'t be given any drugs that can cause vomiting after the operation. So if you\'ve heard bad stories about coming out of GA or experienced it for yourself - sedation is different.\n\nDoctors sure are weird. They seemed very invested in making me look away during IV insertion and warned that the drug will burn. Considering why I was there, those seemed to be the least of my problems.\n\nI don\'t remember anything from the moment the IV was inserted and I felt a slight burn and pleasant warmth in my hand. **Going to sleep happened in a couple of seconds and felt very comfy.** I\'ve read that some patients have some fuzzy bits of memories since it\'s not GA, but most aren\'t bothered by it.\n\n**The physical and cognitive part of waking up was easy.** I felt no nausea whatsoever. For the first few minutes I didn\'t feel any pain except the pinch of my IV being removed. I don\'t remember any confusion. My thinking cleared very quickly. When the anesthesiologist was talking to the surgeon and recommended ibuprofen for postop pain I asked whether it\'s safe to take etoricoxib and ibuprofen together since they\'re both cyclooxygenase inhibitors. (The nerd is strong in this one.) When they made me stand up I almost passed out. I started lowering myself towards the floor, and then someone offered me an office chair and wheeled me to the recovery room.\n\nThe psychological part of waking up was a whole other story. **I was crying like crazy even before my pain sensitivity returned.** I woke up in complete panic - I wasn\'t confused or unresponsive, I understood very well what was going on and could hold a reasonable conversation between sobs, but I was extremely afraid and irritated. That happens, especially in younger people, women and those with a history of medical procedure trauma. You shouldn\'t be ashamed, it\'s not under your control. And it\'s certainly nothing compared to what would have happend if I hadn\'t chosen sedation. I\'m mentioning it just so you don\'t have any unpleasant surprises and so that you are kind to yourself if it happens.\n\nOne redditor who has anxiety was put off by this description and it might have influenced him against sedation. **If you are an easy crier or are traumatised by medical procedures you might want to ask if they can wake you up with a family member or friend present** \\- someone\'s got to drive you home anyways. It\'s much harder to tailspin into a panic attack if someone you love is holding your hand and knows what are the right things to tell you when you feel bad. (Telling me to calm down only makes me cry more!)\n\nStill, to reassure you, everything about sedation - except the condescending and irritable attitude of the surgeon, which made the panic attack so much worse - is something that I wouldn\'t be afraid to repeat if it was necessary. Going to sleep was very pleasant. Waking up (when considered separately from postop ick like blood in your mouth and pain - which you would experience anyways) wasn\'t as bad as I expected.\n\nThe fact that sedation is normal in the US for wisdom tooth extractions, and not only for special needs patients, should tell you how safe it is. The fact that here most patients suffer it awake unlike in the US is purely a question of cultural norms and money, not risks.\n\nBy the way, the awful pain a few minutes after waking up tells me that the local failed partially and **doing the operation awake with my history would have been the dumbest idea ever.** Keep in mind that a tooth extraction is difficult to stop once the tooth is broken. If you have any doubts about your ability to let the doctor finish the job while you\'re awake, demand sedation.\n\n**ON CHOOSING THE DOCTOR; ON POSTOP PAIN AND RECOVERY**\n\n**TLDR:** You might be the 1% who can\'t handle it without prescription painkillers and extends your sick leave well into the second week. Speak up before the operation and not when you are already feeling awful and it hurts to speak. Don\'t trust the doctor if they promise to handle pain as it happens and refuse to discuss it preemptively.\n\nThose tips are especially important for a highly sensitive patient. There are things the docs don\'t tell you because, after all, every patient is a statistical average. And the internet is a great evil because if a patient doesn\'t read about the bad experiences they might not notice if it happens to them. \\\\s\n\n\\- **Don\'t take it lightly.** It\'s an hour of digging around in your jawbones and not removing a mole. Recovery can be long and painful even if the operation goes ideally, like mine. Nerve damage can be serious and sometimes, rarely, permanent. Nerve damage can mean a numb lip or tongue, changes in taste perception or even chronic pain. Two of my wisdom teeth had to go because one was trying to grow into the root of the neighboring tooth under a 45-degree angle and the other was a gum infection risk. If some of your wisdom teeth have come in nicely and don\'t hurt, and extraction is recommended only because poor hygiene might result in a cavity ten years later or your orthodontist wants more space to work with, then I\'d seriously ask yourself if it\'s worth so much pain. And don\'t expect the doctor to warn you about the risks adqeuately. The surgeon described the possibility of nerve damage as ""might pull out some nerve fibers"" and if I hadn\'t read up on the internet then I wouldn\'t know what it actually means. I had a successful operation and my IAN is completely intact. But you might have bad luck. I know that in the age of vaccine skepticism and the ivermectin craze this phrase might sound off to some, but still - **do your research.**\n\n\\- **If you decide to do it awake then listen to your gut when consulting with the doc.** Several reviews about teeth pulled without sufficient numbing, treating sedation or an extended sick leave as some kind of a whim and not a necessity, a sour mien if you\'re worried and ask reasonable questions, and an irrational fear of prescription painkillers are all red flags. Considering how the surgeon was talking to me while I was waking up and how she refused to treat my pain, pulling the teeth while awake would have been a terrifying experience. She might be skillful and I\'m glad she saved my IAN during a complicated extraction but in all other respects being treated by her was an experience that undid much of the work I\'d done on my fear thanks to my excellent new dentist.\n\n\\- **Don\'t let them extract teeth from both sides at the same time** unless you want to eat baby food and yogurt for a month and skip candied almonds for one more month. I\'m glad that I decisively refused the surgeon\'s suggestion to pull the third tooth just in case. The side that was operated on might hurt and be useless for a long time. One non-damaged side speeds up the return to a reasonable diet so much.\n\n\\- **Consider the possibility of a longer recovery when you\'re picking the time.** Don\'t assume that if someone you know took two ibuprofen and resumed work the next day then you will too. Keep in mind that your face might look swollen or bruised for a week and speaking even for a very short time might hurt a lot for the first few days. If you are a student, an instructor or a grown-up who has signed up for some fun course then don\'t get your teeth extracted in the middle of the term hoping that you\'ll recover in a couple of days. And don\'t get your teeth extracted less than two weeks before a party that you would be sorry to miss. **I\'m very much disappointed in my stupidity - I assumed that I would be able to go to a concert three days after the operation.** \\#NotAStatisticalAverage\n\n\\- **It\'s better to get it done in the first half of the working week** \\- especially if you\'re optimistic and agree to do it without a preemptive prescription for stronger painkillers. It\'s nice if for the first two or three days you can reach your surgeon or GP by phone at least during daytime. This might spare you a visit to the ER.\n\n\\- **Take sick leave, if you can. As much as you need.** I know that it\'s often challenging or impossible in the US but if it\'s possible, use your sick leave! A code rat doesn\'t deserve any less sick leave than a warehouse worker or a teacher. Be prepared to argue with a doctor or a rude front desk nurse who thinks otherwise. No one should be working in so much pain, even if they can WFH. Mental strain and stress don\'t pull on your incisions but they certainly can make you feel worse. And rest can help you use less painkillers - tell this if a family member or a healthcare worker dares to question your need for a longer sick leave. #NotAStatisticalAverage\n\n\\- **Premedication.** I was given 0.5 g tylenol when I arrived. I should have laughed and told them that I might as well take nothing. If you know from experience that 0.5 g is completely useless for you and you take 1 g even for minor issues or that ibuprofen works better for you or actually you\'d like to take both just in case, then don\'t hesitate to speak up. My second panic attack and a long bout of crying happened in the recovery room just after sedation wore off completely and I understood how much pain I\'m in.\n\n\\- **I was still in an awful amount of pain the next day and the surgeon refused to help me.** I had a prescription COX-2 inhibitor (and I\'m not sure if it did any good - discontinuing it a few days later didn\'t affect my pain much) and OTC tylenol with codeine and ibuprofen. At first those were completely insufficient even when taken all together in maximum doses. I was in so much pain that I couldn\'t drink much water, go to sleep or speak. I took the maximum safe amount of ibuprofen together with the COX-2 inhibitor and because I couldn\'t eat even a decent amount of ice cream I took ibuprofen on an almost empty stomach. (Not a good idea!) You should also consider that the recovery isn\'t linear and you might get some surprisingly nasty pain as a surprise several days later - and Murphy\'s law suggests that it will happen in the evening or on the weekend. **Does your surgeon claim that no one needs opioids for such a ""minor"" thing? That opioids make you drowsy and most patients hate it so much that you shouldn\'t even give it a try? That they will prescribe something stronger but only after the operation, if the need actually arises? RUN.** Don\'t trust that you will get help when you need it. My boyfriend called the surgeon. (I was too sore to speak.) The surgeon told me to meditate and claimed that OTC painkillers aren\'t helping because I don\'t believe in their effectiveness. Fortunately my GP prescribed me tramadol. After I got the pain under control, drank some water and slept the milder painkillers worked much better. Also, while pain isn\'t ""all in your head"" I must admit that having tramadol on hand wasn\'t just good for pain and sleep, it was also a psychological safety blanket that allowed me to cope. I took as little as possible and discontinued it as soon as possible, used less than three pills total and split them, but it was nice having it on my nightstand and thinking ""Yes, it sucks a bit right now. But if it starts sucking more, I can take something stronger anytime I want."" Everybody should know their risks of addiction. Some have an unhealthy attraction to psychoactive stuff, some don\'t. I don\'t. For me, tramadol was very effective against pain and discomfort, that\'s all. Everyone\'s different. #NotAStatisticalAverage\n\n\\- **The best thing you can do to stay comfortable while minimising the use of painkillers and reducing their use as quickly as possible is lots of good sleep.** During the day moderate pain can be ignored with distractions. And you actually want to keep at least a bit of pain during the day to remind you to avoid anything stupid that might disturb the incisions or pull out the blood clot. But that works best if you aren\'t tired and angry after a miserable, sleepless night. If you get your pain fully under control late in the evening and sleep well then next day you\'ll be rested and in a good mood and the total use of painkillers will be greatly reduced.\n\n\\- **If you had a bad experience then ask to book your postop checkup, if you need one, with a different dentist.** My clinic was very understanding about it. The dental surgeon who checked my wounds did his best to not cause any unnecessary pain during the checkup and so graciously kept to himself all the frustrated comments about my sensitivity that were probably going through his head.\n\n\\- Your wound might feel iffy and you might be unsure if it\'s just your hypersensitivity or an infection that requires more antibiotics. **The checkup is another reason why you might need a stronger painkiller.** I timed tylenol, ibuprofen and tramadol so that they all peaked during the checkup. That was sufficient to open my mouth enough to show the wounds. Barely. Nine days after the operation. #NotAStatisticalAverage\n\n\\- The doctor I visited for the checkup suggested flushing the wound. I asked if I can have numbing. He warned that when the tissue is irritated the local doesn\'t work as well. I asked what happens if we don\'t flush the wound. He explained that I don\'t have serious inflammation and the wound will heal, just slower. Because even inspecting the wound hurt despite the doctor\'s best efforts, and caused me to make some funny faces and undignified sounds, I decided that I\'d rather take ibuprofen and avoid chewing on that side a few days longer than let him flush the wound. **If the doctor suggests flushing the wound and you are afraid of it then ask what happens if you don\'t. Maybe it\'s ok to leave as is.** I\'m glad that the doc was honest and took into consideration my sensitivity and not only what would be medically ideal if the patient had a high pain tolerance.\n\n\\- **Please, give feedback**. To the doctor - make them think. To the clinic, as they might want to know if one of their doctors ticked the patient off so much that they\'re badmouthing the place to everyone who will listen. And to the wider public, **because we all deserve not just competent but humane medical treatment.**\n\nTo those who read this chonker of a text to the end - thank you for reading my manifesto about dental care. Know your limits. Don\'t be afraid to ask doctors to employ reasonable and safe accommodations that help you take care of your physical health without causing psychological trauma. Have higher expectations when it comes to bedside manner and both procedural and postoperative pain! You will be helping not only yourself but other patients as well.'"

Due to my age now (52F), I have had 2 annual shingles vax.\n\nI live in a pretty humid midwestern state, and I have seasonal allergies. I just spent a week in Alaska. While visiting, I couldnt believe how amazing I felt. It was as if, after decades of seasonal allergies, I suddenly felt like I did when I was younger I could breathe! No sneezing, itchiness, etc. \n\nSo heres what happened. I flew back from Alaska Friday May 5. Because of the flight time/time zone  difference, I was awake for a total of ~48 hours by the time I returned home. I slept for approx 12 hours. Later on Saturday May 6, I began to feel that old familiar burning sensation of PHN on my back torso. Then as the week progressed and still now, I also developed the worst flare up of eczema Ive ever had. Usually I get a tiny patch under my chin. But this time I have large areas of eczema all over my face and on the back of my neck. Itching is unbearable, and along with the PHN (which has not subsided at all), Im feeling kinda miserable.\n\nI am taking Advil for the PHN and Benadryl and Claritin for the eczema and seasonal allergies, (which returned to their normal levels once I was back in my home state). Edited post to add that I also use Cortisone 10 cream on the eczema patches for itch relief.\n\nMy guess is the stress of being awake for 48 hours, flying in a germy pressurized metal tube breathing recycled air for around 12 hours (including a 3 hour layover in another airport), and then the onslaught of returning to my home environment full of allergens.

Low and behold, when the adult tooth comes in, its noticeably discoloured and misshapen - Im talking a 30 or so degree angle, chocolate brown streaking, and generalized yellow discolouration at the tip of the tooth.\n\nAside from that, everything is pretty straight, good size, and never needed braces. But this front tooth had been a major point of insecurity, people made fun of it, and I avoided smiling with teeth or opening my mouth too much at all cost. \n\nAt 13/14 years old I was getting root canal for a back molar (didnt have dental coverage so it got REALLY bad before we could get it fixed). The dentist pointed it out and asked if I wanted it shaved down so the edge was straight and most the discolouration gone. Obviously, the other (normal) central incisor would be brought down to match. I was ecstatic and agreed without much thought or consulting my parents. Relief of having the most noticeable discolouration passed  pretty quickly. \n\nI wasnt really buck toothed before,  but the width was complimentary to the length (of the non-malformed tooth) and for over 10 years now Ive just felt stubby. Dont get me wrong its better than before, but still a big point of insecurity.\n\nBasically all I hear people talk about/find information on are expensive veneers. But I have concerns with strength (being the central incisors) and cutting caffeine (Im a nurse in a pandemic, sorry the coffee has to stay). \n\nSo if anyone has recommendations on what other solutions I can look into it would be very appreciated!

barbiturate problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/4jj37d/facing_a_bipolar_diagnosis_and_i_am_struggling/,b'Facing a bipolar diagnosis and I am struggling',,"b'I was diagnosed with depression in December 2010, and I have taken a multitude of anti-depressants since then, some effective, some less so - some effective for the first month or three then a major crash, blahblahblah. A list of antidepressants I have been prescribed includes (but may not be limited to the following, I have memory problems) fluoxetine, citalopram, mirtazapine, amitriptyline and sertraline. A doctor once considered venlafaxine but I went for the sertraline instead.\n\nAnyway, I don\'t want to have a huge post so I will try to cut short. My original December 2010 diagnosis was just ""depression"" and then after a few years and multiple different ADs my doctor just said I was suffering from resistant Major Depressive Disorder (i.e. not situational, not going away by itself or with the use of first line drugs). I was offered counselling, I agreed to go - unfortunately I was not told it was a group conselling programme like AA or NA and that was not something I felt comfortable with at the time. I was younger, more anxious and I couldn\'t face it, so I didn\'t go after all.\n\nIn August 2010 I had a weird experience where I became randomly, out of nowhere, excitable, motivated, yet utterly depressed still. I was agitated if I kept still, I could not stay in the house for longer than 30 minutes - I had to keep moving, keep busy. I walked about 7 miles every day and spent around 12 hours outside, alone, from 10am until around 10pm. Doing nothing in particular, I just had to keep moving - when I did, I felt free, I could breathe, I was content and things were good. But when I stopped or sat still, I wanted to kill myself.\n\nI went to my GP as this was not an experience I have had before, thinking it may be a hypomanic or manic state - I know that bipolar is usually misdiagnosed for years. Anyway, she was worried, I had not slept for 3 days, so she referred me to the Community Mental Health Team (CMHT). She gave me diazepam to help me sleep. They didn\'t work.\n\nI was assessed at the CMHT and was deemed low priority due to my diagnosis being ""just"" MDD, and they said they didn\'t think it was a hypomanic or manic state as although there was agitation, no sleep, needing to keep busy etc. my mood was actually low and depressive. Fair enough. So I received almost a year\'s worth of CBT from them rather than any other programs or treatments.\n\nJanuary 2015 I overdosed on barbirurates and benzodiazepines after my boyfriend broke up with me. It was not a suicide attempt, and I am so thankful that I lived, but also that people UNDERSTOOD that it wasn\'t a suicide attempt. It had been around 5+ days since the break up, I was still sad over it, but getting better. The problem was I could not get any sleep at all... after 4 or 5 days of no sleep, you become stupid and reckless. That is how I overdosed on the barbiturates and benzodiazepines. It helped that I had lots of both available and it was obvious that I hadn\'t taken even say 30% of them, whereas apparently people with suicidal intentions take the whole lot. So that was on my side. I didn\'t die, I was OK.\n\nThere have been numerous ups and downs since January 2015, but skip to January 2016. I has been feeling increasingly low since November 2015 and it was getting too much. I was prescribed propranolol for anxiety (benzos were sort of avoided because... well, the above), and my sertraline was raised to 150mg.\n\nAnd it felt fantastic. I had a solid 3 weeks of feeling amazing. My mood was great, I felt the best I had in over a year, I was so motivated, I wasn\'t doing just my own job at work but doing extra work. Fantastic. But two coworkers noticed this sudden change in my behaviour and spoke to our manager saying they were worried about my behaviour and personality change. \n\nMy manager who is a pharmacist suggested it was me probably just getting used to the drugs after the increase. So we gave it a few weeks. The happiness and everything was good, I just kept trying to be less excitable/loud etc. at work so people would not complain.\n\nThen in March/April... major crash. I was having neurological symptoms such as major memory loss and confusion, sleeping for 16 hours in weird places and at weird times... I got an MRI scan and an urgent referral to a neurologist.\n\nThe neurologist has sort of cleared me, he said I have a sleep disorder called REM behaviour disorder meaning I sleepwalk/talk/act and basically I was so tired all the time and sleeping for so long because my ""sleep"" wasn\'t actually restful or refreshing. I was spending too long in REM sleep and my body was acting my dreams out. Spending too long in REM means skipping sleep stages as well which is apparently why I was unable to remember things from the day before... my brain hadn\'t had chance to process them overnight.\n\nLong story short, he wants to prescribe clonazepam for the REM behaviour disorder. But obviously after the January 2015 overdose we have a potential issue there. He said it should be fine, once I spoke candidly about the context of it all, the fact it wasn\'t to get high or suicidal, just a desperate need for sleep, and suggested that we could just do prescriptions for 10 nights at a time for the first few months, if it made me feel better/safer. I thought it was nice how he didn\'t just say ""hell no"" to the clonazepam; in fact it was his suggestion and he basically said there is no other pill we can give you that will work as well for a parasomnia like this. He said I must avoid the three Z sleep drugs cos they can make it worse, and he wants one that will make me sleepy, reduce my REM sleep (I am jumping straight in to REM, so a drug that reduces REM is actually a good thing for me in this situation even though it is a bad thing generally), one that will keep my muscles relaxed (to reduce the likelihood of acting out my dreams and sleepwalking etc.) and one that isn\'t too long-acting like diazepam because I do actually work when I am not on sick leave and any drug needs to be compatible with a normal work life. He also said whilst diazepam is a great muscle relaxer it takes too long to take effect and lasts too long. So clonazepam it is.\n\nBut then at the end, he said we need to get to the root cause of my REM Behaviour Disorder, particularly because it is sort of new and only started a month or 2 ago. I told him about the complaints at work in January, I told him about August 2014... he knew I was depressed, I asked if that could have an impact, he said yes.\n\nThen he said, as well as a neurologist, I am actually qualified in Psychiatry as well, and I am able to work as a Psychiatrist as of 3 years ago. So I am like - this is brilliant, killing two birds with one stone.\n\nThen he says it... ""I think, quite probably, that you have bipolar disorder"". And I have thought it was possible before... In August 2014.... In January 2016............ but I\'m usually so low all the time, I never seem to have any huge manic periods or hypomanic incidents. But he said I was thinking about it too much and had been biased over what I know about bipolar (I teach Psychology) and how I probably think of it as the extremes. He asked if I looked it up before, I said yes loads of times for both personal reasons and work reasons. And I listed all the symptoms I don\'t have... and he was like yes, but the ones that you do have are the most important ones.\n\nSo. Because he saw me that day as a neurologist rather than a Psychiatrist, he would like me to see a second Psychiatrist for a second opinion and formal diagnosis (even though he is qualified, that is not what he was working/employed for at the hospital I saw him at). He said not to worry and how it is a good thing as after 7 years I may finally get things sorted. I cried and said that\'s all I want, to get things sorted. I felt relieved. He said forget the stigma, forget what you read, see or hear, just go see this second Psychiatrist when I get the appointment, and if I am diagnosed with bipolar we can work something out between me and the Psychiatrist and how it will be much better in the long run. I spend 90% of my time depressed and 10% of my time super happy and motivated, but also anxious about when it ends. To have an antidepressant that works would be fantastic and for one to work for longer than a few weeks or months (I always thought that was just the time it took my body to get used to it - turns out it was probably just hypomania from the SSRIs as I was obviously not on a mood stabiliser or anything else) would be a great bonus. I left the hospital feeling relieved but slightly anxious.\n\nThat was 5 days ago. Now my mood is in the gutter, I just feel like crying, and I am so depressed I just want to sleep forever. I will obviously not take anything extra to help with that due to... the reasons previously highlighted. But that is how I feel, really depressed, anxious, tired. I just want to sleep for a week or 3.\n\nSo I don\'t really know what this post is about. I am sorry it is probably just a useless wall of text. I guess I am just facing a potential, more than likely than not, bipolar diagnosis and it feels like a whole new world. Some good, some bad - the goods being I might get better treatment tailored for the condition rather than just having SSRIs thrown at me, the bad being... well, having bipolar.\n\nI know depression is tough. I know bipolar is tough. I know it won\'t be easy. But if anyone would be as kind as to share their stories about how they got diagnosed, what happened immediately afterwards in terms of medication and treatment, and whether you feel better in the long term after being diagnosed. I guess my biggest worry is if I am diagnosed, but if things don\'t get better. If I get the right diagnosis, and the right treatment and things still don\'t start getting better... that is what I am worried about. At the moment I have hope, but also anxiety. Because I really want to feel better. And I don\'t want the label and stigma that comes with being diagnosed as bipolar, if I actually don\'t feel any better for it, if that makes sense?\n\nSorry this is so long. It is almost 3AM here in the UK.\n\nThank you. '"

I recently got put on Doxycycline and I know the general side affects are an upset stomach accompanied by vomiting, but along with those symptoms I'm also having dry, itchy eyes, itchy, dry skin, and I'm just overall feeling unwell, like I can barely function and this is after two days of taking it. I get this reaction while taking Clindamycin as well. These are the only two anti-biotics I know I can take and Doxycycline is new on the list, we just on a whim decided to try it to see if it would work and what my symptoms might be. So far no sign of rash, swelling, or hives, but I've been known to be a slow reactor so we shall see."""
penicillin side effect,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/107uoaf/sharing_ibuprofen_topical/,"b'Sharing: ibuprofen, topical voltarol/voltaren/diclofenac (relatively rare) side effects'",,"b'Just sharing in the event its useful. I took ibuprofen four times a day for two weeks when I was first diagnosed with a slipped disc. Eventually I realised that I was retaining water like crazy (initially I thought I might just be gaining weight). So I stopped and switched to paracetamol (tylenol), which helped a little with my back but not at all with my inflamed nerve. A few weeks later I tried taking ibuprofen once a day since that actually helps the sciatic nerve. But on the second night I woke up with horrific heartburn. So I switched to voltarol gel. And not only did I get heartburn within two minutes of applying it (no joke!), but I swelled up again, my arms started hurting, and I got terrible brain fog as well as bizarre mood swings and crying spells that I associate with the withdrawal symptoms when coming off an antidepressant. Apparently even topical NSAIDs can cause stomach problems and water retention, and all NSAIDs carry the risk of causing depression, nervousness, and mood swings, particularly in people who have affective disorders (eg depression and bipolar). So I thought I would post about it given how many people on here are probably on one NSAID or another.'"

I'd be better of asking my dentist go through the on duty dental doctor (Not verbatim).   \n\n\nAnyway I phoned her back and communicated this and she said that I should come back for her to inspect me again.   \n\n\nShe explained that sinus had been perforated and that I will need to see a specialist and that she'll refer me and in the mean time to take antibiotics. She showed me my xray which illustrated how my roots actually go deep into my sinus floor.  She said it wasn't severe enough to merit going to A&E but if the pain gets much worse to go straight to A&E. (Not verbatim).   \n\n\nOnce I get home after going to the chemist I see that she's prescribed me amoxicillin. I have a suspected allergy to penicillin which has never been confirmed. (I was given it once and had a bad rash come up all over my body.)\n\nI told them on my registration form about my suspected allergy so I was dejected to get home only to realise I cant take the medicine I've been prescribed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Tuesday  I phone and explained and I was told they thought I only had a slight allergy which is why they prescribed me amoxicillin. They then prescribed me Metronidazole instead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis morning the specialist phoned and I'm booked in later today.   \n\n\nNow all in all this has felt quite badly handled from my perspective. I wasn't made aware of the risk of a perforated sinus. I wasn't made aware that I might have to to A&E should that happen. I was sent away completely unaware that I had a perforated sinus. I was then prescribed medication that I have a suspected allergy to.   \n\n\nI would really appreciate some experienced impartial perspective on what has gone on.  \n\nEdit:\nI drink on the weekends and quit smoking two months ago. \n\nThanks in advance !"""

I can't bend down to tie my shoes, can't easily get out of bed, can't scratch my back, can't reach above my head well, etc.\n\nIn general I feel really stiff and achy all day. This has been slowly building for about a year and I have gained a significant amount of weight because it has been more and more difficult to move around. It's not really any kind of acute pain, it's just like a low-grade ache throughout many joints in my body. I originally went to the GP and then later to a rheumatologist. I've had the following bloods and possibly more that I don't remember:\n\nANA, ANCA, CBC, CMP, CRP, ESR, liver, RF, thyroid\n\nAll are normal, so they know it is not arthritis, cancer, or lupus.\n\nI had an x-ray of my back as well and they said it was normal. I have tried various physio exercises but it feels like it inflames me worse.\n\nAs time has gone on I am having trouble just loading groceries on the conveyor belt at the shop, I can't even bend down or forward that small amount.\n\nI have tried various NSAIDs. I had steroids prescribed for 6 days earlier in the year for a random sinus infection and I believe they helped my range of motion somewhat but you're not allowed to take them for more than 6 days.\n\nCurrently if I have to stand up or walk for more than 10 or 15 minutes my lower back begins to hurt so much that I start sweating and get tachycardia. I absolutely have to sit down, there is no option.\n\nI'm not sure what I need to ask for next. My next visit at the rheumatologist was meant to be in 4 months time but I'm going to return to Cypress instead in a few weeks and I want to find another doctor and figure out what is happening.\n\nI do know that previously my doctor wanted an MRI but it could not get approved for medical necessity. I'm not sure what it would have shown. I do know that he told me there is a disease that causes problems in your spine and shoulders but that it only occurs in elderly people and he was 99% sure I did not have that. But I do not remember what the disease was called, there was a language barrier.\n\nI just know that even though I am obese it is not normal for a man my age to not be able to walk around without back pain and heavy breathing.

Tetracycline eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/aocrw4/my_accutane_experience_13_months_post_accutane/,b'My Accutane Experience - 13 Months Post Accutane',,"b""(if this is against community rules please feel free to take it down - I just thought this could be helpful!) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was on Accutane from June 2017 - December 2017, and thought I would share my experience here, and hopefully answer any questions about what it's like before, during, and after. I've broken it up into little categories in case you're only looking for specific information. \n\nMY SKIN HISTORY: \n\nI've had acne since I was about 11 - it was never really that bad, just something that ran in my family, and didn't really think much about. Right before I started high school, it started to get more severe, and I started going to my derm. I was on a couple of different topical prescriptions throughout most of high school, including Differin, Epiduo,  Clindamycin, Dapsone, as well as taking Doxycycline for a while. I still got acne, but it wasn't as bad as it could be, and I just tried to ignore it. \n\nAt the end of my senior year of high school, my acne started to get really bad in a way it hadn't before - I had cystic acne all over my face and even on my jaw, which had never happened before. My derm put me on Tetracycline, but it gave me these weird nose-bleeds that I could feel in my brain, so I just stopped taking it. So I asked her about Accutane, and after the normal pre-accutane shit (blood tests, peeing in a cup, more blood tests, etc) I started taking it. \n\nI think I was on 30mg the first month, then 60mg for a while, and then finally somewhere around 80mg, but I don't really remember. \n\nSIDE EFFECTS: \n\n**I'm going to preface this with: if you feel like accutane is affecting your mental and physical health in any way that does not seem normal, please talk to your doctor and try to figure something else out. I was an idiot who chose vanity over my own health, and I'm still dealing with the consequences.** \n\n\\[PHYSICAL\\] I've always had horrendously dry skin, so accutane didn't actually dry my skin out much more than it already was. My lips got ridiculously dry and cracked, I experienced that weird nose-bleed-but-not things where you just have bloody scabs in your nose the whole time -  I only got an actual nose-bleed once, near the end. My ability to heal took a nose-dive (seriously, I cut the back of my heel on a door about three months in, and it still hasn't completely healed. It's just this weird, slightly raised, purple scar now.)  I was basically in constant, low level bodily pain and always fatigued. I had dry eye, and my vision would constantly blur in bright light and/or darkness to the point where I was effectively momentarily blind in certain environments, and I still can't see as well as I used to when I am facing direct sunlight. I was also short of breath after short walks that would never had made me winded before. I experienced mild hair thinning, as well as my hair being dryer than normal, but that fixed itself after I finished. I completely lost my appetite, and lost probably about 10 or 15 pounds, which I normally wouldn't have considered a negative, but I looked more like a slowly decaying corpse, rather than like I'd started going to the gym more often. \n\n\\[MENTAL\\] I've struggled with depression on and off since I was about fourteen, but figured accutane wouldn't really make that much of a difference. It did. I became more severely depressed than I have ever been, basically living in a fog. I honestly can't remember much of my time on accutane because I was just completely checked out. It upped my suicidal ideation up by about 1000 notches, and I still struggle with suicidal thoughts. I also developed anxiety, which I had never had an issue with before, and it has not gone away. I was also just a major, wildly moody bitch all the time, because of all of the above. \n\nHOW I COPED:\n\nWater is your best friend. Water should always be your friend, but while on accutane, you should be married to it. Get a liter water bottle and drink from it constantly. I think by the end of Accutane I was drinking about 4 liters of water throughout the day. \n\nDevelop a skin-care routine that isn't harsh, but takes care of your skin. Moisturize moisturize moisturize - day and night, and make sure your day-time moisturizer has an SPF. Cetaphil (ironically) breaks me out, so I use Eucerin face wash and moisturizers, an astringent, and tea tree oil to take care of the acne that does occasionally form now.   (Tea tree oil is pretty drying, though, and while I was on accutane I would only use it every couple of days.) \n\nLip balm and aquaphor. Religiously. \n\nSleep regularly and often. The fatigue is terrible, if you get it, and hits at the most random times - don't skimp on sleep, it helps. \n\nEat. As much as you can. Your body is going through hell, and even if you haven't felt hunger in 3 months, you still need to put food in your body so it can keep you going. \n\nIf you usually wear makeup - don't. I know it sucks walking around with a bare face when you have acne, but I think that really helped the accutane do it's job faster, since I wasn't clogging my pores with chemicals. Plus, when your skin gets that dry, it's hard to make anything look good. \n\nRESULTS:\n\nI don't have pictures to post since I never photographed myself when I had bad acne, and I don't even photograph myself all that much these days, but my skin is clear and smooth. (Not-so) amusingly, the literal day after I stopped taking accutane, I woke up with two angry looking white-heads, one on each side of my face, right next to my nose. I Freaked Out, but they went away in about two days. \n\nI had no active acne by the end of the third month, and I was lucky enough that I a) didn't have pitted acne scars, and b) the remaining months took care of most of the scarring and hyper-pigmentation that I did have. \n\nI only break out now if I'm doing something that would have broken me out before accutane - wearing makeup that irritates me, eating too much dairy (I'm actually semi-convinced that accutane made dairy break me out more than it did before, but I have no actual proof of that), or other random things, like nicotine withdrawal. The breakouts that I do get can barely be classified as such, in comparison to what my skin was like pre-accutane. They rarely come to a head, go away after a few days, and don't leave dark red marks that take months to fade. \n\nWOULD I DO IT AGAIN:\n\nNo, never in my life. However, as you can probably tell, I had a really shit run of it, and I probably shouldn't have continued taking it, but my blood tests were always fine, so I figured it probably wasn't going to kill me or anything. It worked, that is for sure. Everybody has different reactions, and as I said above, please talk to your doctor if something doesn't feel right - having severe acne sucks in a lot of ways, but there are other ways to manage it, and your well being is the most important thing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: Accutane sucks, but it's (mostly) worth it.** """

I\'m not currently working, smoking pot or taking Concerta.**\n\n* **Anticonvulsants lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine have helped with mood swings, but I am unable to focus**\n\n* **Ketogenic diet has helped with brain-fog, but it has not been the magic bullet I\'ve been looking for (although I did lose 50 pounds)**\n\n\nI\'m 40 years and was put on **40mg of Ritalin** when I was around 6 or 7. That amount was raised to **60mg** when I was 11. I was taken off it suddenly when I entered HS, because that\'s what they did back then.\n\nAfter years of study problems at college, I started taking it again around age 20, this time taking it as needed, in **5 or 10mg** dosages, typically **20mg a day** but as much as **30mg** if I had a lot of studying. For whatever reason, I\'ll stop taking it after some time. Maybe my insurance changed or I felt it was just making me too edgy, but I always stop and then I start to have problems with work (I am a programmer, I need to focus). \n\nI started **smoking pot on a daily basis** around the age of 23, which helped me focus and and reduced my anxiety, but over time, it creates more anxiety as I\'d be constantly worried about running out, running to pick up, etc. It is a bank-account draining, PiTA and given the volume that I need to smoke when I smoke, it\'s better to not smoke at all. \n\nI struggled a bit with controlling my cannabis use in my late 20s/early 30s. I\'d feel better not smoking, but I would get very, very depressed and occasionally have a manic episode. \n\nI thought maybe I was addicted to cannabis and that these were withdrawal symptoms. I went cold turkey for 3 years and began exercising intensely and the symptoms only got worse. \n\nBy this point, I had tried a few **SSRIs**. I would take them out of desperation, they\'d get me out of my funk, but after a while I would just feel like a vegetable and I would have to stop taking them.\n\nThe doctor I saw suggested I try **Wellbutrin**. Almost immediately, I felt ""normal"". It gave me a lot of energy, also, but the energy would just keep growing and growing until I would snap and do something harmful to myself like throw my bicycle at the wall because of some perceived insult. He tried pairing it with **Lamictal** to stabilize my mood, but that didn\'t work.\n\nI stopped taking the **Wellbutrin**, and I went on **Concerta**. I was hesitant, but the doctor really upsold it. It worked very well, with some caveats:\n\n* It was brand new, so there was no generic and I knew I was getting the best quality drug\n* It still had the anxiety inducing side effects that had me resorting to cannabis to balance out. \n* I don\'t like being on it all day and would rather take as needed. **36mg** is not enough and **54mg** is too much and my insurance won\'t cover any more than 1 pill a day, so 27mg once or twice a day is not an option.\n\nThis was about five years ago or so, and I\'ve been caught in this loop of giving up and going back.\n\nI\'ve lost a lot of faith in the medical profession, especially the mental health wing. For years, doctors have been telling me to eat low-fat, lots of grains, blabbity blah blah. I\'d been vegetarian on an off most of my adult life, overweight my entire life and up until about 10 months ago, I had been on a vegan diet. The vegan diet caused my triglycerides to skyrocket and I became pre-diabetic. I discovered the **ketogenic diet** and figured, why not? It couldn\'t get any worse.\n\nTen months later I am 50lbs lighter and all of my blood work is within a normal range. I eat bacon and eggs almost every day, fatty steaks, butter, bone broths, liver (yuk!), all these things I was told to eat sparingly. **IMHO, most doctors in America are only in it for the money and are reading from a script, like any other mediocre salesman.** I have a bit of a bias, as my grandfather was an OB/GYN who had grown up in poverty and often worked for free, and would often lament the steep ethical decline the profession had taken over the course of his life.\n\nI have been more or less managing my mental health through general practitioners over the years, telling them what I want. I\'ve kind of hit a wall with this.\n\n\n**This is what I understand about myself:** \n\n* I respond well to drugs that affect **dopamine** and **norepinephrine** levels. Drugs that operate on **serotonin** seem to make me vegetative and unmotivated and give me a false sense of happiness. \n* Too much **norepinephrine** and I will have a manic episode\n* **adderall** feels to me like **speed**, and **ritalin** does not. As I understand it, the difference between the two is that **Ritalin** acts as a **reuptake inhibitor** for these **neurotransmitters**, whereas **Adderall** provides a substitute for them. [[Reference]](http://www.progressivehealth.com/ritalin-adderal.htm)\n* **Adderall** and **Ritalin** both make me edgy, although I seem to get a lot more done on the Ritalin. \n* Cannabis helps me focus, which is atypical of most people, but not atypical of programmers.  I imagine cannabis figured heavily into the creation of reddit.\n* No [Ballmer Peak](http://xkcd.com/323/) for me, however. One sip of alcohol and my brain completely fogs up and I am useless and my ADHD symptoms skyrocket. My worst manic episodes have been under the influence of alcohol, so I try and avoid it altogether. \n\n\nMore recently, I have started **DBT**  and my therapist suggested that internet porn may be rotting my mind. This news kind of bowled me over. I\'m a guy, I get distracted by me needs, and I try and satisfy them as quickly as possible so I can get back to work. The **Adderall** especially tends to increase my sex drive (as did the **Wellbutrin**) and sometimes I would **fap** 3 - 5 times a day. The reading I\'ve done suggests that all that **fapping** combined with the visual stimuli may be affecting **dopamine** levels. I am experimenting with abstaining from porn, but it made me think about how sometimes I would **fap** first thing in the morning if I couldn\'t get out of bed, because it would give me energy. Perhaps it gave me a burst of dopamine that would propel me into the shower, I don\'t know.\n\nI will dig through the archives, but any immediate thoughts on **Modafinil**?\n'"

It seems to reduce the mucus, however, I'd rather something else to stop the mucus in the first place.\n\nI get a tight chest in the summer and I'm itchy in the winter. It's such a pain.\n\nI've read today as well, that people feel tired with allergies. Well, I can't tell you how many times I've been to the GP since I was 18 (35 now) telling them how tired I am only to be sent for bloods.\n\nI have also read today that aches and pains can be part of this. Well, I have been taking codeine for 2.5 years to eliminate and support joint and bone pain which has been a common problem for me since I was young (noone can tell me why). I was told it was growing pains and that it would stop, it didn't.\n\nCould all of this be because of heyfever/dust or some other allergy that has been missed?\n\nI've requested an allergy test as per the pharmacist that I spoke to, so I'll keep you posted. Thought it was interesting to see that perhaps all of these things are tied together. I don't want to get my hopes up but how bloody great would it be if all that stuff disappears, just from the right allergy treatment!!!\n\nAnyone have an experience of this sort of thing? I'd be interested to see how common those symptoms are."""

I will be sharing those methods on reddit soon. ............................................\n\n**Hey guys, I know this is a bit of a long post, but if you suffer from mental illness (especially depression/anxiety/PTSD/insomnia) then it might be worth a read:**\n\nWhen I was very sick (mentally), I knew the day would come when I would feel ""normal"" again. Even though it seemed impossible at the time, I never lost hope. And **I always promised myself that if I was able to dig myself out of that hell hole, I would share my story to hopefully inspire and help others in similar positions.** So here we go.\n\nIt all began when, out of boredom, I decided to travel abroad in the search of ""adventure"". I traveled to my home country (from Canada) and ended up falling in love. I ended up moving to said country, after this person ""proposed"" (he casually asked if I wanted to get married). My family, who lived in Canada in the U.S were horrified, but there was nothing anybody could do to stop me.\n\nThis ""charming bad boy"" who I fell blindly in love with ended up being an emotionally and psychologically abusive (and even physically and sexually abusive), lazy, momma\'s boy (we lived mostly with his mom who did *everything* for him) with a major drinking and drug problem. Many, many things happened in the 4 years I was with him, including physical and sexual abuse, constant emotional abuse/control/jealousy, etc...  I mean, I could write a book about it. I know now that I stayed with him because of my psychological relationship map that was formed from having an emotionally, physically, (and I suspect even sexually) abusive father. **All this resulted in me developing severe cases of clinical depression, anxiety, PTSD and even suicidal tendencies**. On top of that, I had many other instances of sexual abuse (rape) and physical assault happen to me that made my symptoms even worse.\n\n**My PTSD was so bad that I couldn\'t even talk to people, I couldn\'t leave the house, I couldn\'t talk on the phone, or do anything social without having a major panic attack and freezing**. It was literally impossible for me to do anything social without medication (as in, not even once). But after a near death experience (caused by neglect in that relationship), and being dumped by him, I finally ""woke up"" and returned to North America with a new outlook on life. Unfortunately I still had major PTSD and had to take medication to be able to even leave the house, but I had greater expectations for my life this time and would not settle for less.\n\nI unfortunately continued on the habits I picked up while abroad to cope with my issues. These habits included binge drinking on weekends (partying), smoking, and eating almost nothing but junk food to cope with my pain and anxiety. I had to take medication every single time I left the house, I was unable to hold down a job due to my mental issues, I had no social life whatsoever. Every! Single! Morning! upon waking up, I would have a few seconds of bliss before my PTSD symtoms would kick in: racing heart beat that felt like a major heart attack, sweaty palms, shortness of breath, etc. Any loud noise (cars honking, for example) or even someone suddenly talking to me would startle me and sometimes even make me jump. I was constantly on edge and people constantly asked me if I was okay. **It was a complete living hell** \\- which I endured for MANY years, NON-stop.\n\n**The funny thing about mental illness is that after a while of suffering with it, it somehow becomes a part of your identity and you learn to grow comfortable with it. For me, it was very hard to let go of the idea of feeling constantly anxious, and it was hard for me to embrace the idea of having a life without anxiety, PTSD or depression.**\n\nI tried so many things throughout the years to get better; yoga, meditation, exercise (running/lifting weights/pilates), natural herbs and supplements, phenibut, l-theanine,  marihuana, CBD oil, therapy, CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), aromatherapy, acupressure, breathing exercises, self-hypnosis, MANY, many different types of medication (anti-depressants/benzos/anticonvulsant), etc, etc, ETC ... **But nothing seemed to work**, and in fact, some made *it m*uch worse.\n\nI remember one day many years ago, I stumbled upon a[ youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nylajeG6uFY&list=PLD8-7zY_7MknXoph5hHREp5efU9RfcnWr) talking about **EMDR** (e*ye movement desensitization and reprocessing*), made a note on it and then forgot about it (I wish I had taken it more seriously! It would have saved me so many more years of hardship and added trauma). Eventually, I stumbled upon it again a few years later and remembered that I had read about many people claiming it helped them with their PTSD. Unfortunately I did not have the financial means to hire a professional, but I was so desperate that I decided to attempt it on myself... **and I believe that decision saved my life**.\n\nI began researching as much as I could regarding EMDR therapy and started experimenting on my own (which I do not necessarily recommend - more on that later). I remember the first session that I did was about my trauma regarding leaving the house to walk my dog (without medication). Something that I would have never even attempted  in the past. After my EMDR session (it was at night), I went to sleep and kind of forgot about it. The next day I woke up and when I thought about walking my dog, I felt surprisingly comfortable and decided to just go for it (not giving it too much thought). **And wow... how can I even describe what I felt.** I was able to walk my dog all by myself, with absolutely\\* zer*o medication and* zer\\*o anxiety for the first time. It was amazing and surreal. That was the beginning of many more sessions that followed suit in my self-healing journey.\n\nThat being said, I have to add that I have always had an interest in psychology (ironically I have always wanted to become a psychologist - and might still one day), and that even though I had suffered from all these mental issues in the past, I do know how to navigate my mind very well. So, after doing a lot of research on EMDR, I felt confident I could handle it on my own. I say this because **I do not recommend anyone attempting EMDR on their own** (without professional help) if they have no idea how consciousness, subconsciousness, memory, and traumas even work or how the brain works in general, and especially how EMDR work in connection to these.\n\nAfter I started healing myself ""spiritually"" and psychologically, it prompted me to start taking care of my physical body, as well. **I firmly believe that when your mind is not healthy, you neglect your body because there is a disconnect. But once you start feeling healthy on the inside, you re-connect with your body and start taking care of it.**  To continue on with my story - even though my ""spiritual mind"" was healing, I still suffered from insomnia, depression, foggy brain, constipation, and lethargy. I began researching how to heal my body and stumbled upon people talking about ""gut health"". Basically, I found out that your gut (digestive organs) is connected to your mind and it greatly affects your mood, your energy levels, and your overall health in major ways..**.**(you can\\* [*google ""gut mind connection.""*](https://www.google.ca/search?q=gut+mind+connection&oq=gut+mind&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j69i65j0l3.4112j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8))\\* I decided to not only go on a detox to help heal my gut, but try a **raw vegan diet** (I had read and seen the [success storie](https://youtu.be/lgovSvMZMw0?t=2m52s)s online). And guys, that was the last piece of the puzzle; it **completely changed my life**. I began to have more energy than I ever had before, my mind is now crystal clear, I no longer suffer from constipation, my insomnia is gone, my depression is gone, my skin is clearer and is not oily anymore, my hair is shinier and growing fast, my nails are stronger, and the benefits keep on coming with time. I am just a brand new person.\n\nLet me tell you that my story has a very happy ""ending"" (I am only beginning!) I was very fortunate to find a person (my dream guy, actually - no joke!) that saw past my traumas and encouraged and supported me in my self-healing journey. We are now married and have an absolutely gorgeous baby girl together (15 months). **Every morning, I wake up grateful, in serenity, with a smile on my face**; my baby girl smiling, giggling and kissing me, my wonderful husband ready to start the day with new adventures. My life now-a-days consists of them, my rescue dog (I rescued her from the streets while abroad and she was my light during my darkest moments), going on hikes and other outings/walks/adventures, working out, working from home, and much more. But while my self-healing/ self-improvement journey is still not done, I am the happiest I have ever been and I\'m excited about the future.\n\nTo conclude, if you suffer from any sort of mental illness, just know that it is possible to turn your life around 100&#37;. The main thing I have learned about my journey to health, is this: ***You do not know how sick you are until you are healthy.*** Going from a sick body (and mind) that was constantly low on energy, had nightmares, insomnia, foggy mind (poor memory, slow processing, etc), really bad eating habits, constipation, major panic attacks, anxiety, depression, paranoia, major anger issues, etc... to one that is full of energy, healthy, a mind that is clear, happy and at peace... The difference guys... is a whole other world. I know the leap may seem steep, if not impossible when you are feeling like complete garbage. But let me tell you; it\'s not impossib\\*\\*le. Your mind is the most powerful tool you \\*\\*have; and you CAN have the life you dream of. Just keep searching until you find what works for you, and never, ever give up. Hopefully the things that have helped me can help you, as well.\n\nIf you managed to read up until now, thank you. I wish you the very best in your healing journey and if you have any questions at all (I am an open book), please feel free to ask. Or if you would just like someone to talk to, feel free to message me. Also, I have thought about making some online materials to help others (EMDR videos or a website), let me know if this is something that could help you (all resources would be free- I just want to help others heal themselves).\n\n**TL; DR: After a troubled childhood and abusive relationship, I developed major, debilitating PTSD, anxiety and depression that I was able to self-treat through EMDR therapy and going on a Raw Vegan diet. My life has drastically improved for the better and I want to inspire others with my story.**\n\nP.S I just created this reddit account and the first suggested name on the list was ""InevitableDiamond,"" I just thought it was very fitting for how I feel and what my story is about. :)\n\nP.P.S I apologize for any grammar/spelling issues, I have already spent about 4 hours trying to write this post and won\'t have time to edit until later!'"

Advil problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/m5slfj/daily_headache_for_months_please_help/,b'Daily headache for months. Please help!',,"b""31 year old Male here.\n\n* Chronic headaches first appeared about 5 months ago as a mild pulsating pain in my forehead that would throb for a few seconds every 30 seconds or so. Then they appeared every afternoon. Then they were there when I woke up every morning. \n\n* Eventually I went to my doctor who thought it was due to my high BP (145/90 on average), so he **precribed me Amlodipine**, a low dose at 2.5mg every night before bed. That very first morning after taking it, I woke up headache free. \n* For the next few weeks I continued to be headache free, so was convinced it was my BP. I worked on lowering it through diet and exercise, but then the headaches came back - regardless of how high/low my BP was. There seemed to be no correlation. My BP is now consistently healthy. \n* A couple months into them returning, the headaches would continue to mainly appear in my forehead, usually the right side. It was never as painful as a migraine (which I had a lot of as a small child). It was just very annoying and sometime it felt like something was crawling around my forehead under my skin. A couple Advil liquid gels would get rid of it for the entire day 90% of the time. A couple days a month the pain would be so minimal that I didn't take any meds.\n* Around February the headaches stopped appearing in my forehead and only appeared in what felt like the center of my head and areas in back. Sometimes a sharp pain would appear on either side of my temples. My doctor said I could try increasing my dose of Amplodipine to 5mg each night. Shortly after, the headaches were less severe and I even went a few days without feeling the need to take Advil for them.\n* But then they returned even worse. Despite healthy eating, 30 minutes of cardio each day, and lots of hydration, I'm still suffering.\n* **My MRI, sleep study, and eye exam came back normal**.\n* It's worth noting that my headaches appeared about the same time my breathing problems did caused by GERD, and I continue to take Omeprazole every morning for that along with my Advil/Tylenol.\n* At this point, Advil and Tylenol/Excedrin are no longer getting rid of it for most of the day like they once were - which has me very concerned.\n* Headaches seem to run in my family. My dad used to get them almost daily and now takes 10mg of Amlodipine which has reduced them to around 5 times a month. My sister says she has to sleep on her side or else she'll wake up with them, and both her and my mom get ocular migraines.\n* I'm thinking it could be a kind of cervicogenic headache due to my bad posture and sitting at a computer most of the day, and being a side sleeper, but I don't have some of the other symptoms such as neck and shoulder pain. I'm going to start doing neck/posture exercises to see if that helps.\n\nI AM DESPERATE FOR ADVICE OR SOLUTIONS!!! I will honestly Venmo someone money if they provide me with a treatment that ends up being effective. Even more for a cure!"""
Advil eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/x67cjo/sleep_and_death_anxiety/,b'Sleep and Death Anxiety',,"b""Hey everyone I'm new to this community and wanted to share my thoughts on something I've been going through: \n\nI have dealt with death anxiety to a crippling extent on and off for several years, starting in my mid teens for a few years, then rearing it's ugly head again when I'd all but forgotten the crippling experience, within weeks of me giving birth to my beautiful second child, a boy. Both times it reared its ugly head just as I was closing my eyes for an evening of rest. \n\nSo here's what I think is going on, I fight the urge to sleep, heavily. Why? Idk. With my death fear and anxiety comes depression, a lack of hunger, a lack of desire to just exist in the day, at its height I'd spend all day waiting to sleep, or wanting to sleep because I didn't want to feel these feelings anymore. But when the night came with each phase of exhaustion that washed over me I just couldn't close my eyes, I needed help, so I would take a sleeping aid like Midol PM or Advil PM or Benadryl after watching TikTok or TV mindlessly for usually hours to dissociate. \n\nI'm only recently becoming aware of this correlation but it's a definitive theme for me. Well no sooner did this issue dawn on me then an article shows up on my feed connecting disrupted circadian rhythms to mental illness. \n\nSo how did I becoke aware of this in myself? Well I started looking into Buddhism and other eastern teachings, my thought process was Christianity isn't helping me right now and materialism and scientific reductionsim isn't either or my SSRIs would be working. \n\nMy thought was this: Every night I drift off to sleep and sometimes I dream and sometimes I don't but I always wake up the next morning. If there's nothing after this life then that's okay, because sleep is nice and peaceful. It's hard to fully accept that as a young person but life helps us all towards the end to see this. Death is not the opposite of life but the opposite of birth. But then I stopped- \n\nIf I really feel that way about death, why do I fight so hard with sleep? Knowing full well I will in fact wake up the next day? How can I accept death when I can't even accept sleep?\n\nWell that I can't answer. I don't know what came first, my mental illness? My sleep issue? Who can say? I like sleep, as a young mother, I need it, I don't have nightmares often, a few series of them as a very young child, but overall I've had lots of good dreams too. \n\nSo I ask you all, have you noticed a similar correlation in your life on your own mental health journey? How correlated do you think these two things are? \n\nI'm going to try to accept sleep more often, and I hope that helps me in accepting other things that are natural and healthy like dying. If you have any tips on overcoming my resistance to rest without drugs let me know! \n\nhttps://neurosciencenews.com/circadian-rhythm-mental-health-21347/"""

acetaminophen swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/10fw2oq/homeopathic_post_oralsurgery_treatments/,b'Homeopathic post oral-surgery treatments',,"b'I had a gum graft and wisdom tooth extraction today. The periodontist who did my procedure has so far only presented themselves as an excellent and genuinely caring professional with the best of intentions. They are very well-known in my area and have been practicing for decades, with glowing online reviews, and both my dentist and orthodontist independently recommended them as being the best. The procedure went extremely smoothly and I am so far not in much pain. The one thing I was very disappointed with is that I was given some homeopathic post-surgery care, the StellaLife oral post-surgery care kit and arnica pills for reducing swelling/pain. The periodontist does also have me on conventional medical protocols for the procedure such as antibiotics and a chlorhexidine gluconate rinse, and they did still recommend conventional painkillers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, yet I can\'t help but feel insulted and confused that I was also directed to use homeopathic products that have little evidence as to safety and efficacy. I am inclined to just do what my provider tells me, since it seems to have ""worked"" for their patients all this time. I am trying to just assure myself that at worst these treatments will do nothing, since homeopathic products are generally too diluted to have any positive or negative effect anyways. But I have to wonder, are these sorts of homeopathic/pseudoscientific treatments commonly prescribed by dental professionals? Is this something I should be concerned about?'"
codeine problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/hjzlvf/my_5_months_journey_with_sciatica_and_how_i_got/,b'My 5 months journey with sciatica and how I got better',,"b'*Disclaimer*: this post covers a sciatica caused by herniated disk in the lumbar region. This is the most frequent cause of sciatica. All my observations may not apply to sciaticas caused by other factors. Also I am not a doctor.\n\n# Who am I?\n\nI am a 45 years old male and I got sciatica after lifting at the gym. My core strength was insufficient for my squat weight and depth and I got an hernia that pinched my nerve in January of this year. On the weeks after, I had 10/10 pain for several hours a day (in the morning) and this laster for weeks and even months. Its now July of 2020, and 5 months later I am getting much better.\n\nMy nerve is still sensitive and I have to be very cautious of my posture and my movements. But I mainly live a normal life. I can\'t jog or do most sports, but I can walk, workout (with caution), do gardening, seat, drive and do most casual things painlessly.\n\nHere are my takeaways:\n\n# I changed my lifestyle\n\nI almost never sat for months because I did not want to bend my back and cause pain. Sometimes I would not even seat for meals and I ate while standing. I also would limit getting in and out of bed to the bare minimum. I purchased portable urinals from Amazon so that I did not have to get up at night to pee. Life changing!\n\nFor me the best position was on my stomach on the bed. I lied across the bed, my feet and head hanging. I\'d put bellow under my chest or my belly, depending on the pain. I\'d have an iPad laying on the floor for entertainment.\n\nI mainly slept on the back without pillow. Some other mentioned sleeping on the floor, it did not help for me.\n\nSo do not try to continue living the same lifestyle that enabled sciatica in the first place. You\'re lifting? Stop. You\'re sitting all day? Stand up or lie down on your stomach. Youre bending your back all day? Stop and learn about spine hygiene (search for the book Back mechanic). Try to continue living your life as is? The pain will continue or worsen.\n\n# My sciatica fixed itself but it took time\n\nIn my case I did nothing but rest, stand, walk and lie down. I almost never sat, never did any specific workouts or stretches.\n\nLets say you broke your arm. Do you do stretches? Do you workout your core? Do you take painkillers? Nope. You just immobilize your arm and let nature do the work.\n\nThe same goes for sciatica. You can take painkillers at the beginning when its very tough but dont get used to it and stop as soon as possible. They will not cure you. They will instead become addictive and allow bad movements.\n\nYou basically need to rest and perform the least amount of movements that induce pain. For as long as necessary. Be very wary of miracle stretches or exercises that you find on Youtube. Would you do the same for a broken arm?\n\n# I got emotional support\n\nSciatica comes with sometimes unbearable pain. This takes a toll on your mental health. You need to have moral support and people to talk to. Could be friends, family, counselor or all of the above. Do not keep it to yourself. Being in pain and being alone is very tough.\n\nI had a lot of pain in the mornings. Usually I had to walk 1 or 2 hours before the pain would ease up. I took the habit of calling a friend or a colleague at that time just to have my brain focus on something else. Also it was during quarantine, so I kept doing the sessions with my shrink but we did them over the phone and talked about pain exclusively. Pain is so tough on you. It seems so unfair! So you need to talk this through.\n\n# I changed things and had to be patient\n\nI was very lucky to be able to work from home, and standing. I put my laptop on the kitchen counter and worked standing like this for months. Also I could take time off often. Because the pain is so tough, sometimes you can really find any interest in anything. So be gentle with yourself.\n\nSciatica is a serious injury. Do not try to push trough it. Stop what you are doing. Stop going to work if it makes you seat all day or do manual labor thats painful. Yes it might take months. Yes you might loose money. Yes people could resent you. Yes you might loose your gains at the gym. But if treated well, your sciatica will be fixed in months... sometimes faster! Ignore the pain? It could take years. Or you might have to get surgery.\n\nRegarding your job. It\'s tough to say and also tough to read, I guess, but if you must loose your job, just accept it because for instance, you just can\'t continue to carry heavy stuff with sciatica. Or it will last years and years. Same for plumbers or masons. If you guys have severe sciatica, you will probably have to change job. Or at least stop until it gets better. That\'s very unfair and very bad, but do you want to suffer endlessly and get addicted to opioids? Your life is more important than your job. You might loose a lot but living in pain is worst.\n\n# Pills were mainly useless\n\nI took AINS (diclofenac mainly) and light opioids (codeine mainly). Those are mostly useless. I guess people tend to think they work. Hell, maybe for some people, they do. Me, I took them as mental aids mainly. I told myself that if I took them, Id be OK. After 2 months of taking them I knew it was a bad thing a wanted to stop. It was hard. I tried it several times but could not do it.\n\nSo, one time I just quit cold turkey and was in pain for a week. But then the pain eased up and painkillers where no longer necessary.\n\nAgain, if you are not provoking pain by ignoring or masking it with painkillers, it will get bearable and slowly disappear.\n\nRegarding walking: its good but do not over do it, especially at the beginning. The consensus is that its bad to stay in bed and do nothing. So most doctors recommend to do some walking. I kind of agree but be very careful and do not provoke too much pain.\n\nRegarding medication and pain, I highly recommend this article that was very enlightening to me: [https://www.ismoc.net/nopillsnopain.html](https://www.ismoc.net/nopillsnopain.html)\n\n# I did not get surgery\n\nSome people need surgery. If you have the worst forms of sciatica and cant pee or take a dump or if your leg goes numb or if the pain is just constant and horrible then its a solution.\n\nBut most sciatica are not like this. The pain is very tough but thats it.\n\nThe scientific literature is pretty clear on this point. Avoid surgery if you humanly can. After a few weeks, the outcome is the same wether you had surgery or only rest. So rest and be patient and do not succumb to the idea of getting your back butchered.\n\nAs for myself, when the pain made me cry, I would have asked people to stab me in the back even if there was a 1% chance that it would have worked! But pain is an horrible adviser. Surgery works but makes your back more fragile. You might very well need more surgeries down the line. Look it up.\n\nDo not cause pain, rest and dont get surgery if you can.\n\n# Doctors are mainly ignorant of the nature and the pain caused by sciatica\n\nIt\'s very important that you get an MRI. Most sciatica are caused by a bulging or herniated disc. But not all. Also it\'s useful to know it looks like in your spine. That\'s basically the most useful thing doctors can do for you: prescribe an MRI.\n\nLet\'s face it, most doctors don\'t know a lot about sciatica. Most will prescribe painkillers and that\'s about it. To make it simple: most health professionals will provide exactly what they\'re known for. GP\'s will provide drugs. Chiropractors will provide manipulations (which are dangerous, you should NOT go and see a chiropractor with a sciatica). PT\'s will provide you with some massage but mostly core strengthening exercices. Surgeons will push you toward surgery.\n\nThat\'s the issue with sciatica. There\'s no holistic approach. You will get contradicting advice and treatment. For me, the best sources for a correct treatment are McKenzie (ex: [http://sqhillchiropractic.com/images/McK-1-05-1.pdf](http://sqhillchiropractic.com/images/McK-1-05-1.pdf)) and McGill (search for the book Back Mechanic). I find McKenzie more inline with my philosophy because he doesn\'t prescribe workouts. Just light stretches and posture corrections. Which I think is more inline with my ""rest first"" philosophy.\n\nTo summarize my treatment, it was basically the following:\n\n* rest on my belly\n* do a lot of walking / standing\n* do almost no seating\n* no back bending or bad back hygiene\n* no workouts, stretches\n\n# My pain often changed in nature and severity\n\nMy pain was always changing. The feel of it. Sometimes it would feel pointy and stingy, sometimes more deep and scary. But also the location. Sometime my calf would hurt, sometimes my butt cheek. Could be my foot, could be my thigh.\n\nIt was difficult to understand. Why I am in a lot of pain now and yesterday was better? Well I don\'t have any answers but my guess is that it\'s normal. Also the weather plays a big role. A cold and rainy weather will make my pain worse.\n\nAlso I walked a lot and probably too much. My hernia-induced sciatica morphed into a piriformis syndrome. The piriformis muscle is a flat, band-like muscle located in the buttocks near the top of the hip joint. When your sciatic nerve is irritated it can make that muscle painful. So because of this issue, my pain changed, increased and lasted longer. When I cut walking time, it very quickly got much better.\n\nI walked up to 15km / days. I had to cut to 3-5 km a day at most and my sciatica got much better.\n\n# When it got better I did physical therapy\n\nI did visit the PT after the quarantine was over. My pain was more manageable at the time. My PT is very good (I still visit him every week) because he took things slowly. Did massages first and treated my piriformis muscle by extending it mainly to relax it. After this we started some exercise, mainly to improve muscle strength and mobility of the core. Now it\'s getting tougher and we are doing almost traditional workouts with core exercises mainly.\n\nI don\'t know if I would recommend doing PT sessions on the first weeks when the pain is debilitating. Especially if your PT is not used to sciatica. Maybe some redditors can comment on this issue.\n\n# My conclusion\n\nThe scientific literature seem to agree with my own experience. Rest and the change of bad habits, posture and movements seem to be the best treatment. I understand that it might seem like a better solution to ignore the pain with meds and then get a surgery because it allows you to go on with your life as is. However longtime treatments with painkillers are not a good thing whatsoever and back surgery is a serious intervention that can lead to complications and might necessitate new surgeries down the line.\n\nThis is quite difficult to picture in our world that a health problem might only require patience. However if you look like things like even a cold or a flu, most drugs do not really accelerate the healing. The merely dampen the symptoms. And even that is maybe not good, as some people think that inflammation is a useful function of the body that actually contributes to healing. Same goes for sciatica in this case because it\'s caused by inflammation.\n\nSciatica is very hard, that\'s the thing. But most people are healed after a few weeks / months. So get emotional support and be patient. I got healed as many of us on this sub have. You got this.'"

It is intensely sharp whenever I laugh, cry, or speak in anything above a normal voice. It is also painful when I swallow, although to a lesser degree, especially if I turn my head to the right. Sometimes the pain stretches into my left ear, sometimes not. It subsides for a swallow or two if I clear my throat first or stick out my tongue as far as I can.\n\nI imagine this sounds weird, but its been going on since the end of September, getting slowly but steadily worse, so Ive tried all kinds of stuff to get the pain to lessen. \n\nI have seen my EENT twice about it, but he has focused on lymph tissue and my tonsils. The two visits have turned up swollen lymph tissue around the tonsils, which antiseptic mouthwash cleared up, as well as swollen lymph nodes on the left side of my neck, for which he prescribed a weeks worth of penicillin. \nNeither of these treatments helped with the pain. \n\nIt is starting to move beyond an annoyance to something intense enough to move me to tears, which unfortunately makes it hurt much worse.

Sure enough, in the lymph tissue behind my left tonsil, theres a little nodule, almost like a zit or a blister. Thats the culprit.  \n\nCould it be a cyst?

For context, I am a cis female in her 20s. Be warned, this post is going to be long so apologies in advance. `Also, I am going to be linking images here, some of which a gross/graphic. Please click at your own discretion!`\n\nAround January 9th my vagina started hurting. I was concerned because it had no explanation. Im not sexually active, wasnt near my period, and hadnt had any trauma/penetration. I looked it up and concluded I either had a yeast infection or vaginitis. Even though it was my first infection and it was more so "" self-diagnosed"" I didnt want to go to doctor because of Omicron. So I bought Monistat 3 instead. It hurt like hell - especially on the first night - but the pain and symptoms subsided.\n\nHowever, I then quickly developed symptoms common in UTIs (burning during urination, frequent need/urge to urinate, sudden need/urge to urinate to point of urinary incontinence , little urine coming out, sometimes blood in urine that does come out, etc). To confirm that I had a UTI, I bought a CVS at home UTI strip test and as soon as I peed on it, it turned bright purple on the top pad, indicating the presence of leukocytes ([picture of UTI strip test 1](https://imgur.com/a/GdnIw41)).\n\nI went on [goodrx.com](https://goodrx.com), to get a prescription and told them my symptoms.

They were alarmed and wouldn\'t give me a prescription because the were worried I had a kidney infection. She told me to go to an ER or urgent care immediately or as soon as possible (it was like 2am, my symptoms were keeping me awake)\n\nSo, a few hours later, on the 13th, I went to an (poorly reviewed, but mostly empty and not overrun with COVID) urgent care and told them my symptoms and about my positive strip test. I also told them that I had recently vomited, was experiencing nausea, and had lower back pain. They gave me a 100mg prescription for Macrobid and *then* took a urine sample. I was on the Macrobid for 5 days. Some of my symptoms alleviated (blood in urine & less serve burning) but I was still uncomfortable. I took another UTI strip test and I was positive for leukocytes again ([picture of UTI strip test 2](https://imgur.com/a/3DPJhPG)). Worried that the antibiotics hadn\'t worked, I took my temperate. My thermometer is not great, but it gives the temperature and a happy face :), medium face :/, or sad face :(. My temperature got a :/ and was (according to the cheap thermometer) 99.8 ([picture thermometer reading](https://imgur.com/a/ZO6dGIq)). While I assumed at the time that it was just anxiety, I was also feeling rather nauseous at this time and have some gastrointestinal issues.\n\nI went back to the same urgent care (only place with open appointments in my area) on the 19th. This time, they didnt automatically give me a prescription and took a urine sample *first*. I told them about my thermometer\'s reading (low-grade fever?) and they took my temperate, which was normal. They told me my sample had ""no leukocytes and no nitrates"". They said I should see a OBGYN or Urologist if my symptoms continued. Unsatisfied, I asked the urgent care to do a urine culture and they agreed. In the meantime they gave me a 3-day 200mg prescription of Phenazopyridine to ""improve symptoms"".\n\nHowever, when I got emailed the results for my urine culture a few days later, it said I had a ""beta demo streptococcus, group b"" colony of I believe 10,000-25,000 growing inside me. The urine culture recommended that I take ""Penicillin or Ampicillin"" to get rid of the colony. The urgent care however, didnt contact me or provide a new prescription for this drug.\n\nOn the 22nd, I went to a different urgent care. I told them my continued symptoms and showed them the lab results from the urine culture. They took a urine sample and said I definitely have a UTI (meaning the poorly review urgent care was wrong). They also said I had a lot of glucose in my urine (I think it was 250 mg dL?). They were concerned that I might have diabetes (I guess. I am 5 3 and about 100lbs) so they took a blood sample and it was normal (110 - also I wasn\'t fasting). This, to them, ruled out diabetes. From my understanding however, having glucose in your urine is still quite bad and indicative of the kidney being damaged or diseased ([renal glycosuria](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/renal-glycosuria/))? For context, as a baby, I was hospitalized for a week with a severe kidney infection and my kidney is scarred. Additionally, my mother (biological) has an auto-immune kidney disease. I unfortunately, didn\'t tell this to the people at urgent care, but I don\'t know if it would have been important.\n\nAnyways, they gave me a 7-day prescription for 300mg of Cefdinir. A few days later, I got my 2nd urine culture results back and they said I ""didnt have much growth"". They said this was likely due to the antibiotic I had already taken, but to keep taking the new antibiotic.\n\nI finished the prescription yesterday (29th) but while taking it, my initial symptom of vaginal pain/tenderness re-appeared. First, it was just during wiping but by the time I was almost out of the antibiotics, it kept me up a lot of the night and was hurting without being touched/wiped.  Furthermore, despite (or because of, in some cases) my drinking water and having the antibiotic, my urge to urinate was (and is) still more often than usual and my urine is (and was) cloudy and foul/sour smelling.\n\nThis morning (30th), I took my 1 remained CVS UTI strip test and it was positive for leukocytes (there was also slight dot of positivity for nitrates?) ([picture of UTI strip test 3](https://imgur.com/a/1ZHqoWs)). Upon looking to the reviews for this product however, I saw it does tend to have false positive results ([1](https://www.cvs.com/shop/cvs-health-urinary-tract-infection-test-strips-prodid-870916)). So, I went out to buy AZO UTI strip test, which has better rating. ([2](https://www.amazon.com/AZO-Infection-Accurate-Clinically-Self-Testing/dp/B00854L57U)). It was once again positive for leukocytes ([picture of UTI strip test 4](https://imgur.com/a/RAMUcvY)).\n\nAt the time I bought the AZO UTI Test Strips, I also bought *AZO Complete Feminine Balance daily probiotic* because of the vaginal pain/itching I have been experiencing. I know one on the side effects of antibiotics is yeast infections, so thats what I thought it was.\n\nNow, to get to the poop stuff, all the while (and prior to this all beginning) I have had minor gastrointestinal issues (mucus in stool, etc). During this time in late January, I also cycled through my period, so I initially blamed it on the period poops. But I finished my period a few days ago. Anyways, I went back to the bathroom and felt a need to go number 2 but nothing was coming out besides smelly, noisy farts and mucus/a clear goopy liquid). Then, a tiny piece of poop came out, and seemed to have two string-like things in it. One was darker and thicker, and the other was smaller and whiteish `WARNING: GRAPHIC!` ([poop with somethings possibly in it?](https://imgur.com/a/ZlVamWf)) `WARNING: GRAPHIC!`\n\nI found this alarming and look it up. I thought/hoped maybe it was a single fiber string (if anything) but then I saw according to some, ([sydneygutclinic.com](http://sydneygutclinic.com/)) recurrent yeast infections can be a symptom linked to parasites ([3](https://sydneygutclinic.com/the-main-symptoms-of-parasitic-infection/))? I don\'t really know, but now I am worried. As I was writing this, I had the urge to go the the bathroom *again* and while I didnt find anything stringy in my poop and was able to pass some stools, there were also lots of flecks of poop, as well as some possible mucus. Also, the poop/farts are sometimes very pungently smelling like baby poop `WARNING: GRAPHIC!` ([more poo](https://imgur.com/a/ApV1wws)) `WARNING: GRAPHIC!`\n\nI also read on a website ([healthline.com](http://healthline.com/)) that their can be an overgrowth of Candida bacteria in the intestines, as well as the vagina ([4](https://www.healthline.com/health/candida-in-stool)). Maybe it isnt a worm and the yeast infection spread from my vagina to my intestines? But those part of the body arent even connected. Im very confused.\n\n**I am going to establish care with a gynecologist and primary care professional** but I am a little freaked out, cause some sites ([lymedisease.org](http://lymedisease.org/)) say it might be Lyme disease ([5](https://www.lymedisease.org/parasites-viruses-yeast-fungal-infections/))? I obviously, will take everything I read on the internet (including here) with a grain of salt, but I am worried.\n\nI would really appreciate some advice. I don\'t have a OBGYN, Primary Care Provider, or a Urologist, so when I make an appointment/establish care, do I tell them it\'s urgent?  If so, how urgent?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\\*throughout this ordeal, I have tested* ***negative*** *for COVID-19 multiple times*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------\n\nEdit/Update: I went to the bathroom yet again, and in addition to there being another thicker, string, substance - that substance seemed to kinda move? The string or whatever it is, moved from the top of the poop to the bottom. I wasn\'t able to get a gif/video of it moving and perhaps it was the air/farts coming out of me? But I wasn\'t sitting on the toilet when I took the picture? Regardless, here is the picture of how it looked before it started moving `WARNING: GRAPHIC!` ([poop with spiral coming out of it](https://imgur.com/a/djxk4uM)) `WARNING: GRAPHIC!`\n\nIn addition to that, I also saw what looked like could have been blood?

I was hoping to give a quick history of my symptoms for the past six months and hear some of your feedback and/or questions. \n\nIve been dealing with sciatica for the past 6 months, possibly caused by lifting a heavy desk.\n\nThe first month I didnt really know what was happening and hoped it would pass. \n\nIt got worse so I went to my doctor after a few months and he said likely lower back mechanical issues, said he thought it was not disc issue, and sent me to physio.\n\nPhysio said he thought it was a disc issue and set me up with core strength, side plank, bird dog type exercises. I did them religiously and he increased their difficulty for 2 months but things were getting slowly worse week by week.\n\nI did tell my physio 2-3 months back that its weird my left leg feels longer than my right but he didnt think much of it. \n\nThere have been days where the pain is less, but generally I feel pain in down my left side only. In my buttocks 24/7, up into my lower back I feel it most of the time, and then down my hamstring, back of my calf, sometimes around the front of my lower ankle as well, both heels get numbness (probably more of a pins and needles feeling since Im not physically losing sensation) and my toes as well, mostly left big toe but sometimes the other 4 on that foot too.\n\nI was not seeing progress with physio and did read back mechanic a few times and my pain is mostly all flexion related.\n\nGetting my left shoe on is very painful and challenging. \n\nI did the big 3 in addition to my physio for a few days but I actually seem to be getting worse and really stopped all my exercises at that point because I was feeling near constant pain since then. Ive been just resting and icing and light walking for probably 45 days now with zero progress. \n\nSince it was not getting better I went back to doctor for imaging request plus new issue I noticed, alignment is bad in my back. \n\n[Two images of my poor alignment.](https://imgur.com/a/NoKSuNu)\n\nMy doctor felt my SI joint from behind (didnt even need to look at me with shirt off like these pictures) and told me he is certain it is a problem with my SI joint.\n\nWhats interesting is now that he has told me this the pain that I was certain was in my piriformis area really does seem to be directly on that SI joint.\n\n **next steps**\nMy doctor said he is very confident. Its not a disc issue now and also that a CT scan or MRI would had no value. \n\nHe suggested seeing a chiropractor. Personally, Im not a fan of chiropractors and Ive never been to one due to some bias instilled in me throughout my life. I told him as much and he suggested he almost never suggests chiropractor either except with SI joint issues.\n\nIm still waiting for the hospital to get back to me about scheduling a CT scan but I do have a MRI scheduled for next week, so Im hoping that provides some information one way or another. \n\nThe pain is pretty bad most mornings, mellows out during the day, and by evening its bad again. My doctor has offered medication, but so far Im only taking Advil, ibuprofen, and more recently some muscle relaxers in the form of Robax usually in the evening an hour or so before bed.\n\nWhat do you guys think about these images, the diagnosis thus far, thoughts on medication or not, injection for both pain relief or SI diagnosis (my doctor is always 100% sure hes right just by looking, but Id prefer a confirmed diagnosis and saw a surgeon speaking on YouTube about the injection method) and what would your next steps be?\n\nThank you!!'"

Been using that daily ever since, and Id say my acne has improved but just wont let up completely.\n\nYesterday, I had my follow up with the dermatologist. Also said that my oiliness and breakouts are starting to get bad again since the warmer weather has kicked in. So, I was told I can stop using WL, but continue with tret. And with that, theyve put me on Spiro. I was advised to take 25mg daily for the first 2-3 weeks, then can take 50mg daily from there on out. \n\nI was told the side effects would likely be very minimal, the derm said it will be important to stay hydrated since it can dry out my lips/mouth/face since its ultimately meant to combat the oiliness. But Ive heard it can cause dizziness since it also acts as a high blood pressure medication (though my BP is usually elevated bc I have an anxiety disorder, so maybe this will work in my favor lol). Then, I saw how it can affect periods, cause vein damage, heart problems, can mess with your bodys vitamins and in rare cases, lead to GI bleeding and depression. This is the first oral prescription medication Ive ever been prescribed aside from birth control and I just want to ensure the side effects wont be a problem (anxiety disorder showing? Haha).

Hope this helps those who are at the end of their rope like I once was.'",,"b'TL;DR Wide variety of treatments, severe depression, lifelong sinus problems.\n\n*disclaimer* Long time lurker, first time posting. Throwaway account for a few personal reasons. While I recognize different treatments work for different people, I believe that I found a fundamental cause of a very common, stubborn, and chronic form of acne, comedones, and inflammation. This is my story of discovery.\n\nTwenty-four year old male having suffered from mild, to moderate, to severe acne on my face over ten years and have never had a clear complexion in all that time until now. I have a fair complexion, sensitive skin, and moderate food/airborne seasonal allergies. Years ago my initial breakouts began in the ""T-zone"" specifically blackheads on and surrounding my nose. The war-zone then expanded to whiteheads and blackheads on my brow, and a malicious mix of cystic acne and whiteheads on my cheeks and jawline. I also broke out behind my ears with large milia-like, hard, non-inflammatory nodules. I am a clean and hygienic person and use fresh towels, one for face only one for body, I wash my sheets and pillow-cases regularly, and do my best to avoid touching my face throughout the day. I was always baffled by my recurring problem and assumed others were misjudging my condition as a biproduct of sloth and uncleanliness. \n\nYears of dermatologist appointments racked up costly bills as well as exposure to extremely powerful medications that I naively took in good faith from a doctor. In truth, my dermatologist was a Rx pusher and his friendly demeanor his effective sales-tool of deception. After having poor results (red flaky skin) with Rx topicals such as benzoyl peroxide, differin, duac and clindamycin, I was routed toward using Rx pills such as Minocycline, Doxycycline, and Tetracycline in conjunction with the topicals. Every time I changed antibiotics my skin improved for a few weeks before rapidly deteriorating into scar-inducing cystic breakouts. \n\nIn 2004 at my dermatologist\'s recommendation went on my first regimen of Accutane. I read the labels and warnings but was assured only a small percentage of patients ever experience these side-effects and that the drug was ""pretty much"" guaranteed to work. That half-hearted promise combined with the fact that every other treatment had failed led me to believe Accutane was to be my salvation. I\'ve known people who truly benefitted from the drug but I want to share how it effected me. Within a few weeks my skin became dry and red, my scalp itchy, my joints ached, my eyes jaundiced and I experienced irregular sleep patterns as well as periods of manic depression. Did I tell anyone? No. Why? I was going to tough it out to FINALLY defeat my acne and the anxiety that came with it. I had regular blood work and was told everything checked out, that my side effects were normal. Anyway, after 5 months of soul-draining exposure to the drug, my skin was worse than before the treatment. The acne coverage was about the same, but my skin was thin and weak, hypersensitive, red, blotchy, and constantly dry.\n\n I went back to my usual regimen of a gentle wash and wallowed in self pity for over a year, never really improving, having ""o.k. days"" and ""terrible weeks"" before my dermatologist recommended a fourth course of antibiotics to prevent further scarring. They failed again. After that I entered my picking phase, where on some primal level I was determined to kill the condition myself if the medications couldnt. The subsequent scarring and lack of progress is still regrettable to this day. So I found myself sitting, slouched and defeated flipping through random magazines in the dermatologist\'s waiting rooms listening to the pages flip-over without reading a word, feeling broken. At that point I would have dunked my face in an acid bath and hid in a cave for a year if I could emerge blemish free but instead was misguided to a regimen far worse. A second round of Accutane. \n\nThis time the dermatologist had concrete numbers for me, 80% success rate for second course users he said. Four months later I found myself standing on a second story balcony with a belt around my neck thinking about how my skin was still going to look pock-marked inflamed, and mangled during an open casket ceremony. I\'m not a religious person, so instead of thanking God, I thank the cheap manufacturing process that caused the belt to snap at the buckle on the way down. It is also important to say that this was undoubtedly the most selfish thing I have ever done. I hit the ground and kneed myself in the jaw. Spitting blood I thought of all the people I would have heart and all the painful questions they\'d be asking, likely to arrive at the wrong conclusion. A few months before I was a witty, engaged and humorous person, aware of my physical eyesores, upset by them, but not self-loathing by any means. Granted on my first course of Accutane I\'d have moments where I felt really down but the magnitude of depression and the destructive, neurotic introspection I experienced during my second course led me to live a quiet secluded life of hermitage and hopelessness. \n\nI haven\'t told anyone I know about this struggle and the severity of my own actions and I thank this forum and its members for giving me the courage to discuss it and I implore others to seek out someone to talk to if they find themselves as wayward as I was. Also, be mindful of your peers and reach out to help others if you notice a change in someone\'s demeanor and habits, which may not be so sudden or apparent. I was really good at lying about how ""okay"" I was just to get people to stop asking questions and leave me alone. It\'s not an easy thing to trust someone with a personal strife and sometimes making the first contact can save a life. \n\nThe battle continues...\n\nAfter picking myself up off the ground, both metaphorically and literally, I decided I was done with prescription medications and stopped taking Accutane immediately. I then began a passionate pursuit of vitamins, minerals, and natural health supplements. I was convinced the problem was internal (where else could this pus, inflammation, and gunk be coming from) and also realized if my wounds and scars were going to heal efficiently I needed to create the ideal nutrient climate in my system. I started with a high protein, high-fiber, high anti-inflammatory/alkaline diet combined with tons of water (with lemon juice) and exercise and gradually moved towards supplementing with additional items. I also recognized that I broke out worse after taking long hot showers or eating certain foods the days before, specifically high-yeast and high-sugar content foods/beverage and cheeses. \n\nI started experimenting, altering every fews months to allow for effective courses with various regimens including Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc, Copper, Vitamin D, Potassium, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, Selenium, DMAE, Cod-Liver Oil, Probiotics, Biotin, and other B-Complexes. I want to note that it is very very important to hydrate diligently and refrain from excessive use of alcohol when taking a hefty supplement load as it can strain your liver and kidneys. I know in college it is difficult to refrain from alcohol altogether so drink A LOT of water throughout the day. Be sure to take the vitamins and supplements at the appropriate time of day and with water or with food as directed. Throwing down a heap of all of them at once is not advised as they react with each other. The result, my skin improved, my energy levels rose and my wounds healed more quickly but I was still experiencing breakouts, though less severe, and rarely anymore forthcoming cystic acne (some deep knots still slumbered under layers of tissue.) I also still had occasional flare-ups and they were almost always isolated to my cheeks, nose, brow, and behind my ears. \n\nI maintained that strategy for a few years but still would wake up every morning to at least one or two new whiteheads and a scattering of blackheads on my nose and brow, and incurred a few scars here and there that deceptively add up over time. Where was this gunk coming from? I knew that I was still missing something and my obsession with ""solving"" the problem led to unwarranted picking again of tiny comedones and milia which sometimes became inflamed and larger because of my prying. I also tried natural topicals such as tea tree oil, manuka oil,manuka honey, lavender oil, baking soda, castor packs and ice baths and though wound healing and recovery time was expedited, the underlying cause was still at work. \n\nThen in a collision of coincidences I made my discovery. It was a combination of reviewing a copy of my medical records which noted several ear infections as a child. While I was sick with a sinus infection I studied the anatomy of sinus passages and discovered chronic sinusitis is actually a yeast infection/candida overgrowth. This can be worsened by long term effects of exposure to antibiotics. Drumroll please....the literal and figurative underlying cause to my chronic acne was my sinuses!\n\nI realized when looking at a diagram of sinus passages that the most prevalent breakout regions on my face were directly above/surrounding my sinuses. My cheeks, nose, brow, temples, behind my ears/neck. I found myself excitedly asking, could I have developed a resistant infection (possibly gram negative/yeast combo + allergy aggravated) in my sinuses that stubbornly resided at varying capacities depending on the strength of my immune system (i.e. flare ups during flu-season / better skin in summer when swimming in/accidentally inhaling ocean salt water) Was this my eureka moment?\n\nI immediately went to the store and bought a ""Neil Med"" sinus rinse set (there are other kinds but this one gives you the ability to slightly pressurize the flow of the solution) which included the non-iodized salt and baking soda packets. Using filtered water I started the process. Much to my dismay I expelled heaps of dark green and brown sludge from deep within my sinus cavities over the next two days. Followed by three days of yellow goo. Followed by a mixed clear/yellow/chunky debris and then nothing but the cleaning solution itself. The result, I honestly felt blessed, like I had taken and extended bath in a Lazarus pit. Not only could I breathe better then ever (didnt really notice impaired breathing before due to the chronic nature of the problem) I could hear better, smell better, taste finer notes of foods, speak more clearly with deeper resonance, and slept like a hibernating bear. I combined that two time a day rinse regimen (three to start) with a Yeast-Fighters supplement. The supplement contains a Fiber Blend (psyllium husk, guar gum, apple pectin, chitosan) Lactobacilus Acidophilus, Garlic Bulb Extract, Herbal Extract Blend (pau d\'arco bark, onion bulb, golden seal, echinacea, black walnut seed) and Caprylic Acid. \n\nOverall result of this ten year investigative and perilous journey has been a success. I can feel my skin beginning to normalize, breakouts have ceased (except for the slow rise of some ancient deposits) I no longer have inflammation and my oil production has returned to a proper functioning status. I continue with the sinus rinse occasionally and still take a vitamin regimen, lots of water, and exercise. When I do get an occasional pimple or exhumed residual cyst I take a warm shower, carefully extract the core (only when ready) then ice the area or run cold water over my face for a few minutes. I then pat dry and apply tea tree and lavender oils as a spot treatment.\n\nAs for the scarring of old, I have found another super-product. Rosehip seed oil. It is an extremely lightweight oil, thinner in viscosity than jojoba and a retinol, high in Vitamin A, C, E and essential fatty acids(linoleic, linolenic, oleic, palmitic, and stearic.) I use it for both overnight spot treatment mixed with lavender oil and as a moisturizer for dry patches as I find it to be non-comedogenic and readily absorbed by the skin. It has a pleasant and subtle woodsy aroma. I\'ve noticed that the darker its tint the more effective it is. I usually apply a few drops to my fingers, pat onto slightly damp skin (better to ice/cool your face beforehand to increase effectiveness) allow to soak in for a few minutes then gently pat/blot the excess oil. I cannot express how grateful I am for this product and its effectiveness. As a retinoid, the oil can aggravate existing acne and should not be used over the entire face everyday. Remember, the healing will take time.\n\nWell it appears my story here has come to an end, I hope this reaches and helps as many people as possible so spread the word! I wish I had solved this years ago but the journey of battling this affliction has made me a stronger and more understanding person, not judging others by their appearance nor assuming causalities. I would be glad to answer any question you might have whether they pertain to the content of this post or something unrelated. Thank you for your time and keeping this valuable supportive community alive.\n'"

I drink a moderate amount of alcohol, and at prom pictures my vision is blurry, my skin becomes pale, slightly yellow, and I have to sit down and drink water in the shade -- only to get a fever late in the night (I had no thermometer with me at prom). I think I'm catching a flu, since I get chills before I feel sick, plus I had my Stelara injection the day before (and immunomodulator/suppressant).\n\n\n\nHow I Felt on Vyvanse (An Aside): I was interested in things that I had previously no interest in, I was keen to learn, and my mood was great. I had cold sweats, anxiety that came in waves, a low appetite, euphoria (for about 2-4 hours), I would get so caught up in work that I didn't realize a whole day had passed by while I was studying, and sometimes, I would get very frustrated with people very fast, causing outburst of yelling, or mean exchanges.\n\n\n\nBack to prom  The next day, I wake up drenched in sweat (to the point of changing my sheets -- no temperature though) only to get a temperature later in the day, of 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit). It goes away with Advil -- but other than the stuffy feeling in my ears and head, I feel very normal. The following days I have light fatigue and my doctor thinks I have mono. Blood tests and ultrasounds, along with a chest x-ray tell me I'm fine. Except, my first blood test which I had taken three days after my episode revealed very low platelet counts. They bounced back in a week, doubling in amount of what they were with the original test.\n\n\n\nFast forward to me being prescribed Concerta on August 2nd. I get anxiety, tingling hands, and chest, throbbing heart, and a general malicious and bad attitude. My focus was great, my memory the same. The first time I tried Vyvanse illegally my focus was insane, and I felt I could remember everything. However, my memory had begun to worsen at the end of my illegal self medication. On Vyvanse I had anger outbursts, but I was still empathetic, unlike Concerta, where I remained cool, but said some nasty stuff to people I love. My last week of Concerta, I was on 54 mg, but I felt it less than I did during the week of 32 mg, and the week before that with 18 mg. \n\n\n\nMy psychiatrist told me the anxiety had manifested into fatigue. A way of my body trying to get me to stop torturing it with stimulants. She prescribed me Vyvanse instead. 20 mg the first few days, then 40 the rest. The first few days I felt a little more awake, but it definitely was nothing like the first time I did it. And even nothing like the last few times. The first day of school comes around and I get no sleep because I'm nervous for school. Not a single hour. I wake up dead tired, and take a 40 mg vyvanse to wake me up. An hour in, as it sets in, my eyes become burning with tired, and I feel a certain weight in my forehead. I could fall asleep if I wasn't afraid of the repercussions in class. \n\n\n\nMy lymph nodes re-swell to the size they were during my episode in June, and my abdomen and stomach become bloated. The last three days I have felt pangs of pain, although not sharp, in my upper right abdomen, fullness in my upper left, and slight pangs in my bottom left. Nothing in the center, or the stomach, though. As my Vyvanse wears off, my lymph nodes shrink some, and if I don't take vyvanse for two days, they are back to a relatively small size, though, still larger than they were before I had ever even taken Vyvanse, when I didn't feel them at all.\n\n\n\nEverytime I take Vyvanse, the fatigue sets in as soon as Vyvanse is supposed to set in. I have zero focus, and I feel like my ADD is worse. Not to mention, my short term memory is as if I've eaten a pot edible. I forget things a few seconds after thinking about them. Emotion wise, I don't have anxiety, my insomnia isn't bad, but it's slightly there despite me being so tired. I also don't feel much urgency. My sex drive is nearly gone. I also don't feel depressed. I don't think as negatively as I did during this summer on the drug holiday, and I don't think nearly as deeply.\n\n\n\nIs Vyvanse making me tired, and compromising my immune system? Is Vyvanse making me sick? Conversely, am I sick, thus making Vyvanse ineffective? Every blood test I've taken says I'm not fighting an infection, at least not viral, and I've had the flu before, twice, while I was on methotrexate for my psoriasis and my lymph nodes didn't appear. Even worse, I wasn't even close to this tired with the flu. Do y'all recommend a medication I should ask my psychiatrist about? I'm seeing her on the 28th, but I'm calling her tomorrow to see if I can see her earlier.  Sorry for my tldr being long, but, I have to be thorough if I want accurate answers, and I need to be thorough in case someone is looking for someone to relate to. I want to know that if anyone is having my problems, that at least they aren't the only ones.\n\n\n\nTHE EVEN MORE DRAWN OUT EXPLAINATION (very detailed):\nhttps://pastebin.com/NNCpUJi9\n"""

I magically managed to fix the sore throat with rum, lemon etc.\n\nThe rash got a bit worse, so on day 2 I got a doctor's appointment in the morning because we were going to a vacation home later and it would be difficult to get to the doctor there.\n\nThe doctor didn't know exactly what it was, because I didn't have a fever and he thought it looked like yellow staphylococci. He took a test that we won't get the answer to until tomorrow. He has prescribed penicillin for me which is not working, yet hopefully.\n\nWe go to the holiday house and I think, now I'll get penicillin and it will go away in a little while, but from here it immediately got worse.\n\nMy rashes are spreading, they turn into blisters with liquid that itch and burn a lot.\nMy feet are the first thing to get really sore! I can't support them because they feel inflamed. Now it's my hands, I can't press or squeeze my fingers because they are so sore and my nails feel like they're falling off.\n\nLast night I couldn't sleep at all because I itched and burned all over. \nGot hold of the doctor on call and drove 1 hour to be seen last night. The doctor on the phone saw me on video and thought it was chicken pox, but I had that as a child.\nI drove an hour and was seen by another doctor.\nThe doctor could not help apart from the pencil line I was already given, because there were no skin specialists on the job yet. However, she gave me 25 mg of adrenocortical hormone, and back I drove because we had to get test results and the pencilline must be allowed to work. \nShe couldn't say what it was, but kept asking if I had been on holiday or with people who had been on holiday, because then she would have known a diagnosis, but I haven't.\n\nI take painkillers and 3x 800 mg penicillin (primicillin) every day. And after another phone consversation with my doctor this afternoon, I also get 2 x 150mg antihistamines called telfast.\n\nNo one can answer what it is, and things just get worse.\nMy feet are a little less sore this evening.\n\nAll the doctors have said it is not: scabies, hand mouth foot disease (don't know the English word). They have ruled out scarlet fever and partly also hives.\n\nHave you seen anything similar?\n\nPOSSIBLE REASONS I HAVE CONSIDERED THE FOLLOWING OR IMPORTANT FACTS:\n- I'm not allergic to anything\n- I am a butcher, and last week I cut myself many times, and I do not have a tetanus vaccination\n- 2 weeks ago I gave a punch so that my hand was blue and swollen and my little finger is crooked (if there could be inflammation in the joint)\n- I worked with harsh cleaning agents a week ago (with gloves)\n- I get elvanse daily and have also recently started intuniv\n- I have a dog\n- My wife and children aged 2 and 5 are fine, my wife got a sore throat at the same time as me but it's over."""
NSAID swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/21yf05/lithium_and_injury/,b'Lithium and Injury',,"b""I injured my foot badly in December (12/8/13, at least two broken metatarsals showed after they had healed on the second set of x-rays, they apparently could not be seen on the first, upon physical examination it appears I have a lot of soft tissue damage as well).  I've been unable to get Obamacare because I qualify for my states Medicaid but I can't get it through my state because a loophole in their system essentially disqualifies me (my state didn't take the federal money and doesn't have to play by Fed rules as a result).\n\nI've been unable to get regular treatment or any treatment outside two visits to the ER.  I was supposed to see an orthopedist, podiatrist, neurologist and physical therapist.  I haven't had the imaging studies I need to find out the actual problem (MRI, Cat Scan) since the ER apparently only does X-rays now.  The ER has since (2nd visit March 12th) diagnosed me with Reflexive Sympathetic Dystrophy, an incredibly painful neurological disorder that often begins with injury, I don't know if they're right but it is incredibly painful.  \n\nIn exactly a week I'll have been on crutches for four months and while my condition has improved it plateaued around month three and no longer appears to be getting better.  Throughout this I have yet to receive any adequate pain relief, I spent the first month in bed crying nearly non-stop from pain, it has improved but not enough.  \n\nI was given nebumatone an NSAID at the hospital which I didn't take because I'm on lithium (which they were well aware of and I voiced my concerns repeatedly).  Though I knew it had the potential to give me lithium toxicity after a few days it hurt so bad I didn't care and I filled the prescription and got a mild case of lithium toxicity.\n\nThe hospital refuses to give me anything but an nsaid for pain relief in spite of the contraindications.  I've stopped taking my lithium so I can get a little relief by taking this stupid drug that doesn't even do a good job relieving my pain, but it's better than Tylenol or nothing and I'm desperate my foot hurts so badly.\n\nI'm afraid to tell anyone I've gone off my lithium because I know how pissed my boyfriend, friends and family will be.  I know I haven't been myself, I walked away from my freelance job even though I desperately need the money.  I'm destabilizing rapidly, but I don't know what else to do. \n\nI've been in pain so long all my physical/emotional reserves for dealing with it are used up.  I can't sleep for more than a couple hours at a time, I can't walk.  If it is Reflexive Sympathetic Dystrophy my odds of walking normally ever again get worse the longer I am without aggressive treatment, especially physical therapy.\n\nIf I take these pills I can limp without my crutches I can do some of what I would do in physical therapy (broke the same foot in same places a little over a decade ago and remember how was rehabilitated last time).  \n\nI don't know what to do.  I'm not asking for advice I just need someone to listen because I can't tell anyone else.  I know it's a bad decision to go off my lithium but I don't see as I have any choice.  I need to be trying to rehab my foot and I can't do it if I don't have something to relieve pain and swelling.   Lithium has been one of my miracle drugs and I'm not doing well without it, there are no viable alternatives, I can't even afford to see my psychiatrist since I walked away from my freelance job.  \n\nI feel hopeless and helpless and the pain has made me suicidal for months now, they could have given me an opiate that wouldn't interfere with my meds but apparently no one does that anymore either; because drug seeking.  I don't understand why some people looking for drugs mean I can't get any relief.  I'm sorry so long but I just have no one else I can say any of this to and I needed to get it off my chest."""

I originally went on accutane about 12 years ago when I had severe cystic acne in high school. It was a painful process, but it worked WONDERS for my skin. \n\nI had clear (ish), manageable skin for years after, but about a year and a half ago, I decided to get the Mirena IUD. I was so excited not to have to worry about oral birth control anymore! SADLY, this specific hormonal IUD wreaked HAVOC on my skin. It wasnt as bad as my skin had been in high school, but it was consistent and very pesky. \n\nAbout a month ago, I removed my IUD due to the acne I was getting that was getting worse and worse, went back to the birth control pill I was on from before and I decided to go back to the dermatologist. \n\nWhen we spoke about my history and the toll it was taking on my mental health and energy, and because it worked so well for me previously, he OKd me for another round of lower dose accutane. 30mg per day for one month and then up to 60mg was the PLAN....\n\nI got all the blood work, got my prescription, and began. \n\nWithin 1 week, my skin was purging SO badly that it was too painful to sleep, eat and I had to use ice packs and Advil every day to knock out a tiny bit of the pain. My skin now looks about how it looked back in high school. Red, painful clusters of highly sensitive white heads, all coming at once. Its been really unbearable. I just talked to my dermatologist and told them i needed a plan for pain management because it was making me stay away from work it was so painful.\n\nHe has now prescribed me a cortisone topical cream and an antibiotic called Septra for one week to take down the inflammation. Apparently my body is having an inflammatory reaction this time around. He also took me back down to 10mg per day instead of 30mg to see. \n\nI searched and searched the internet for anyone else who has had this problem because I cant find anyone who has had this level of pain during this purging process. Maybe I just have a really low pain tolerance? Im not too sure. Im losing hope and would love to hear if anyone else had this struggle and how long it lasted if you did. \n\nPlease share your experience with me if youve had a similar reaction!'"

The night after this man cracked my back i felt an intense burn in my lower back kind of like a contraction when youre in labor and i could not move. I had to call out of work and i just cried because i couldnt walk. I went to the er for what felt like the 20 th time this year and they final did a CAT scan that showed a bulging disc. Later that month (still not able to walk and just unbearable pain in my right leg) i got an MRI that showed a 9mm disc herniation. I eventually went to PT where the dr. Told me that the herniation was too severe to reabsorb with just therapy and that i would need surgery. I didnt want to go with the orthopedist that my insurance sent me to so I did my research and found Dr. Khounganian (who im so thankful for! Check him out if youre in Los Angeles/San Fernando Valley). Im finally able to stand straight and exist without pain. I only have pain in the incision site but thats to be expected.

The only time the incision gets hurt is when i get back into bed because obviously my weight is squishing it but other than that Ive been goodZ my throat was still a little sore from the breathing tube but easily forgettable. \nDay 3 was better no more incision pain or drastic swelling around the wound (Ive been drinking a lot of arnica tea with fresh aloe vera because they do wonders for inflammation) Im still taking hydrocodone acetaminophen 5-325 every 5 ish hours and flexeril every 12. Ive been walking about 4 times a day 10 min each as my nurse practitioner instructed me to. \nRight now its 8 am day 4 and I didnt feel stiff this morning like i usually do but I am having sciatica symptoms on my buttcheek. You know that knot feeling you get in your buttcheek and it feels super tight? Its that but thank goodness no leg pain. Im going to try to walk a little more today because i do notice that my spine/back feels very weak at the beginning of my walks like it cant be straight it wobbles. Im also going to try to stop taking the hydrocodone today since i went about 7 hours without it and didnt feel pain (im just paranoid that im going to feel crippling pain like before surgery but im sure ill be fine its just the trauma of having sciatica pain for 10 months) \nIll be back! \nThanks for reading"""

Multiple doctors haven't found what's wrong""",,"b'Current Medications: Trazodone 150mg 1x per night, Pregabalin 200mg 2x per day\n\n29F, 5\'7"", 135lbs, white - below is a very detailed overview of my health. I am looking for anybody who can potentially lead me in which direction I should turn to next.\n\nShort Version: I\'ve had the same chronic pain in my left upper abdominal quadrant for 3 years, since March 2020. The pain is primarily located anteriorly just underneath the rib cage in the mid-clavicular line. The pain seems to be gradual throughout the day, with it being pretty severe at night, depending on what I am doing or how I am sitting. The pain will occasionally radiate to the back, up towards the sternum, and down towards the pubis and the groin on the left side. The pain is mostly positional, meaning I can relieve it by standing up, walking around, or lying down because it is most severe when I am sitting, whether that be driving, on the couch, at a table, etc. There is nothing that takes my pain away other than adjusting positions, but mostly laying down. No pain medications relieve my pain. (a detailed list of things I\'ve tried for pain will be at the bottom) I have had multiple imaging studies including a CTA of the abdomen/pelvis that showed possible Nutcracker syndrome with a 17 degree angle between the aorta and SMA with dilation of the left renal vein. I was evaluated by UW Madison for consideration of an autotransplant of my left kidney. However, after I underwent a venogram which showed equal pressures between the renal vein and IVC, Dr. Foley did not want to offer the surgery.  \nI also have had irregular menstrual cycles since I began having periods. Within the last few years, I feel like I almost get the ""period flu"" or have more PMDD symptoms before I\'m about to get it.\n\nLong Version: This all started in March 2020, my office had just moved to working from home with the Coronavirus outbreak. I hadn\'t gotten a desk/office chair for home yet, so I started out by sitting on my couch with my laptop in my lap for a couple of weeks. After about 3 weeks in I started to notice a bad pain in my left side. It was like a pinching/burning pain and it seemed to come on slowly the more I sat in the same position. My immediate thought was that it was like a ""side stitch"" or a cramp from the way I was kind of slouching and not sitting upright in a chair. I quickly made sure to get a desk and chair to see if it helped resolve the pain. Unfortunately, it did not. The more the days went on, the worse the pain was getting and it only seemed to be when I was sitting for longer periods of time. I had to start getting up more frequently and walking around or switching positions. I went to a chiropractor which did not alter the pain in any sort of way. The same chiropractor also tried a few laser therapy sessions over the affected area as well, with no relief.  \nThe pain was gradually becoming a permanent thing, and it became painful to wear a bra due to the pressure it caused around my ribs/where the pain is. I was trying everything I could think of to relieve the pain. At first I tried ibuprofen, Tylenol, heat, ice, heating pad, icy hot, cbd muscle rub, cannabis,  \nThe pain continued on and I started talking to my then primary doctor, I had an x-ray done of my ribs 04/2020 - which showed normal. I then had a chest x-ray and chest CT done 05/2020 - also normal. The pain continued through that fall and into 2021. I had c\\*v\\*d for the first time 11/22/2020.  \nIn spring of 2021 I had c\\*v\\*d again in March, so almost right at 90 days since first infection. I then started to get more serious about finding out what was wrong because I started to have a new pain in my left collarbone. It seemed like the whole bone would ache and the more I moved my arms(I had started cosmetology school in the fall of 2020) the worse the pain got. Sometimes the lightest touch from my shirt, a tank top, my cosmetology apron, or even my seat belt resting on my collarbone would cause immense pain. This lasted about a couple weeks at first, then it would go away for weeks/months, then it would come back randomly. I went to the emergency room one day in 03/2021 because I was so tired of being in so much pain, and had more chest x-rays done, which came back clear and normal. The collarbone pain has not bothered me for about 6 months now, but I have also been pretty sedentary since then. Fast forward to 06/15/2022 after my third round of c\\*v\\*d the beginning part of June, I started having the following symptoms for a month straight. I was physically so unwell, I could barely get up from laying down most of the time and could not go outside due to not being able to tolerate the heat, until I finally asked my doctor to run more labs, which all came back normal: dizziness, night sweats, severe intolerance to heat, severe loss of appetite and nausea, and new body odor(previously never had an issue with body odor). Since then, I have had periodic episodes that last weeks with severe loss of appetite(cannabis is the only way I can eat most of the time), some mild nausea(never any vomiting), lethargy, feeling hopeless, very mild night sweats, hotter body temperature while sleeping. And then I\'ll have weeks where I feel fine except my usual pain. On 01/26/2023 I traveled to Punta Cana for my sisters wedding. I suffered through the pain of sitting for an extended period of time on the plane ride. While there, I virtually had no appetite my first night and the next morning/afternoon. And then my appetite came back and my pain went almost completely away for almost 4 days, until I went back home. I ate Taco Bell at the airport and had almost immediate pain from sitting on the plane again, and the pain has been present every day since.\n\n01/25/2023 Urology consult: CHIEF COMPLAINT: left sided pain; concern for Nutcracker syndrome. Impression: 29 FEMALE with pain that has been difficult to identify a cause and treat. She  \ndoes have a narrow angle between the SMA and aorta with slight dilation of the  \nleft renal vein. However, there is no pressure difference between the left renal  \nvein and IVC indicating that while there may be slight anatomic abnormality,  \nthis doesn\'t necessarily indicatee Nutcracker syndrome which would be  \ncharacterized by left flank pain due to elevated pressure in the left renal vein  \n(and kidney) due to compression of the vein. Additionally, her pain is not  \nclassic kidney pain based on description (stabbing/burning and anterior). Additionally, she has several indicators for possible Ehlers-Danlos and her pain may have a myofascial componenent.\n\n10/25/2022 I saw an Integrative Health Practitioner who ran some tests for celiac disease.  \ndeamidated gliadin abs, IgA - 4  \ndeamidated gliadin abs, IgG - 1  \nT-transglutaminase (ttg) IgA <2  \nT-transglutaminase (ttg) IgG <2  \nendomysial antibody IgA: negative  \nimmunoglobulin A, qn, serum: 51  \namylase: 73  \nlipase: 20\n\n11/07/2022 GI Consult outside of the VA, Impression: ""does not sound GI related in the slightest.

codeine constipation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/xchczt/brutally_honest_assessment_after_surgery/,b'Brutally Honest Assessment After Surgery',,"b'Hi everyone!  38m here - back in June/July, I obsessively poured over anything I could find regarding before/during/after expectations after a microdiscectomy.  I had a L4-L5 right 18mm extrusion impinging my canal anywhere between 50-75%.  I have DDD, stenosis, and lumbar lordosis in multiple areas and annular tears in a few discs.  Before I go on, a little history:\n\n* I had a L5 - S1 herniation in 2016 that resulted in drop foot that lasted a few months, but then went away \\[I had no idea I had herniated back then\\].  \n* In 2018, randomly started having extreme pain after standing for 20 seconds \\[could not stand\\].  MRI confirmed L4 and L5 herniation.  Doc said I would need surgery but wanted to try ESI.  8 days post ESI all symptoms went away \\[and followed up with 2 more ESIs a few weeks later\\].  Did PT for a few weeks and felt great. Pretty much no issues for 4 years.\n* April/May 2022 felt a twinge in that area that got progressively worse.  Flare ups were nothing new to me and they always resolved in a few days/weeks the past 4 years.  This did not and only got worse with significant nerve pain.  MRI confirmed the 18mm listed above, and re-confirmed the DDD, stenosis, and lordosis.\n\nI see lots of folks either for or against surgery.  We all have our reasons.  My nerve pain and buttock pain was worse in the AM upon waking and awful at night going to bed.  During the day I could have times where there was 0 pain.   I opted for surgery because I hated thinking about the pain 24/7, affecting my time with my wife and kids.\n\nThat said, for the folks that got MDs, in many instances some of the nuances are glossed over.  I hope my notes below help you out.\n\n**For anyone considering getting a microdiscectomy, this is specifically for you:**\n\n* I woke up from surgery with the buttock and nerve pain in my right leg immediately gone\n* My anethesiologist botched my trach tube and pinched my uvula and tore my throat up.  This was worse then my actual back incision.  It took 2 weeks for my uvula to go back to normal.  Up til then it was like I was swallowing it every time \n* The back incision was tender, sore and stiff, but I would not have categorized it as painful.  It was better than the nerve pain.\n* Surgery was around 1pm on July 27th.  I went home a few hours later.  Immediately slept the rest of the day.\n* Back was extremely stiff, had to be mindful of log rolling and getting in and out of bed.  Could not sleep on my back for the first week, had to sleep on my side due to the tenderness of the incision.\n* The constipation from the pain meds is real. Do not slack on your stool softeners.  My first BM was 3 days post surgery and I honestly feel passing that first BM was worse pain then the surgery.  I only took Tylenol and Codeine and muscle relaxers for 3 days after the surgery.  After that, just Tylenol as needed.\n* Sleeping those first few days, I would wake up every 4 hours to use the bathroom.  Lots of liquids throughout the day.\n* My surgeon ordered me at home PT and Nurse - I am grateful as the nurse changed my bandage, and the PT kept me mobile.\n   * Although - I could walk up the stairs in shuffles the first day.  By Day 5 I could body weight squats to pick things up.\n* Sitting was difficult until week 4 where it finally started to feel better.  At week 7 I can sit 95% normally\n* I drank a ton of protein shakes and BCAA/amino acid drinks for recovery, along with my multivitamin.  I really think this helped shorten my recovery time.  After 2 weeks, my surgeon cleared me for PT and I made significant process daily since then.\n* The hardest part of recovery for me has been the mental part of trying a movement or being afraid of re-herniation.  My PT has worked with me a lot to help me regain my confidence in my movements.\n* I was able to walk 2+ miles by Day 5\n\nI am just shy of 7 weeks post-op and I feel amazing.  Every once in awhile if I sit too long my back will spasm (usually when I try getting out a car), or I will have a phantom pain in my buttock \\[remember, I still have stenosis and some impingement in my foramen, but I still have 0 pain levels at the moment\\].  These are nothing compared to the pain I had experienced before the surgery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor anyone on the fence, I hope you find my experience helpful.   It is a lot of work, but I would do it all over again for the results so far.'"

What should I expect?',,"b""  Hello, I've gone through three different treatment medications in the past 3/4 months (Lamotrigine, Gabapentin, and now Latuda). My APRN changed my medication off of Lamotrigine because I developed the skin rash. Gabapentin wasn't terribly effectively for me so I have now been put on an antipsychotic as opposed to an anticonvulsant. I'm not sure what to expect out of the medication shift. There's going to be just a few days between when I get off of Gabapentin and start Latuda. I read that Gabapentin can be detected in your system around 3-4 days after you cease taking it, and I also read on WebMD that it is not recommended for Gabapentin and Latuda to be taken together. Furthermore, I noticed that Latuda could cause a decrease in white blood cells, this caught my attention because I am also anemic and have some mild concerns here as well. I'm waiting to get an appointment for blood work as of today. Sorry for the longish read but anything I should be concerned with? I have researched what I can but I'd like to hear if anyone has dealt with these. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks!"""
antimicrobial swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcneScars/comments/t3hsb7/how_effective_is_aloe_vera_for_acne/,b'How Effective is Aloe vera for Acne?',,"b"" \n\nAcne is an extremely common problem among people of all ages, especially among teenagers and women going through menopause. It is embarrassing, it is frustrating, and it seems like it is never going to go away. While we may be able to control some of it depending on what we eat and what our stress levels are like, sometimes breakouts can appear without any warning. Luckily, there are many natural ingredients like Aloe Vera, which can help you reduce your breakouts and cure your acne-prone skin.\n\n## [Aloe Vera for Acne](https://biocule.com/bioedge/research/aloe-barbadensis-leaf-juice)\n\nAloe vera is a natural anti-inflammatory that can help reduce red marks left on the skin by acne. Aloe vera contains lignin, which improves the skin's ability to hydrate itself, promoting cell turnover and healthy tissue growth. Aloe vera also contains salicylic acid, which helps clear dead skin cells that clog pores.\n\nAcne scars will fade in time, but aloe vera may help speed up the process. The anti-inflammatory properties of [aloe vera for acne scars](https://biocule.com/bioedge/research/aloe-barbadensis-leaf-juice) reduce swelling and redness, while its antimicrobial properties kill bacteria that may be contributing to the infection of individual pimples as well as breakouts as a whole.\n\n## [How to Use Aloe Vera for Acne Scars?](https://biocule.com/bioedge/research/aloe-barbadensis-leaf-juice)\n\n**Apply Aloe Vera Directly on Acne Scars -** Extract fresh aloe vera gel from a leaf of the aloe vera plant and apply directly to the affected area. Leave it on for half an hour, then wash the gel off with water. Pat your face dry and apply a moisturizer to hydrate your skin. Repeat this twice daily for best results.\n\n**Aloe Vera Mask -** Squeeze half a lemon into a bowl. Add two tablespoons of aloe vera gel and one tablespoon of cinnamon powder to it. Mix it together to make a paste and apply it evenly to your face. Leave it for 20 minutes and wash it off with water.\n\nYou can also use honey and aloe vera. Honey is a natural antiseptic that helps in healing acne scars while cinnamon has anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce the appearance of scars."""

I passed approx. 1-2 a day. \n\nI called my SIL on March 12th who is an OBGYN/delivery flight nurse who told me her hypothesis was that my IUD was implanted and that the menstrual cup was causing suction and trauma everytime it was removed from my vaginal canal. \n\nOn March 13th, i was still passing clots and in immense pain. I called my Mom\'s OBGYN who delivered all three of my younger sisters, told him who I was and his treatment of my family, and the story, and he had me come in same day for an emergent visit. He stated he also believed it was my IUD and my cup and removed my IUD that day. Bleeding stopped 3 hours after removal. He also stated ""I have removed thousands of IUD\'s in my 40 years and this one had the most clotting I\'ve ever seen"".\n\nThe next day I came back to him- at this point I was spotting- for a follow up US. He told me after reading it I had a benign cyst in my right ovary and a 2-3cm polyp in my uterus. He scheduled me for a D&C on April 19th and put me on Estarylla for treatment of the cyst and would follow up with me to make sure it did not grow. \n\nI have been on Estarylla for 6 weeks now and started taking the sugar pills 2 weeks ago (estimated). I woke up on the 3rd week of taking BC pills and began bleeding heavy. I began bleeding through 1 pad every 30 minutes (not maxi pads, as they have started giving me intense irritation from the dyes, bleach, and carcinogens. These are just super pads) and changing super tampons every half hour AND STILL bleeding through my clothes. I have stopped using a menstrual cup, as a lot of the providers at work think the cup could be causing the clotting or the blood is clotting in my cup and that\'s what I am seeing. I DC\'ed my cup just to be sure. I am currently not on an IUD. \n\n3 days into the 3rd round of hormonal BC pills, I started passing the large clots again. My pain was INTENSE, started as a sharp right sided pain that has spread/radiated through my whole lower abdomen and back, onset April 8th. I have used midol, Naprosyn, Tylenol, ibuprofen, heat packs, and have gotten a shot of dexamethasone, ketorolac, and promethazine with no relief. I was crying all day every day,, my back and abdomen would just HURT. I was nauseous and can barely bend, breathe, or walk. \n\nOn April 10th, I called my OB, and he told me I could get Norco from my work, as I was not allowed to take anything but acetaminophen 10 days prior to surgery, but acetaminophen did not touch it. The NP at work did an abdominal CT to check for a ruptured cyst causing free fluid in my abdomen. My blood work and CT were normal. I went home and took Norco and woke up 2 hours after taking it due to the severity of the pain. \n\nThe next day (April 11) I went to the ER per my OB because of the pain. They did an ultrasound and pelvic exam and ran urine and blood work and it was all normal.\n\nIt is now April 23rd. I\'ve had to buy a cane to walk because I have shooting pains down my left leg, I get numbness and tingling in my left arm and fingers. My pain starts in my back where my reproductive organs sit and radiates through my whole body, but i cannot stress this enough: the pain is in my bones. I feel like i constantly have knives or nails being driven into my bones, all over my whole body, but especially my extremities, and worse in the left side. My lower left leg constantly feels like it is being crushed in a vice. Every once in a while I get sharp, shooting pains in my bones. I have had no recent trauma\n\nMy bleeding has stopped, and my D&C went without issues, but the pain does not let up. Norco still doesn\'t touch it, heat barely helps. I wake up and go to sleep in pain. My whole back feels HORRENDOUS and my legs are weak. I am extremely fatigued, depressed, and emotional. I am having migraines every day.\n\nOther associated symptoms; lightheadedness/Dizziness with random onsets, no syncope, a constant pressure headache that feels like it\'s in my whole skull, loss of appetite, extreme fatigue, loss of feeling in my left fingertips, irritability, depression, soft stool with an urgency to go, pain and numbness during and after sex in lower back and legs, and pronounced bags under my eyes.\n\nApril 18th I saw my PCP who said my blood draws show negative for risk of leukemia (I was worried about this so I asked for a read of my labs) and imaging shows no tumors in bones. He prescribed me gabapentin because he thinks it could be nerve pain, but it provides no relief. \n\nIf you read this all...thank you. Thank you so much. I have asked so many medical professionals, i feel lost and hopeless.'"
Tetracycline itch,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/ulrrib/i_am_so_tired/,b'I Am So Tired',,"b""I AM SO TIRED\n\nI am so tired of struggling with acne. I have been fighting this fight for more than two decades. I am so tired.\n\nI am so tired of looking in the mirror literally hundreds of times a day. Investigating every little crevasse and corner, every shade and nuance, every slight bump, every cyst, everything. Under every conceivable types of lighting, in front of every mirror at home, at school, at work, at the cafe, at my family's house. Worrying over every change, every new arrival, every old arrivals too, stuff from three weeks ago that still shows discoloration. I know the topography of my face better than satellite images could ever know the Earth. \n\nI am so tired of the routine, that careful use of cleanser, medicine, product, moisturizer, sun screen, make-up, every morning, every evening, every shower. It must be weighed and applied to perfecting otherwise it will destroy my face more than it is already destroyed. Or so I tell myself. \n\nI am so tired of watching everything I eat, everything I drink, everything I touch, for fear that it might affect my acne. They say there is no solid evidence diet affects acne but I swear, 20 years of dealing with this shit, if I so much as think about cake or candy or pastries or soda or alcohol or cheese or white rice or anything, my face breaks out like some Kool and the Gang anthem. And of course any change for the worse is a cause for temporary episodes of depression. Or permanent ones.\n\nI am so tired of spending every waking hour of every day concerned about my face. About how that little bump will look at what distance, what people will think about me. But mostly what I think about myself. I am scared to look at people before I've done my routine in the morning, even my kids. How the fuck are they to understand it. I try to smile but I can't. \n\nI am so tired of the cover-up. Of agonizing over finding the right of concealer and matte creme and God knows what - always comedogenic, oil free, no perfume, containing none of 1600 different ingredients that could upset that delicate balance of oil and moist and bacteria on my face. Hundreds of dollars each, of course, because why should reducing your crippling acne-induced depression be cheap. \n\nI am so tired of the medicines. I have tried antibiotics - three different kinds of benzoyl peroxide treatments, plus tetracycline. I have tried retinoids, I have tried azelaic acid - two different treatments, you name it. I have tried isotretinoin (that's Accutane to you Americans), two rounds of one year. I have tried ivermectin (no not to treat covid, Jesus Christ). Sure it has reduced my acne from insane levels in my teens but how the fuck can I be turning 40 having exhausted all medical options. That makes me so tired.\n\nI am so tired of the side-effects. The redness, the itching, the dryness, your liver might be permanently fucked.\n\nI am so tired of doctors saying it's not so bad. It's fucking bad. It's a medical problem but yes it's also a psychological problem. I tried extended therapy treatment with a psychologist. It was okay. It didn't really make much of a different. It just made me more tired, so tired.\n\nI am so tired of the summer and that damned sun. Sun exposure can temporarily improve your acne. But long term it makes it massively worse. Fucking great. I haven't left the shade in twenty years. You know how hard that makes any type of popular summer vacation? It's like trying to dodge landmines in a war zone.\n\nI am so tired of withdrawing from everything. The number of social events I have declined because of acne is innumerable. Even when I'm there, if my acne's bad, I try to hide. I don't look at anyone. I spend hours in the bathroom. I sit in the corner looking at my phone to avoid interaction. I'm a grown fucking person! I shouldn't have to do this. But I have to. Apparently.\n\nI AM SO TIRED"""

I am 27 year old guy recently diagnosed with BP-2. In addition I have anxiety and substance abuse issues (mainly opiates and alcohol). On the other hand I am a design engineer working R&D and take a huge pride in what I do.\n\nNow - I have already switched doctors asking for another opinion - and the new doctor (just as the previous one) strongly recommends taking anticonvulsants as a base drug.\n\nI have tried two of them with the same result - I have become totally brain dead within several hours from the first dose and remained in this state for a week, even though I did not redose later on. I was not able to work - it was impossible for me to focus to design a very simple part. I had to fall back to a drafter role for couple of days (and even that was hard for me).\n\nMy doctor encourages me to start the treatment with even smaller initial doses and large intervals between any increment. She says that the bad symptoms will go away with time (that I do not have).\n\nYes - these drugs do eliminate my anxiety. My thoughts stop racing and I do not feel the urge to get high. The thing is though - I do not trust that I could be mentally as sharp as I am even after this initial phase. And sure enough - when I am depressed I sometimes cannot wake up to go to work - but once I am at the place I can force myself to do something. Anything. Sometimes I am still high from the evening before. Sometimes hungover. I even designed something when I was still drunk. Yeah, boose and opiates impair me hugely but usually it is just one day or even several hours of potential loss. Not weeks. And still I can force myself to imagine something. Not the case when I take valproate. If I take valproate the imagination is completely gone. All tasks that are short term memory intensive are virtually paralyzed.\n\nSo having said that I have a question. Is it actually the case that the brain finally finds its way of thinking after a prolonged anticonvulsant use? If so - how much time off would I need?\n\nAfter all I am still open to improve some things. I tolerate olanzapine and quetiapine quite well (but they are not quite effective ;)).\n\nI definitely need to stay creative. It is almost the only thing I value about myself. I am afraid I could lose it the longer I self medicate.\n\nAnyways. Thanks for reading my story. I will appreciate every input.\n\nNever forget who you are. Cheers!'"

How long until you can wear a partial?'",,"b'My husband had 6 very bad teeth removed last night, it took hours, they kept breaking and crumbling and pretty much had to be dug out of his gums. I sort of felt like for this situation he should\'ve been seen by an oral surgeon. It took nearly 4 hours. Honestly I thought my husband\'s teeth were so bad that he should\'ve just opted to get dentures. He\'s had 5-10 fillings in back teeth, 3-4 teeth pulled, most of the top front teeth are all either knocked out or snapped at the gum line and most of the remaining teeth that are there have no enamel\nleft, and have severe cavities at the gum line. I thought for sure there was just no other option than to take them all out and have dentures put in.\nBut...The dentist convinced my husband to opt for having a\nseries of procedures instead because he had ""a few usable teeth"" remaining. \nTo date this dentist has added 4 new fillings, 4 route canals and 2 crowns. Last night they were going in to removed the remaining teeth so that my husband could be given a partial and although I thought he would be sent to oral surgeon, it was done in office with a local anesthetic. I was told it was done that way because the dentist was trying to ""help us"" reserve some available funds on the insurance so\nthat we could bill for a temporary partial, a nicer permanent partial and a couple implants, and keep our part of the cost down. So far we\'re in for over $1,000 out of pocket even with really good dental insurance that most people would kill to have. \nMy husband is in a world of pain right now, he was given ibuprofen and penicillin but it\'s not really doing much for him. When he woke up his pillow was covered in blood that leaked from his mouth. His lips, cheeks, and even under his eyes are all swollen. His gums have a decent amount of swelling and stitches.\n\n**Now that I\'ve given you a history, here are my questions...**\n\n**1- Do you agree with the procedures not being done by a surgeon and the way this was\ndone in office with only local anesthetic and no narcotic pain medication?**\n\n**2 - He was sent home with the temporary partial, how long should he wait to wear it? I have perfect teeth so I don\'t know from experience but I think common sense says he should wait at least until the swelling goes down, and maybe even until fully healed. \nThe dentist said he could wear it right away though, so rather than go to work with all his front\nteeth missing, and rather than take my advice, my stubborn husband forced the damn partial into his mouth this morning even with all that swelling and with fresh sutures in his gums**\n\n**3- Would you have ever advised a patient of yours to have this amount of work done rather than having all the teeth removed and giving them dentures? Is it just a matter of opinion, or is there a standard for how much dental work is too much to recommend a patient endure?**'"

So my 18 birthday comes around feeling confident because I lost 44 lbs, only then suddenly acne comes around and unlike before it was alot. So I decide to go to my GP again he decides to prescribe me tetracycline, mean while I get depressed, I am afraid to go outside and as a result dropped out of college and rarely came outside. Luckily my parents are understanding and understood that pushing me to go outside would just make me more miserable. Anyway the tetracycline made me noxious all the time and barely put a dent in the acne, so he prescribes me doxycycline and after that minocycline, all that didnt work and just made me hopeless since 4 months had passed and my life is put on hold. My GP forwarded me to a dermatologist who prescribed me accutane 40mg a day and needed to get a bloodtest done monthly and told me to read the side effects. 1 month passes by havent noticed any side effects and the size of the pimples had decreased significantly only problem the bloodtest came out a bit worry some so the dermatologist decided to reduce it to 30mg a day month two comes along the acne has dissapeared almost completely and only red scars remain and some pimples, bloodtest is good so it keeps going this way a few months pass and I am starting to get back into life I am going outside again meeting my friends etc I apply for college again everything goes great the only side effects are dry lips, dry eyes in the morning and backpain/legpain after working out. The treatment goes on and after a year of taking accutane I have zero pimples and zero blackheads and best of all life is smiling again for me. This was 4 months ago and my skin is almost the same as when I quit accutane. The only permenant side effect is mildly dry lips. Just wanted to share my story.\n\nTo all people who read this and suffer from acne, I hope you get rid of it soon.'"
penicillin swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/wtao0n/any_stoppedearly_success_stories/,b'Any stopped-early success stories?',,"b""I (31F, mild-moderate hormonal acne) started my course in April and reached 5,400mg total. Cumulative dose for my weight (123ish lb) is 6,695-8,400. I haven't had a pimple for about two months. \n\nI stopped Accutane Monday at the suggestion of my derm: late June, I had a few spots pop up on my face that itched and secreted honey-yellow fluid that dried into a crust. (If this happens to you, TELL YOUR DERM IMMEDIATELY.) My derm diagnosed impetigo and prescribed a topical antibiotic, then an oral antibiotic (doxy) when the topical alone didn't work. She took samples to culture, but due to scheduling issues, they were too close to when I finished using the topical antibiotic to grow anything. The topical/doxy didn't work, but it was manageable - two or three small spots around my nose/cheeks - until a week ago. My derm didn't want to prescribe another antibiotic without a culture to know what specific strain of bacteria we needed to combat; a combination of travel and insurance issues meant the second culture was postponed. \n\nLast Friday the impetigo overtook my face and neck (possibly because I sneezed into a mask and couldn't wash my face for a solid hour). I started a round of Bactrim Tuesday, and when that didn't work, Penicillin on Thursday - which is *finally* working. She took samples for a culture on Tuesday and they're not back yet, but thanks to the failed doxy and Bactrim, chances are high that it's caused by Group A Strep that I've carried in my nose for who knows how long. Normally, a healthy skin barrier prevents nasal-carry bacteria from causing skin infections; an unholy combination of weakened skin from Accutane, busy immune system due to Covid in June, and a skin allergy (dermatographia) making all of the inflammation worse meant my skin couldn't deal. \n\nThe all-over impetigo is/was the most pain I've been in in my adult life. It felt like my skin was badly sunburnt at first and progressed to feeling like my skin was actively being burnt and peeled off. It hurt to move my face, it hurt to not move my face, and the swelling was so bad I could barely see. Understandably, this is NOT an experience I want to repeat (and again, if you have itchy sores that ooze yellow fluid, TELL YOUR DERM IMMEDIATELY).\n\nI'm off Accutane to give my skin the best chance to heal. Chances are slim that the impetigo will come back, because a successful antibiotic treatment should kill the root cause (and I've been militantly cleaning/bleaching everything my face/neck touches), but it's still possible. My derm mentioned yesterday that she might suggest me stopping Accutane altogether just in case, and to be honest, I'd rather deal with the mild-moderate acne than more impetigo. Other complicating factor is I'd like to try and have kids in the next year, so a longer-term low dose regimen to finished my course isn't super appealing. \n\nTL;DR: severe skin infection meant I paused Accutane at just over 3/4 of my cumulative dose. Possibility of the infection reoccurring means I may not go back on Accutane. \n\nHas anyone stopped at a similar point in their dose? Did your skin stay clear? Did you use any topical?"""

antimicrobial rash,https://www.reddit.com/r/DermatologyQuestions/comments/jodtkx/athletes_foot_toenail_fungus/,"b""Athlete's Foot / Toenail Fungus""",,"b""Hi all, I've been lurking this and other threads on this issue for a while now, but figure the time has come for me to make my own post.\n\nOver the last two years or so, I noticed a fungal infection in my right big toenail, which consequently, spread to my other toes on that foot, and eventually to my left big toe as well. \n\nAbout a month and a half ago, I contracted a bad case of athlete's foot. Upon realizing that, I tried...eh, just a few things: Lotrimin cream, Odor Eaters spray, coconut oil with tea tree and cinnamon essential oil, Aquaphor, Gold Bond powder and spray, Neosporin, Vinegar foot soaks, Epsom salts, Ozonated sunflower oil, drying feet with hair dryer after showering, sterilizing shoes with UV, washing laundry in hot water with vinegar/laundry sanitizer and applying urea to problem areas occasionally for the antifungals to work their magic. Some of these I am still doing/using.\n\nI had been prescribed Penlac, but broke out in a weird face rash a day or two into using it and perhaps irrationally, attributed it to the Rx and ceased treatment. (I have since had another dry, scaly breakout on my face, so I think there may be another trigger somewhere else). \n\nTrimming the big right toe incorrectly led to an ingrown toenail, so I was also prescribed Mupirocin to deal with any potential bacteria infection. I apply this sporadically.\n\nJust over three weeks ago, I started taking oral terbinafine and have seen some improvement in a few nails and, admittedly, a little in the athlete's foot. It is less inflamed most of the time and the swelling is gone, but whereas it started on just the tops of my toes, it has now evolved to affect the bottoms of them, as well as the sole of my foot, in between a few toes AND the top of my foot. It itches like mad, especially at night. I have taken Claritin here and there, and especially when I had the face rash, to help me sleep, but I'd rather find a more permanent solution.\n\nLately I've been applying O'Keeffe's Healthy Feet and Absorbine Jr Plus to it (the latter of which I'm surprised to not see more mention of here; I found people who swore by it for their AF on other sites). It's too soon to tell if it's working though, which now leads me to my questions.\n\n1. I've switched to merino wool socks, as I've seen differing opinions on cotton and polyester online. Which is best? Merino is expensive and with COVID, well... Money's tight. Assuming I wouldn't have to eventually throw them away (if using hot water and vinegar in my washing machine), I could probably afford to purchase more though.\n\n2. What about my shoes? I currently switch between a pair of Vans and Blundstone boots. Again, I'm using a SteriShoe on them and swapping them out daily, but could they be too far gone? If so, what are some good recommendations for breathable, possibly even antimicrobial shoes and/or sandals that cover unsightly feet but still allow airflow? Any materials I should look for and/or avoid when shopping?\n\n3. How does one go about cleaning with AF? My apartment is sadly carpeted (just researched, priced out and asked landlord for laminate - no go) and while we're getting the floors professionally cleaned in a week or so, I'm afraid of recontamination. I don't want to wear shoes indoors all the time, but am embarrassed and don't want to wear flip flops around my roommate just yet. Would socks be okay?\n\n4. Should I reconsider using the Penlac? The doc who prescribed the Mupirocin said topicals for the AF were likely useless at this point, but I've read to continue using something for nail fungus in conjunction with the oral Rx. \n\n5. I plan on completing the full course (12 weeks) of the terbinafine and just hope it's not extended by the end of all this. I also understand the nail fungus is tough to treat... but how long should I expect to wait to see full results of the athlete's foot? It's been my understanding after some research that it should clear up fairly quickly with such a strong antifungal, if not be totally gone by now. If it's a matter of good things coming to those who wait, what can I use for the itching in the meantime, at the very least?\n\n6. Could it be candida-related? Due to poor circulation? Does keto really help? (I've seen claims.) What other physiological underlying problems could be causing this?\n\n\nIt's becoming such a pain and strain, specifically on my mental health and my relationship. I've been choosing not to stay nights with my boyfriend, as not only is it such an ugly thing, but a contagious one, and the itching at night is unbearable.\n\nAny help you can give would be greatly appreciated!

NSAID problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/550crl/side_effects_on_spironolactone_professional/,b'Side effects on spironolactone? Professional advice or personal experience appreciated.',,"b""So Im on month 2 of spiro. Acne has decreased alot since I've started. I didn't expect much with side effects and neither did my derm tell me to worry about them. In the past month, I started having on and off pain in one of my toes. I didn't think much of it; figured I probably had a slight sprain as I'm reasonably active. Last week, after a dance class, I went home and noticed my toe was extremely swollen and hurt. It didn't go away overnight so I went to a podiatrist the next morning. He said the spironolactone may be causing uric acid to build up and therefore causing the inflammation. He gave me naproxen and told me to take it twice a day for 10 days. Two days later, I go to work. Horrible stomach ache, chills, fever, dizzy, headache, cant seem to stay awake, very thirsty, no desire to eat but feel starved even after eating. \n\nI wasnt able to see a doctor because, well, I cant drive in this condition. I did text a friend whose a pharmacist and she was shocked I'd be prescribed an NSAID (naproxen) with spironolactone. She told me to drink pedialyte because I might be losing too many electrolytes. Spoke to another friend whose in rotations right now and he said that my taking omega-3 supplements would also not mix well with the drug. Basically my blood pressure might get too low, other meds increase chance of the side effects (which clearly seemed to be happening), etc. He basically called my doctor an idiot since I put all medications on my medical history. \n\nSo. problem now is that 1) I have abandoned all medications and I'm not sure what to take and how to take it. 2) My doctor and I don't mix with schedules until saturday morning\n\nWhich is why I'm hoping someone has some insight. Has anyone else had anything similar happen to them while on this medication? Also, note that I've experienced the side effects minimally before too. Just sucked it up and went about my day all of the previous times."""

I have had them for years and dentists have never commented on them, but I'm reading online that if there is any significant gum recession then it is actually a proper problem \n\nThe second is basically to do with things I was told ages ago and so can't remember half the details. I have always had fairly bad teeth, with significant amounts of calculus having to be scraped off every visit to the dentist or hygienist. My dentist always told me off for not brushing - and when I protested that I did brush my teeth enough, she would say it must be my brushing technique. But when she actually bothered to check my technique she discovered it was good, and concluded that I must be lying about actually brushing them - with me being like, well, that's nice, dear, but it's simply not true, so what is going on? Needless to say she just stuck to her unfounded point of view. \n\nNow, I remember at some point hearing something about some condition that affects some other body part (I did say I had forgotten details...) that often co-occurred with (and I think caused) poor dental health despite good oral hygiene practices. The condition was something that I either have or plausibly could have - which doesn't narrow it down that much as my health is not great (but the main physical issue is epilepsy; I also have endocrine issues being investigated). \n\nThen at some point the hygienist, after sorting my teeth out, applied some magic antimicrobial gel (or some substance, I don't remember precisely) to my gums. This, combined with my normal oral hygiene, kept my teeth actually clean for the next 6 months. I was given it on one other occasion and it worked then as well. What is this stuff? Evidently I need to ask for it every time (there were a few years where I didn't go at all hence me forgetting). I also wonder if the fact that it was highly effective for me indicates what it is that causes so much build-up in the first place? Is it strange flora, or excessively acidic or alkaline saliva, something like that? \n\n(I don't drink or smoke)"""

codeine vomit,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/kmreag/severe_persistent_cough_for_6_weeks_now/,"b'Severe, persistent cough for ~6 weeks, now hospitalized--and no diagnosis'",,"b'Hello all! I\'m writing this post on behalf of my fianc, who is currently in the hospital due to his severe, persistent cough that he has had for nearly 6 weeks now. Some specs on him; he is 34 (going to be 35), \\~230 pounds, 5\' 11""; not a smoker, pretty active (he used to run anywhere from 3-10 miles a day), doesn\'t have/never had asthma, and is currently employed at a warehouse that packs/ships a variety of things, everything from adhesives to aerosols.\n\nBack in mid-November, my fianc noticed that he had a cough and was feeling a little ""off"". It was a weekend and prior to going in to work on Monday, he called ahead to his supervisor, notifying him that he had a cough; given all the COVID precautions in place, his supervisor suggested that he go to a walk-in clinic to get tested for COVID. So, my fianc did so; he got a COVID test and the result was negative. However, the doctor thought that his cough sounded a bit  more like bronchitis and gave him a course of antibiotics (azithromycin) plus steroids (prednisone). They also took a chest x-ray at the time, but it came back clear (no indication of any infection or fluid in the lungs). After that doctor visit, my fianc completely finished both courses of antibiotics and steroids, felt OK for a few days, but the cough came back.\n\nHis cough was (and had been) non-productive and felt and seemed higher up in his chest. He continued like this for a few days until he went back to the doctor, again; because the antibiotics did not seem to have worked, they figured it was viral and instead prescribed another round of steroids. The cough seemed to get worse and at times, it was slightly productive (he would sometimes cough up yellow or clear or green phlegm, but often nothing at all). He also started to get these severe coughing attacks and would cough so hard that he would gag and sometimes vomit. But, over these last 6 weeks, he\'s never had any other symptoms beyond the coughing; no fever, no stuffy nose, no congestion, nothing. Then, during his second round of steroids, about 3 days in, he had a very bad reaction to the steroids; he went completely pale, felt cool and clammy, could not breathe well, was wheezing, and his arms and legs began to go numb. Our doctor told us to go to the ER immediately and we did. They took his vitals, they took a blood sample, and ran another COVID test; he was completely normal, bloodwork was all normal (no elevated white blood cell count), and negative for his COVID test. They took another chest x-ray but it also came back clear. They checked his breathing (as they had in previous visits) but his lungs sounded completely clear. In time, at the ER, he was able to breathe better and they also administered an anti-anxiety medication which helped. After that, we went back home, but his cough wasn\'t going away, and wasn\'t getting any better.\n\nAfter about another week, we went back to my fianc\'s primary physician, again, and he prescribed, again, a round of azithromycin and prednisone. My fianc finished both courses of those last week, but with no sign of improvement. Over the weekend, too, my fianc had an especially bad fit of coughing and suddenly had a splitting headache; he was coughing so hard and all of sudden, he said that it ""felt like part of his brain exploded."" He developed a really bad migraine and was in the bed for a couple days; since then, he has had headaches on and off (my worry is some kind of a secondary coughing headache). So, we contacted my fianc\'s physician again and he suggested that my fianc get a CT scan and more bloodwork and visit with a pulmonary specialist; we got the CT scan and went to the specialist. The CT scan came back completely clean as well as his bloodwork. Everything was 100% normal, except for my fianc\'s cough. It is persistent and severe; he can hardly speak a full sentence before coughing again and regularly gets bad coughing attacks. At this point, the pulmonologist strongly suggested that my fianc be admitted to the hospital for more testing and intensive treatment in a controlled setting (just in case he had a bad reaction to anything).\n\nNow, we\'re into the second day of my fianc being in the hospital. Day 1, they gave him another course of azithromycin and a steroid (I can\'t recall the name, but it was not prednisone). They did a chest x-ray (came back clear), more bloodwork (came back completely normal), and a COVID test (negative). He did not improve at all in terms of his cough (even with codeine--it seems to have no effect at all on his cough); it\'s a persistent, nagging, kind of hacking cough, that\'s sometimes productive, sometimes not. On Day 1, my fianc also had blood drawn for a pertussis test (I had been wondering if it might be whooping cough and I was relieved that they were finally testing for it). Now, on to Day 2; my fianc is now on a different course of antibiotics and a stronger steroid (I\'m forgetting both names--I\'ll double check). He\'s injected with this steroid once every 8 hours. They also did a respiratory panel today and took a sample/swab similar to the COVID test (i.e., nasopharyngeal swab from way up the nose); those results came back totally clear, no microbes detected (so, our doctor told us that pertussis is not the cause of my fianc\'s coughing--I remain skeptical). And that\'s where we\'re at right now. Still, my fianc isn\'t showing any signs of improvement, even after the new course of antibiotics and steroids today. NOTE: The only time that he DOES NOT cough is when he is sleeping. Once he\'s asleep, out is out like a light and he isn\'t disturbed in his sleep by coughing attacks.\n\nSo, any thoughts or suggestions? I\'m totally at a loss. The only thing I can think of is perhaps some kind of environmental contaminant or exposure to something. My fianc, as I mentioned, does work in a warehouse (although, he\'s been excused from work for the last 6 weeks since he started coughing). Mainly, he packs pallets and moves them around with a forklift. On occasion, he sometimes has to pack pallets with boxes from a hazardous materials room or an aerosols room; but, those materials are always sealed and packed carefully. I just wonder if he was maybe exposed to some kind of an aerosol or some other substance or dust or residue... But, the symptoms don\'t completely line-up. My fianc has severe coughing, and although coughing is a symptom associated with being exposed to some kind of a substance in a workplace, it is typically a part of other symptoms with occupational asthma. My fianc doesn\'t have any asthma symptoms; he can breathe fine, but the coughing can cause him to have trouble breathing when he has a coughing attack. My fianc has two different inhalers that he was prescribed when the coughing started (a typical albuterol inhaler--which doesn\'t help him at all--and a symbicort inhaler--which provides very mild and temporary relief, if any). I was thinking it was pertussis at first; my fianc last had a Tdap shot in 2013 or 2014 (he couldn\'t remember for sure) and although it is relatively recent, that vaccination does lose some potency over time. Although the respiratory panel that my fianc had yesterday came back negative, I wonder what the blood test for pertussis will come back as. Anyway, I have no idea what is going on with my fianc and the doctors seem equally confused and at a loss. Steroids, antibiotics--nothing is having any kind of effect or relief and I\'m getting a little desperate for answers. I appreciate any help! Thank you!'"
NSAID constipation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/12yy1kb/sciatica_meralgia_paresthetica_both/,b'Sciatica? Meralgia paresthetica? Both?',,"b'So my long story. Back in 2006/7 I started noticing an ""odd"" sensation in my lower outer thigh about 3"" above and to the left of my left knee when I exercised. Hard to explain. Not painful, not burning, just...odd feeling. I had some mild back and hip pain here and there. At the time I just attributed it to doing something wrong while I was working out and tried to be more careful. As time went on, the odd feeling started turning into numbness when I lay down and more pain/pressure in my lower back and hips. \n\nI finally went to a Dr about it in 2014 when it started becoming more than irritating and the area had gone from just a small area to the entire outer thigh. Laying down would make my thigh on icy/hot fire and pins and needles. It was pretty painful but nothing like I\'ve experienced over the past few years. Dr ordered an x-ray and said I had some mild arthritis that might be pressing a nerve when I lay down, mentioned the meralgia paresthetica, said to take nsaids, and to lose weight. \n\nFast forward through 9 years of it only getting worse and worse as I was dealing with other pressing health issues (and surgeries). At times it can feel like someone is hacking into my thigh with a lightning bolt- 10/10 pain when it happens. True agony. I feel paralyzed by the pain as even the tiniest of movements will make the thigh slashing feeling even worse. I literally move millimeter by millimeter until I get to a position that takes pressure off. Standing almost instantly makes my whole leg numb to my toes. Sitting slowly makes my leg numb. Sometimes I get numb walking. Pressing on the area is *very* painful. Sometimes the lightest touch will elicit the most pain. I used to get some relief from doing exercise/stretches like pelvic tilt, cat camel poses, leg to chest (and many other recommended ones) but they just haven\'t worked in quite some time. My back and my hips hurt, but I\'d rather have the back pain than the thigh pain. I\'d say back and hips are a constant 3-4 pain but can be bad if I bend over and/or stand up the wrong way. \n\n\nI finally got some sick time built up and saw a new PCP in March. She did some tests in the office and says I have bilateral sciatica, gave me Prednisone and muscle relaxers (relief was minimal), ordered an x-ray and EMG NCV, and referred me to Ortho. X-ray shows ""mild arthritic changes"" and EMG NCV show nerve entrapment in ankle. Ortho reviewed for tests, confirmed the bilateral sciatica, added si joint dysfunction, and ordered an MRI, which I have this Friday. She also mentioned cause for cauda equina when I mentioned my lifelong issues with constipation and some urinary issues but I don\'t think this is that. Neither mentioned meralgia paresthetica. \n\n\nI\'ve Dr googled both and feel like it could be both. Or started as MP then sciatica developed from something else. Does anyone have both? Will the MRI show anything about an entrapped femoral nerve? My biggest fear through all of this is my MRI being clear and told to just do pt. I\'m broke. I have insurance but it\'s still $40 a visit. And time. I just don\'t have it. I am diligent about doing stretches and exercises at home--Ortho approved, and they gave me free access to an approved pt video program. \n\n\nIf you\'re still here, thanks for reading!'"

If you\'re young, athletic and motivated like me, it really takes a toll on you. \n\nI know exactly how HORRIBLE this feels and this is why I\'m writing this. \n\nIf a single person reads my success story and feels a bit better, then I will be happy. \n\n**This is not medical advice**. \n\nI will describe my own experience in length, what worked and what didn\'t, but I am not a doctor. Beware: Back pain and sciatica are large industries. There are NUMEROUS vultures willing to suck your wallet dry while wasting your time with treatments that do you no good, or worse, cause you harm. It is highly likely that you will be required to dodge a number of such bullshit-fused bullets before you\'re completely healed. \n\nYeap. I said it. Completely healed. You WILL be completely healed.\n\nI did, and you will too. \n\n**Here\'s my story:**\n\nAugust 3rd, 2017 I injured my back deadlifting on the gym. I was pretty strong, back then, and I felt like I was Superman. I had been dealing with minor lower-back injuries - many family members do - since middle-school, so I didn\'t sweat it. \n\nI was back in the gym two days later trying to push through the pain and working out as normal.\n\n**Lesson 1:** \n\nDon\'t be dumb, like I was. If you\'re injured, let it heal. \n\nI am pretty confident that THIS was the day I fucked up my spine, and not the day I deadlifted. This has been confirmed by a physical therapist and two orthopedics. \n\n**I repeat: If you\'re injured, let it heal. Listen to your body.** \n\nSo, my lower back balooned with inflammation. After four days or so, my left leg started going numb. Numbness quickly devolved to pain. EXCRUCIATING pain. The type of pain that turns Superman to a crying, malnourished, lost 9-year old girl. The type of pain that haunts you for months after. \n\nI was literally carried to the Emergency Department of a hospital, where they prescribed me Arcoxia & Norgesic (potent anti-inflammatory and muscle-relaxant/painkiller respectively). \n\n**I passed out at 11 am next morning. Didn\'t sleep a minute through that first night.** \n\nFast forward a few days, a neurosurgeon I was sent to pointed out I had: \n\n*  Significant muscle weakness on my lower leg. \n\n*  Loss of sensation to a big portion of my foot.\n\n* The usual neurological suspects: Tingling, needless, cramps and the like. \n\nHe told me I\'d probably need surgery or I\'d risk permanent damage, and he prescribed me an MRI. \n\nThe MRI showed I had 2 two minor disc herniations and a third one, which had f***ing exploded. A big portion of disc ""gel"" had been ruptured off and was fixed on pressing my sciatic nerve. \n\nI was given methylprednisolone (corticosteroid) and told I should have surgery soon because that would NOT heal through conservative treatment - to do otherwise would risk permanent damage. \n\n**Well, let me tell you, this was inaccurate. I healed.** \n\nI decided not to undergo surgery after fact-gathering and lengthy personal research. I learned three things:\n\n*  Over the long-term patients that have been operated on and those who opted for conservative treatment have, on average, the same level of healing. \n\n* Huge disc injuries, like mine, were FULLY capable of resolving themselves much like the smaller ones. This is called disc-resorption, for anyone that is interested. \n\n* Each spinal surgery increases the risk of future surgeries. Given my age, I was pretty much guaranteed to have fusion surgery down the road - which is not really on my menu. \n\n**So, what did I do?**\n\nI visited NUMEROUS other doctors and health experts. Now, I have to be honest with you. I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the health-care industry. 9 out of 10 people don\'t give a shit about your health. \n\nI will give you three examples that highlight my horrendous experience: \n\n1.  A physical therapist I visited accidentally re-injured me with his elbow during manual therapy. He told me that it was somehow my fault, and he had nothing to do with it. I was in bed for around 2 weeks due to this.\n\n2.  An orthopedic told me I should get vitamin B-complex injections. These are supposed to help with nerve damage repair. Well, they only work if you\'re deficient. I was not. In fact, after getting blood work done, I saw I was above-limit. \n\n3.  A quack told me I should do his few, magic ""healing stretches"" that would ""re-align"" my life. Needless to say, mere stretching was not the answer - I will get into that later - and his stretches had nothing unique about them. \n\nI am getting carried away. \n\nSo, after spending MONTHS pursuing shitty hit-and-miss treatments, this is what actually worked for me:\n\n**From pain-management to functionality:**\n\n**1. Walking:** I set a goal to walk 5 miles per day. At first, walking was limited inside my home but I slowly built on it, dilligently. \n\n**2. Sciatic nerve gliding:** Youtube that shit. There is not strong medical evidence, but it helped me. It might help you. \n\n**3. McGills Big 3:** Google them up. I know enough about fitness to understand how to intelligently progress these into harder versions. I would slowly increase difficulty every third day. \n\n**4. Vitamin C & D:** 2000 MG & 3000 UV daily respectively. Might have been placebo. I saw a few studies claiming these help, they were cheap, so I tried them. \n\n(*Only after significant discomfort had passed*):\n\n**5. Daily stretching:** I stretched my calfs, my soleus (look it up), my hamstrings (bent leg), my quads (important), my glutes (piriformis too), my hip flexors. I would also do the McKenzie spinal stretch. \n\n**6. Strengthening all the aforementioned muscles.** LIGHT exercise - all following well-structured protocols. I found the site sportsinjuryclinic a great resource in this. I found treatment protocols for EACH problem-area I had and followed them like a zealot - e.g, achiles tendon rehab, hamstring sprain rehab etc. Of special importance, I found, was strengthening the gluteus medius muscle - google up the exercise ""clams"". \n\n**7. Progressing to harder core exercises.** Ab wheel, leg raises on the pull-up bar. Being more active - i.d, more walking, light upper body work. \n\n**Now, let me share the things that f*d me up:**\n\n**1. Pressure on my nerve.** Whether it was manual therapy, tight jeans, sitting on an uncomfortable chair, too much exercise, streching too much, my foam roller - or, in cases where I was really vulnerable, merely walking - this lead to complications. I\'d usually start going numb and hurting. DON\'T overdo it, whatever it is you are doing.\n\n**2. Cold.** It\'s pretty cold where I live. I\'ve noticed this to have a significant effect on my sciatic symptoms. Try and stay warm, whenever you can. \n\n**3. Too much medicine.** Did nothing, or worse, it masked my condition by covering the symptoms. This lead me to overestimate my health and complicated the situation numerous times. Use it when you need it. \n\n**4. Laying on bed.** I\'ve experienced SIGNIFICANT muscle atrophy on my legs throughout this journey. I attribute this to the fact that I spent too much time laying in bed, during periods of great fear and discomfort. Fear is your biggest enemy in this, I swear. Stay as active as possible without hurting yourself. This is a fine line, but you can find it if you go looking for it. \n\n**5. Dr. Sarno\'s preachings** - and any other feel-good goofy mental treatment. Now, I am a logical person by nature. This might work better for you if you\'re emotional, but I wouldn\'t bet on it. Although I imagine there is a psychosomatic component in this, trying to address this mentally did not work for me. If anything, it got me overthinking and paranoid. \n\n**6. Overexerting myself.** For a length of time, I tried to keep working on full capacity as best as I could. This stressed me in ways that you can not imagine. You need to realize that for a few months you\'ll be in a healing phase. For good or worse, you need to minimize your responsibilities. This is especially important if you\'re a workaholic. \n\n------------\n\n**The million-dollar question: How do I feel now?**\n\nI had a second MRI recently. \n\nMy ""exploded"" disc gel has been diminished, no longer applying pressure to my spine. \n\nI can work. I can have sex. I can go for a walk without being afraid. I am not yet confident I can weightlift heavy or throw my girlfriend around, but I am confident that I soon will.\n\nOh. And since I mentioned my girlfriend, let me say this because it NEEDS to be stated:\n\n**During your healing phase, surround yourself with people who love you.**\n\nI can\'t stress how valuable my girlfriend\'s presence through all this was.\n\nI am convinced I would had grown crazy without her. \n\nAnyway.\n\nThat was my story. Excuse me if the text is too long, or somewhat incoherent - it really shouldn\'t, because I am a copywriter. \n\nThe point I\'m trying to get across is simple:\n\nIf my dumb ass managed to heal, then you can too. I promise you. There\'s hope.\n\n**Stay strong, brothers and sisters.**\n\nBest wishes,\n\nItchesForRiches\n\n\n'"

I am 25F, I was prescribed Spirinolactone 25mg 3 months ago for acne. My derm didnt give me any warnings about it besides it makes you pee a lot, which was true for me. Last week my dosage was upped to 75 mg because I wasnt seeing results. I also noticed since I began taking this my period has been out of whack. Longer than usual, starting sooner each month, and this month and yesterday in particular my period was very light and almost non existent which is strange for me. I didnt think too much of it, but last night I woke up late to go pee at around 2am, and as I went there was the Niagara Falls of blood I usually expect during my cycle. I went back to my night stand to take some advil and next thing I know Im so dizzy I cant see, and I fainted straight backwards. I came too with my fianc shaking me awake and my whole body tingly, I felt empty inside and like I was drunk or drugged and tripping out. I then had to run to the bathroom and was having terrible period cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting all at the same time. I started panicing and was crying in pain so after I tried to calm down in a cold shower we went to the ER. The cause of all of this mess was the Spirinolactone causing me to have to extreme low blood pressure and low sodium levels and extreme dehydration that has been happening for 3 months. I will never be taking this medicine again even if it means I have to deal with acne. All this to say do your research and ask your derm questions because I didnt. If a medicine is made for people with high blood pressure it probably shouldnt be handed out to people suffering with acne like candy the way it is!!!'"

I have X-rays from before and after extraction available if youd like to see them.\n\nHello, I got all 4 impacted wisdom teeth removed last Wednesday morning. The top two wisdom teeth were impacted but nothing was terribly amiss with them. The bottom right was impacted and completely horizontal with the top of it facing outward in my mouth while the bottom left was impacted and the roots were very close to a nerve (surgeon said he was able to remove the roots no problem despite this). I was in normal expected pain for several days taking my antibiotic/800mg ibuprofen/acetaminophen-codeine #3. However on Saturday morning I was in such excruciating pain (acetaminophen-codeine #3 AND old non-expired prescribed Norco from my kidney stones did NOTHING to help) I ended up passing out because of it.\nThen things seemed to turn a corner and I was able to manage my pain with just the ibuprofen until Sunday night/early Monday morning when the excruciating pain came back. My mom called the oral surgeon who told me to take 1000mg Tylenol followed by 800mg ibuprofen two hours later (it made me fall asleep and I woke up feeling much better). The excruciating pain came back later that night and the same regimen did nothing to help. Met with oral surgeon the next morning who took another X-ray, removed sutures, said I had no infection/no dry socket and I was almost completely healed with minimal inflammation. He thought by the way I was grabbing my face in pain/crying that it was muscle spasms so he prescribed 10 10mg Valium and told me to continue the Tylenol/ibuprofen regimen with moist heat no ice. He said if that doesnt work after a week he has no idea how to help me. Took Valium/Tylenol an hour later and after an hour passed out. Eventually woke up later feeling amazing until the excruciating pain came back several hours later.\nThe excruciating pain that makes me wish I was dead (not actually but you know what I mean) still happens after the Valium wears off/every time I wake up and Im beginning to lose hope that this pain will ever go away. Valium no longer makes me fall asleep (just dizzy) and still leaves some pain that is constant but manageable.\nI can barely open my mouth enough to stick two fingers in vertically without sharp pain in the spot my upper and lower jaw meet. Pain is sharp from temple/ears all the way down lower jaw to my chin on both sides and there is a deep ache in my lower teeth/gums/down the front of my neck/behind my eyes. Lymph nodes in neck are extremely swollen still. I have the taste/sensation of blood in the back of my mouth too but no apparent bleeding.\n\nDoes anyone know if this really might be muscle spasms and if so how long I should take the Valium before the spasms stop completely (days/weeks/etc)? Or is there anything else that could be causing this incredibly debilitating pain? It feels worse than my kidney stones and I wish I never had this surgery. I apologize for the long post, I just have a lot of anxiety around this.'"

I\'ve been dismissed by my dentist for, in my opinion, advocating for myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\'m sorry it\'s such a long ride. The events below take place over about ten months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn February, I broke a tooth. I have a military service related back injury, and I collapsed on the floor one morning when a disc ruptured. I clenched my jaw so hard in reaction to the pain that I cracked a molar.\n\nI was in a great deal of pain and taking massive amounts of NSAIDs as well as prescribed hydrocodone. I did not notice any dental pain at the time. For this reason I scheduled a non-emergency appointment. Nonetheless, simply because it\'s excruciating just to walk to the bathroom, in a sense, I make all of my healthcare decisions under duress and am not always the best conversation partner. I explained this, and all of the following, to my dentist and his office staff, and I am certain that they understood what I was telling them.\n\nOver several visits it was established that I would need a root canal and crown. I explained that due to my unique work situation I was very strapped for cash and had just terrible insurance, performance-wise; and would need to be especially prepared for the financial side. He was very helpful, and he showed me how the procedures were billed and exactly what his office charges so that I would know within reasonable limits, barring complications, what I\'d be spending.\n\nWe discussed it at length; and how my insurance company would not pay for a root canal and a crown at the same time; and how if I was willing to play what sounded like a dangerous dance with infection I could do what many of his patients do, get the canal today and fill it, then get the crown next insurance year. But given how terrible my insurance is and how broke I am, I told him getting it extracted was my most realistic option.\n\nHe doesn\'t do extractions. He referred me to another doctor. That doctor was on vacation, so my appointment was scheduled over a month out.\n\nSome time later I got a fever, woke up drenched in sweat, and convinced I had COVID, called into work. The covid test was negative so I assumed it was the flu. My health worsened over the next few days until I was experiencing mental confusion and bizarre thoughts; and it suddenly occurred to me that my tooth (which still had not given me any pain at all) could be infected. This was confirmed by an emergency dentist, who pulled the tooth and prescribed antibiotics.\n\nEverything got better except for my job, which I lost due to the excessive sick time.\n\nBut the emergency dentist knocked out a crown that my regular dentist had made. They reattached it but advised me that without the extracted tooth, things may shift and if the bite was off I should go get it reseated.\n\nAfter all of this... the insurance company screwed it up anyway. And for whatever reason, it was nearly seven months before I found out I still owed the dentist a trivial amount (around $100). I received a ""final notice"" that I discovered in my mailbox on the way home from work. Since I live blocks away, I just got back in the car and walked into the office to pay the bill.\n\n(Bear in mind that I mean trivial *to a dentist*. To me, it means doing without something.)\n\nWhile I was there, I explained that I had not received any prior invoices, and that last I had spoken with the insurance company, it had been my understanding that the insurance claim was still being processed. I also re-iterated how distressing the entire incident had been very distressing to me how I thought I\'d done everything I could to prepare for the expense.\n\nThey can always call me on the phone. I live a block away. The dentist told me twice that *I* can always call *his* phone. Resorting to threatening my credit score is kinda bringing a gun to a fistfight, isn\'t it?\n\nWhile I was there, I said ""I don\'t think I\'m the first person who\'s had a surprise bill,"" to which the receptionist replied, ""no, you\'re not, and you won\'t be the last.""\n\nI said, ""but don\'t you want better?""\n\nShe seemed offended and said, ""excuse me?"" and I did feel bad about that so I clarified, ""I mean, don\'t you want for there to be no patients with billing problems?"" She said ""yes,"" and I tried to reiterate how frustrated it can be to deal with this kind of stuff while in pain. I apologized for ""wrecking their afternoons,"" or something to that effect, and I added ""but please try to understand it\'s wrecking my entire year and still isn\'t over."" I thought they understood and sympathized with me. I even vaguely recall being assured I hadn\'t offended anyone. I later came to gravely regret not recording the conversation myself.\n\n*and on an aside, I honestly do believe that if we all work together there are ways that we can build relationships with our medical providers; and it\'s not in everyone\'s best interests to simply ""do what the computer and policy manual say to do."" Maybe I\'d have explained that more eloquently if I wasn\'t always thinking about whether tonight\'s the night I blow my brains out because I ran out of vicodin.*\n\nMeanwhile I had developed pain in another tooth and because my dentist typically has very long appointment waits I called another nearby dentist who was able to see me that day. His assessment was that the original crown was compromised and that it needed to be replaced. He advised me, however, that it might be possible to remove adhesive and reinstall it without spending $2000, so I should call the dentist who installed it.\n\nThis morning, a number of months after the above took place, I called my dentist to schedule an appointment for the damaged crown. I was put on hold for a few minutes, and the receptionist came back and informed me that I\'d been dismissed as a patient. I asked why, and was told several things:\n\n* The doctor stated that I was ""angry at having to pay my bill""\n* The doctor stated that I ""became irate.""\n* I was being disrespectful to the office personnel.\n\nI then asked if the doctor had stated that I\'d raised my voice, or had used any specific or offensive language, to which the receptionist replied, ""any dentist is permitted to dismiss any patient for any reason?""\n\nI admit this kind of shocked me, and I did say one or two snarky comebacks, such as, ""do you encounter many people who are angry they have to pay their bill?"" and, ""does \\[dismissing patients for any reason\\] sound like good/professional business practice to you?"" But then I pointed out that there were two people in the office at the time, neither of whom was the doctor; and I asked if anyone who was present could comment on my conduct. The other party told me that they were one of those two people, assured me that they had not interacted with me (I distinctly remember making eye contact and thanking them for their patience), and said that they agreed I had been disrespectful and irate. I asked why neither of them had said anything at the time, and the reply I got was, ""I\'m not going to go around in circles on this. A dentist can dismiss you for any reason.""\n\nThey also reminded me multiple times of the ""late"" bill that I paid, in person, within minutes of receiving in my mailbox.\n\nI am also pursuing a registered professional career (engineering). A false record of my conduct stands in my dentist\'s office, which will one day be purchased by a conglomerate and integrated with their database, and I have, at least within a narrow professional sphere, been slandered. But worse yet, I can\'t get my teeth fixed. But underneath it all, it really feels like dismissing patients for systemic problems like billing delays is a very handy way for dentists and doctors to get rid of ""problem patients.""\n\nLet me reiterate that while I am kind of a tough looking guy with a very deep voice, at *no* time did I *raise* my voice or behave in a way that even approaches the definition of ""irate."" I am an engineer with two years experience dealing with ""irate"" buyers chewing me out about supply-chain-related shipment delays.  You can\'t keep the pedal to the floor 100% of the time.\n\nAlso: why was I dismissed today, while making an appointment, and not months ago when I was allegedly being ""irate""?\n\nSo esteemed dentists of Reddit, was my dentist\'s conduct appropriate? Was he fair and respectful? Does this warrant a complaint to the NYS Office of Professional Discipline?\n\nOr AITA for what I thought was doing my best to advocate for myself?\n\nThird option (sorry for all the edits. I am honestly a little upset over this. He\'s a good dentist): is there any way I can work this out with him? I honestly do not think this is an option given how I was treated by his office staff. I don\'t think it would be fair to force them to deal with me now that they\'ve made their opinions clear to me.'"
Advil eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/13q749c/rct_and_crown_on_cracked_tooth/,b'RCT and crown on cracked tooth',,"b'Hi there, Ill keep this long story brief. Unfortunately I have no x-rays. \n\nMy dentist noticed a cracked molar (#31). I had no symptoms. Dentist did crown. Temp went fine, got permanent cemented 1 week later. Two weeks later I started to feel dull ache when eating, stiff jaw, pain radiating from tooth/ear/etc. Went back to dentist and they recommended Endo. Went to Endo who said no infection was visible yet but there was a small spot and widening canal. Endo did RCT through the perm crown and completed with permanent filling. Healing for first week was great. Now its two weeks out and Im getting the same jaw pain, with a bit less pain in the tooth than before, but same pain radiating up the jaw and down neck. Pain is not severe, can ignore it. Havent taken advil to treat yet. The pain is worse at night after chewing and talking all day. Some days I dont feel anything, sometimes it comes for an hour or two. Ive noticed sensitivity all around my mouth since the RCT. \n\nContext: I grind a lot and have TMJ. Thats how I cracked my molar. I wear a night guard that is ill-fitting (waiting for replacement) but I figure its better than nothing. Endo could not see crack on normal or fancy x-ray. Made no comment about crack when going through the crown for RCT. In his eyes the RCT was successful. Two different dentists tested for VRF, and found everything normal. \n\nShould I be concerned? Can TMJ prolong root canal healing? Is it possible re-infection? Im ready for the saga to end and feeling so much anxiety.'"

In sets of bigeminy and trigeminy. I went to the doctor and got an ekg that was normal and a cbc w/diff cholesterol, ect. Albumin was 5.5 (.3 over) and calcium was .2 over but doctor didnt mention it to me. He said everything was good. He also wrote me off hard as just having anxiety. All in my head \n\nCalcium rechecks were 10.2, 10.6, 10.4 \n(Ref range was 10.3)\n\nMy thyroid was within range but at 0.53 TSH and 1.7 T4\n\nI went to cardiologist. He did echo, carotid ultrasound, EKG, week monitor, and chest ct without contrast, no valve regurg, everything on CT was unremarkable or no lesions present (aorta, upper abdomen, lungs, bones) BUT he saw heterogenous thyroid. Went for US and they found about nine nodules. Recommended biopsy for one due to size but endo says he believes its a cyst but did FNA due to size. Waiting on that. He also did a series of blood tests and noticed I had low vitamin D but said because of my tsh/t4 being normal and my PTH and phosphorus being normal he doesnt think thyroid is causing symptoms. (I thought maybe I had hyperthyroidism)\n\n\nHeres where it gets a little weird on two accounts:\n\nPart 1:\nIm not a conspiracy theorist in anyway, but all this started happening after my second Covid shot. So that was one theory I had that maybe Im just one of the unlucky few. I had Covid too (before the shots) but besides a cough and the worlds worst headache I was pretty okay. \n\nI got the shot in June and symptoms started late June early July. \n\nHeres where its weird part 2: \nI was never tested for STDs even though I thought I was. I thought my doctor screened me at every blood test. Im also not sexually active outside of relationships but I had an ex (10 years ago) who REALLY wasnt honest and I got a pretty weird sore throat that made my tonsils touch while dating her, responded to cefixime, not to zpack, my mom took me to hospital and they thought I had mono and shot me with steroids. Which made me WORSE. I told them no way cuz antibiotics were working. Turns out I didnt have mono (did have igg for ebv though) after the steroids I had a peeling hand rash like blisters and really bad mouth pain that I assumed was a side effect of IV methyl prednisone. When I saw my PCP after he said Its not mono we checked you for everything its probably a virus to which I also disagreed but I was 22 at the time. Also when he said everything, I thought he meant stds too. It took me a while to feel better/tonsils to go down.  \n\nSo now ten years later, I freaked about the symptoms I had back then(hand rash, mouth pain, sore throat, and I had dry flaky skin around genitalia and a raised round rash/welt on side of scrotum at the time that I thought was eczema or jock itch) and ran to an ID doctor cuz I thought it could have been syphilis. He did full panel negative for all STIs twice just to make sure  (didnt test for herpes) Including FTA ABS, then he did a TPPA I had two rpr and also two reverse screens (one from labcorp one from quest) all now (ten years later, not back then) that Im worried are pulling false negatives due to length of time/waning antibodies and the fact that I basically was drinking heavily out of anxiety during those months October to December. Im talking like four or five drinks a day sometimes (I would stop a day or two before the tests, but I drank whiskey the day before the FTA ABS test) Im worried the antigen specific antibodies went down. ID doctor wouldnt treat me unless I came back positive.\n\nSwitched PCPs, this one heard me out a little better and prescribed me doxy 100mg x 2 for 28 days because he could see I was visibly worried. (No penicillin allergy but he didnt want to give me the shot yet since I keep testing negative and maybe it is something else) so I cut the drinking out since I started the doxy (I had like one beer that I split in half, and another day I had a little glass of sake but Im abstaining for the doxy to really work)\nHe did urine culture and dipstick test both normal. (No microanalysis)\n\nEye pain stopped after doxy I noticed, also high albumin dropped from 5.5 to 4.8\n\nOn one hand im worried Im having some wild vaccine reaction\n\non the other hand, Im worried I might have syphilis/neurosyphilis from ten years ago which is causing the eye pain, floaters, twitching, ect. I hope god forbid the doxy would be enough to stop further damage. \n\nIf not that, then maybe some other bacterial infection that wasnt treated right. Or Covid/Covid shot side effects.\n\nCould the alcohol really have messed my std tests up/ should I retest after the doxy/a month of not drinking\n\nCan anyone recommend any other tests or something else to look into. I just want to feel normal again and Im scared'"

This post contains mentions of mensuration, suicidal thoughts, overdose mentions and and s/h mentions \n\nA few years back I started experiencing delayed periods, ex: getting it in March then not getting it again till May. When this started happening I got bad cramps and nauseous feelings when standing and it got to the point where I couldnt stand without feeling like wanting to puke. One time my parents wanted me to clean despite my terrible pain and I told them and they didnt listen to me. When I kept complaining about the pain and not being able to stand for long periods of time without throwing up my mom got mad at me. She told me to just Take a pill and if you take a pill it will go away. Now I get very anxious when taking pills (I think I may have a anxiety disorder but not the point) and I refused. My mom suddenly gotten angry and yelled at me that the world didnt revolve around me and that the world wouldnt stop just because I got my period. Obviously I got overwhelmed and started crying which seemed to just piss my mom off even more. Now I have a hand stim that I use to calm myself down that I do get made fun of at home for doing and I started to aggressively stim trying to calm myself. They crushed up the pill and told me to take it. I took it and went to bed crying my eyes out feeling like I was worth nothing. I have very bad self worth issues and I believe that was the start of the decline of my mental health. I still remember it and it makes me terrified to think of it. (This is where the more mental health starts to take place)\n\nNow this is the major tw for attempted overdose, s/h thoughts, and suicidal thoughts if you are sensitive about the subject please stop reading.\nRecently due to quarantine my mental health has been on a decline. My parents have been fighting more and my dad seems to sometimes not like me for my inability to hear him (I have some sort of ear problem that makes it hard to hear out of one ear and its hard for me to hear which I have informed them of). Because of these fights my suicidal thoughts started to get worse then the usual one time thing I got. One day in the middle of online class my parents had left home and I did something that I regret now, I went to the bathroom and frantically look for Advil or something to overdose on and couldnt find any pills and returned to class like nothing happened. I havent told anyone about this, and more things have happened since then like me running knifes down my arms not cutting but borderline being s/h. I know my parents fighting and my moms hard words are the reasons my mental health has declined but they are so nice to me. Im an only child and would say Im fairly spoiled by some standards (I own a switch laptop for school and a iPhone 8). I know my parents love me (or at least I hope) I am their miracle baby and know they care about me. I know my mom and dad love me but they are also the reason my mental health is shit and I dont know how to feel about them. Reddit please tell me should I be upset at my parents for destroying my mental health when they didnt mean to? Or am I just being sensitive and should get over the past.'"

Things got better, Then worse, then better, and now worse again. I\'ve been out of work for almost a year now, and on disability again. Recently was diagnosed with unspecified bipolar, gad, with borderline personality traits, and a bunch of other pretty shitty things, including substance abuse. I also have a genetic disorder called ehlers danlos, which I believe led to negative psychological manifestations, in addition to physical dependencies I\'ve developed trying to self medicate with OTC codeine and alcohol. I\'ve ended up isolating myself for the past few years, and recently moved in with my girlfriend. It\'s been very challenging. Extremely challenging. She\'s also got BPD and GAD and really one of the reasons we connected was because we understood each other. Since moving in and having to face feelings, people, situations, I\'ve become face to face with my true ugly self. I\'m a selfish asshole, and I only care about me, but it\'s impossible not to when there\'s so much stimuli dancing around my mind, frustrating me, angering me, guilting me, putting me into a position of powerlessness.. and then other days I\'m cheery and the things that the other day nearly made me want to rip my own skin off, I\'ll not even bat an eye towards, going so far as to laugh. My moods go to complete shit, and I have absolutely no control over it, and it is all consuming. I am so assumptive of things, that I realize now that it seems like it almost borders on paranoia. The situations I\'ve caught myself in, only to feel like a total and complete utter jackass in the end when I\'m proven wrong, are too numerous and embarrassing to detail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy gf and I are in a real bad place right now. Ive had arguments about her doing nothing to better herself, yet here I am 3 months in and still refusing pharmacological help. Still doing nothing myself. Still literally sitting still, still hanging onto the hope that my poor coping techniques will one day magically just start to work. I\'m at a point where I realize that for therapies and counselling to be effective that I need to be medicated, because I get nowhere where I am. The all consuming pessimist in me knows that it\'ll fail once again, so let\'s not bother. Everything \\*\\*always\\*\\* falls apart, no matter how good it seems and no matter if I\'ve manged it longer this time than the last. My life is miserable. I\'ve got stockholm syndrome and my captor is my own self.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\'m so fucking scared to try this medication though. I\'ve never had anything beyond ssri\'s and wellbutrin (which didnt work out too well). These classes of drugs scare me. I don\'t want to be a drone. I like my happy two or three days every couple months - or do I really? Maybe being content and mostly happy the majority of the time is better. I don\'t know. See, I\'m already assuming I know exactly how this is going to work out when in reality, I don\'t have a fucking clue. It could be a god send, it could not work anything like I imagine, I could end up with a life long debilitating condition as a result, who knows, I gotta try it right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy am I so fucking scared to have the life I deserve?'"
penicillin eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/fkz73y/a_narrative_on_suicide_and_mental_health_txt/,b'A narrative on suicide and mental health (txt)',,"b'My Blue Monday\n\nMy blue Monday came early this year. The day where everyone quits their jobs or offs themselves (and not how does it feel to treat me like you do ). I was one of them. Off-ing myself, not leaving a job as Im immersed in student-hood once again at the ripe age of 34. I spent the day ejecting, self destructing, clearing the cobwebs of niceties from my mind, being a rude shit to my friends, slamming the proverbial door in their faces and doing all I could to shut out the light from the world. God knows, I am tired of the light.\n\nAll of my sins, my self hatred, my disgust, lay before me. No room on the table for anything good. Positivity, the coward in the gloom at the back of my mind, buried deep in the pain and the fire of depression.\n\nAbout depression: it is a shadow. A shadow that is measured not in metres but in years, always following, always there, attached at my feet under every step. It waxes and wanes with the intensity of light cast upon it, and that depends on those complicated chemical reactions in my brain which control how far the shutter blinds open and how much light creeps into the room. Those reactions have been out of balance since I was born and tonight, I wish more than ever that I hadnt been.\n\nMy thoughts of those who love me are too far away to call to mind. Nothing feels real or tangible right now. I am watching this play out behind a glass screen like some petulant child glued to a TV. The medication I am on is successful in removing my crippling anxiety and has allowed that un-watched pot boiling on the gas stove to spit and bubble over. Sadly, the medication doesnt touch the sides when it comes to my other issues. Its like taking morphine for a broken leg, in that you no longer feel the pain but you can sure as hell run a marathon and do yourself ten-times the damage. You dont notice until youve crossed the finish line and can see the bone sticking right through the flesh. These issues are an unchained guard dog roaming free in the yard, foaming at the mouth and baring teeth. But now the gate is open and its free to mingle with the hopes and dreams and intricate nuances of everyday life.\n\nAnd so that pot boils over. The insurmountable weight of gravity sucks the water down the side of the pan into the gas flame and it vapourises instantly. I am raging now, I cannot see though my eyes are open. That proverbial TV is at the other side of the room, my life beyond it, and I am being dragged backward across the carpet. My hands are shaking and the skin on my chest is tighter than a tribal drum as if it will somehow burst wide open and the sheer might of my anger will spill out into the room, laying waste to all it touches.\n\nSo I drink to numb the pain. I drink to stay the demons, to feel anything else but me for just one tiny, little, second. I drink so I can breathe and have the feeling of air in my lungs overtake the wrenching ache. One. Two. Three beers, that half a bottle of whisky from the cupboard, the white wine on the side  I drink it room temperature. It all goes straight down. Sweet poison. All within an hour or so. But the solace it brings is short lived, the calm before the storm. The metabolism of the alcohol somehow, unsurprisingly, exacerbates the whirlwind in my brain. Its the perfect storm and I am lost at sea.\n\nMAKE.\nIT.\nSTOP.\n\nIts been about 20 years since I last tied a noose, Google refreshes my memory and I laugh defiantly at the large banners on every instructional website that state if youre considering tying a noose because youre having suicidal thoughts and need immediate help coping, please call emergency services such as 911 or 999 or a suicide hotline. Glossed over in my drunken stupor. I tie it anyway. The NHS Crisis Team hotline number saved in my phone is the friend Ive lost touch with and feel weird about calling. So I dont.\n\nMy flat has no stairs, the common hallway is secluded but its still public, same as the balcony. I need privacy, no one to stop and look on, to find me, to film it on their phones for their vacuous, self-absorbed Instagram or YouTube fiction. I want silence. Peace. Finally.\n\nI go to the exercise tower in my bedroom. The tower that Ive used to keep my body trim and my mind sharp, that Ive used to fight through the darkness when times were hard. The tower that will be the last thing I cling to on this earth. I secure the rope to the top hand holds with a round turn and two half-hitches. My fingers baulk at the coldness of the metal holds. The noose now swings gently and settles against the stillness of the air. I am unhappy with the resting height so I readjust the top knot. A testing tug with my hand and the rope confides in me that it can do the job.\n\nI turn, looking through the door to the living room, the magnificent vista gracing my eyes, and slip the noose over my head, the knot resting on the nape of my neck. It is as heavy as the endless night I find myself in, as heavy as my burden upon the world. No thoughts of my time and travels, my loves and achievements, those times that I have been a good person. Only this second exists, right now. Despair, loneliness. My legs slump and I feel the tightness around my neck. I give no time to thought any more, no poignant mindful farewell, no parting scribbles on a scrap of paper, no feeling anything at all other than the anger driving my body forward against the rope. I lean into it with such conviction that I fear the fibres might shred and snap as they creak like a shipyard junker tugging against the tide and the quay. But it holds firm. Each millimetre of my skin beneath the rope being crushed and chaffed and crumpled. It gives me as much slack, as much room for error, as much forgiveness as I have allowed myself in thirty-four years. My brain fizzles and static forms in the moments between what my eyes see and my brain processes. This heart in my chest accelerates its beating: I wish it had never begun to in the first place. Numbness creeps into my hands and face. I can feel my lips spitting parts of themselves out into the world as blood throbs around my body. My legs lose their will to hold my body from the floor, this burden now belongs solely to the noose. The static takes hold with a furtive permanence and I can no longer breath even the most simple molecules of air. I feel my mind flipping over to the dreamy softness of the dark, so gentle and calm against the whirring chaos of the light. Glass-like thick, black water. Moving soft and slow.\n\nIve longed to still the waters all my life. And now I am finally here, beginning to drift in that blissful sea.\n\nBut. I stop.\n\nMy legs fight again for their right to hold me, the blood throbs through thighs and skin and bone. My heart smashing its fists against the walls of my chest from deep within my muscles. I stand and my arms lift instinctively to loosen the rope that is still burning into my neck. It takes considerable effort and concentration to ease the knot. I am dizzy. I breathe deep, for only a few seconds. Why? I do not know, there is no fear here. Not any more. I want this. Still the waters. Welcome the dark.\n\nSo, I try again. I lean into the rope as hard as I can until I am losing consciousness. More this time. Take me, please take me. But the instinct in my legs betrays me once again and I stand. Fuck it. I take the noose from my neck in annoyance and anger and frustration. The moment becomes too much. I feel the worn threads of the carpet come up to meet my face. The childish red wetness of my cheeks stinging against polyester fibres of the floor covering. A cheap grave this wouldve made indeed.\n\nI am ashamed. This truly is the darkest of winters.\n\nI dont know what I was expecting. Some relief, some shining light. Some kind of cleansing. But all I am left with is me. Just me. The same me whom my friends and my family love, who wishes for only peace and love in the world. The same me who wishes to leave all that behind, to drop it where it lay and walk away, but I cant. I am still not sure what ethereal tether holds me to this earth. Some invisible force which holds its hands up to death and says No. No. Not today. Not right now. Truthfully, life just then goes on. It feels the same as its always felt. I expected some emotional recovery period but there never is one. I took my car to the garage for repairs. I met my friend for a pub lunch. I did do something differently this time, though I told my friends. I did not hide away from the light. I dont tell my parents. I still havent. They are the most wonderful people and have supported me in so many ways for which I am enternally grateful, but they are not built for this. They are not equiped to deal with me in this way and that is ok. You cannot be something youre not. I am at peace with that.\n\nI used to wonder why no one listens until youve tried to kill yourself? Is it that were just empty threats until were too much to deal with? Too real and far removed from this nice comfy bubble. Ive been told plenty of times that Im not unwell enough for support  its easy to ignore the truth if you arent listening. But, in fairness, I am a liar. A very good one. I lie to myself and everyone around me. I lie so I do not have to face the truth, so I do not have to feel anything. Life for me is the pill that catches in the throat, most of the time I choke on it until I am blue in the face. But sometimes I cough it up along with the parts of myself I cannot bear to see, spilling myself, unwelcome, out into the world. We are supposed to keep quiet, hiding some kind of taboo but its a taboo thats covered in sand, either sinking under its own weight or exposing itself to the sky like some fraud when the wind shifts. Where was my support? What do I have to do to get that? Why did I go through all of this feeling so alone? Surely the doctors attitude that teenagers often get mental health issues because they are traversing the formative years is, for the most part, complete crap. Yes, there are hormonal changes but if its that bad then isnt it because the system is broken? Is this when the creativity gets beaten out of you for good, the last smoke tails curling upwards from the dying embers of the freedom youth allows us. The finishing touches of schooling hardening the clay before that brutal injection into the veins of the working world. Keep the poison coming. Hammer in the pieces until they fit. This time its different. I am no longer prepared to lie. Not to myself. Not to those whom I love. I am trying to be honest. I am trying not to be ashamed. Ashamed to be alive, to feel emotions, to have an illness as legitimate as a broken leg or a terminal disease, or ashamed to live with my mistakes and wrongdoings. I love my friends. I am grateful for them. They have unkowingly held the broken peices of me together for so long. I know now that I have discredited them by not being honest and not telling them of my struggles. I am learning. I am not afraid to do that anymore.\n\nI am speaking now. Loud and clear. But the truth is I dont think anyone is ever really listening. I am not looking for a mountain to move or an epiphany of the masses, rushing toward me with big open arms to sweep me up with a comforting hug. I am not weak or looking for attention or someone to hold me upright as my legs give way under the weight of the world. Just someone to listen to those nuances, those tiny disturbances from tiny butterfly wings beating against the air. But the silent signals of mental illnesses too easily go unnoticed in those countless 6-minute, overworked-doctors appointments: condescending, dismissive, playing it down so they dont have to acknowledge the product of a broken society, so they dont have to deal with the ugly condition of the human mind, so perpetually dragging us down. Youre just a little sad, everybody gets sad sometimes. I dont blame them. Even the best workers in the world palm-off tasks they are not equipped to deal with, be it through exhaustion or uninterest or lack of time. So the difficulty of diagnosing something so complex in an appointment in which you only have sufficient time to sit down and remove your coat before putting it back on again and leaving with a prescription for a preferred SSRI or broad-spectrum antibiotic is not unbelievable. Quite normal, in fact. Ive palmed-off many things in my working life which I havent been equipped or bothered to deal with. So, prescribing medication to make us conform somehow  amoxicillin, penicillin, Setraline, Prozac, coffee, alcohol, consumerism, sex, its all the same. It all allows us to function when were running on empty. Save those few amazing people, friends and professionals who CAN help, this is just brushed off like a passing fly. And why wouldnt it be? We do the same to those with broken bones or cancer. Wish them well and carry on with our own lives. There is no fault there, we fill our lives with such business (busy-ness), such stress, we barely have time for ourselves, without making the time for others and their difficulties. Too much weight and you topple over. Something needs to change, somewhere. We need to stop putting sticking plasters over a gunshot wound, we need to stop the bullet being fired in the first place. Why can no one see this?\n\nAfterwards, I had a call with the Point of Entry Team within the NHS mental health services. I had the sense to realise I was in a bad way over a month before and got the GP to refer me to them (finally, a successful appointment  the squeaky wheel gets the oil, it would seem). I was brutally honest for the first time in my life about my illness, no hiding bits of me away, no shame. It was a long call but it was worth it. The psychologist was excellent. What a difficult job she does every day. One of many whom I will meet on this journey that are on the receiving end of the ramblings of broken minds each day, whom I am eternally grateful toward and for whom I have unwavering respect. We talk like friends do. We talk like people with a common goal, in search of something better from the grit and the dirt we grew up in. She tells me I have strong bipolar traits. She tells me to call the crisis team if I decide to try to take my life again. I tell her I will but I know, and she knows, that when that plane is going down it crashes quickly and sometimes you just stare at the rocks in front of you, hurtling toward your face, and you just cant think to find the parachute.\n\nStrangely, this is my break in the traffic. Allowing me to cross to a better side where I can walk in the sunshine. It feels like a cold shower waking the senses. Nothing she tells me is new but it feels good for someone give me a hand toward a proper diagnosis. Turns out Im more than just a little bit sad.\n\nThe condition: The mania I feel is like a gnat or a fly buzzing incessantly, crashing into the walls of my brain. Some days its like running through stinging nettles. Its everywhere, every inch of skin tingling. Feverish. The elation is insuppressible. I am king in my own world. I am the mighty warrior, defeating all which stands in my path. I create, seemingly endlessly, a river of ideas flowing from my mind, words falling in great torrents from my mouth. Nothing can happen quick enough. I want to run free, to wherever, no matter how far, no consequence. I will go fast and strident into the breaking day and will not slow down or cease until night, when only the body stops but the mind races on. Sleep will not grace me and when it does it is as vivid and intense as the waking day rushing past me. Everything is at warp speed. I am so agitated that I cannot sit still and the slightest inconvenience makes me feel like bursting from my clothes, Hulk-like, and smashing through the world in front of my eyes. The drugs, the sex, the rock and roll just melts into one of many blurry gaps in my memory, sloshing from side to side in the stark, disconnected hangover of a manic episode. Over time, the flip-flop of emotions continues and I begin to find calm. And for a few days after about 6-8 weeks in I am clear-headed, conscious, alert, level, what you would call NORMAL, and then the fear creeps back in like those imminent thoughts of unwanted just-watched horror movie ghosts in the dead of night. In every corner of the room, the light fading fast around you, under the bed, in the wardrobe. No parent to comfort you and no duvet to wrap yourself tight in to protect you from the things that go bump in the night and make you feel like everything is going to be alright. What an exhausting life this is, to be continuously pulled apart by those horses. One called mania, one called depression.\n\nOver the next few weeks I sink lower and lower. That emotional submarine seeking deeper, darker worlds where the weight of your own mind is too heavy for your body to lift from the bed and the thought of moving an inch is akin to climbing Everest. Exaggerating I am not. I turn the key over in the ignition but the engine doesnt fire. I wear the darkness like a cloak around me, soft, comforting, and sickly. And so the cycle continues. Rinse and repeat Rebuilding myself and those relationships that I have thrown against the wall in anger and broken each and every time. I am immensely guilty for my actions, for my words, for the consequences of my existence.\n\nI visit the psychiatrist. She is a wonderful being with a keen ear and a calm demeanour. I feel much better, naturally, with some distance between this visit and the event. My cycles are changing and I have some energy to exist, now. Because of that, I feel like a fraud, like I shouldnt be here. And that every breath I take is stolen from someone else. Someone deserving. But I am here and I have been writing down how I feel each day so I no longer have the luxury of dishonesty, explaining it away and pretending it isnt me, it isnt real, it is just a warped memory. Not today, dear boy. Today is justified. We sit, she talks, I talk, we both listen. Not just to each other but to the ebb and flow of feelings and emotions that spill forth into the air. I feel better getting all this off my chest. She tells me I have either bipolar type 2 or cyclothymia (a milder form of bipolar), but she cant give me a formal diagnosis without a review in 4-months time, after I have been clean for 6 months. I am very careful to say have and not am. This is an illness, it does not define me. You are not your stubbed toe or your broken arm, you are not your wheelchair or your skin colour or your job that you may love or despise. I explain I have spent many years clean but she wants to be certain, given the complexity of her craft, and I respect that. I now have a reason to stop abusing my mind and body. I am grateful for the carrot at the end of a stick.\n\nIn truth, were all ill. Its just by how much?. Ive just got a little less of what this broken society deems acceptable and controllable. And how ill must we be to stray so far from the symbiosis of nature and its processes. Creating our beliefs in fictitious things like money and security. Were all completely fucking mental.\n\nWhat truly matters is being in nature and not knowing names for everything but knowing what place and what role it has on this earth. To know this in our souls because it is in our genes, pulsing through our veins with every kick of the heart. Connected. Something we will never ever know. Not to the bone. We are not designed for bricks and mortar and office chairs and sitting in traffic swearing at the mostly-empty cars in front whilst slowly poisoning ourselves as we suck on the billowing, black exhaust pipe smoke. I want none of it, thank you. I have never felt consistently better than when Ive been in touch with nature, out in the world and amongst the trees and calling birds. Isnt it time to actually live a little bit? Isnt it time to reject the ideals presented to us as statute?Isnt it time to cut the fat from the world? Working your best, most able years just to retire in a big house with nothing to do,  nothing you are able to do, and have the brain fade away and die in front of the eyes of your family members so you can bequeath to them a larger portion of that fictitious belief system. What a joke this all is. Im not ashamed to say that and I feel better and stronger and richer for it. I know now it does not, and will not bring me happiness, or peace.\n\nMy point is, I am becoming comfortable within myself and in living the life that I want to live. With that, the cycles will be more manageable, I will be able to function in my own way. I have hope. A hope Ive never felt before. I will have bad days, and bad weeks, but these are just sticks floating by in that proverbial river. I am learning what I love and doing more of it. And doing less of what I despise. And in this hope that I am holding with fear and excitement like a father does with a newborn child, I know that you will see hope, too, for yourselves and your futures. Never be ashamed to be you. Were all ill and we cant all fit into the same mould. I hope that those without a mental illness will read this and gain a little insight into what it is like to have an illness as legitimate as a broken leg or cancer. So when you meet someone who is just a little sad, know that they may be at the end. And you might save their life by listening to them. Remember that everyone is different and your reality is not everyone elses. Remember that those people who have broken bones, or wheelchairs, or cancers, or poor mental health are numerous. Were not alone. Youre not alone. Educate. Speak. Listen. People are dying from poor mental health but we do not need to. It can be survived. Managed. Healed. Beaten. Remembered. And respected.\n\nAll I needed to do is talk about it honestly. I am so thankful for such wonderful friends and professionals to help me through. I trust in them.\n\nJP Collins'"
penicillin side effect,https://www.reddit.com/r/headaches/comments/g4urno/ive_significantly_reduced_my_tension_headaches/,"b""I've significantly reduced my Tension Headaches""",,"b'A little backstory, my tension headaches would usually start when I woke up. It would be a tightness or tension feeling in my neck, right below the skull. It would slowly build throughout the day and I was always unable to relief it. I would try, and it would rise to the the top of my skull into a painful headache where I\'d need to lay down. I used to try to beat it whenever I got it. But realized it was better to just take headache medicine. I was only really taking it 1-2 times a week, I believe. I developed an allergy to Ibuprofen and switched to Aleve. The Aleve took way longer to kick in so I felt more pain. When we feel pain we want to fix it, so I spent years trying to figure it out. \n\nI believe I have solved it for the most part and I don\'t know specifically what fixed it so I will tell you what changed for me. \n\nFirst, telling myself to sit up straight was not working. My posture is awful and I think it\'s a big factor for tension headaches. \n\nHere\'s what I started doing: \n* Strength training regularly (calisthenics, kettlebell, weights)\n* Using a Standing desk way more at work\n* Yoga for posture (lots of playlists for 5, 10 minutes)(I recently fell out of this but doesn\'t seem to have an effect yet)\n* Running every other day to relieve tension\n* I have a nice heating pack (with rice) that I warm up and lay on my shoulders throughout the day. It feels so good!\n* The change that had the biggest impact IMO or maybe just topped it off was Not using a pillow AND sleeping on my back. I went through 8 different pillows and eventually switched to no pillow, but ALSO I went from a side sleeper to a back sleeper. This was Tough! I was willing to get no sleep for it though and still catch myself on my Side sometimes. \n\n**UPDATE**\nStill sleeping on my back, but I have also believe the cardio needs to be highlighted. Making sure extra tension/stress is burned off is very important. I bike 8 miles every other day or so. (~30 minutes) My nails are growing (I\'ve always chewed them off from anxiety/stress), my jaw is no longer tense from grinding, and my neck is not tense when I wake up. Seriously, add exercise to your lifestyle and add some more. Train safely and work your way up. This will become a lifestyle for you because every time you don\'t want to do some cardio you should be thinking of your worse tension headache or night of teeth grinding. \n\n**EDIT** I have a memory foam topper for my mattress so my head sinks into it a little bit. I think it\'s 3 inch. So you still may need a really thin memory foam pillow. Sleep on my back may be the most crucial.\n\nBut if you look at how you side sleep you curl up. So I was ""hunched"" 8 hours at work and 6-8 hours while sleeping. \n\nMy tension headaches only come back if I sit on the couch and game for a really long time. I\'d say I went from 1-2 a week to 1 every month or 2 maybe. \n\nHope this gives some people some hope. I was really at the mercy of these damn headaches. But now I\'m moving on to trying to improve my bruxism LOL'"
corticosteroid swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/DermatologyQuestions/comments/10f4h0t/im_at_my_wits_endsevere_atopic_dermatitis_eczema/,b'Im at my wits end(severe atopic dermatitis [eczema] please help)',,"b'Hey everyone,\n\nFirst time poster, long time reader. My eczema/atopic dermatitis/allergy journey has been a long and painful one, so apologies for the long post. \n\nI was first diagnosed with eczema at around 5(?) or so, pretty much right after recovering from pneumonia on antibiotics (which I think ruined my immune system and causes my issues). Pretty much ever since then, the treatment eczema has dominated my life. Its been constant use of corticosteroid creams (taromometasine, protopic, elidel etc etc). Every few months Id have a good period where I didnt really flare too badly and it seemed under control, but beginning in about 10th grade my eczema started to get so much worse. \n\nFirst it happened on my scalp, where Id get these huge lesions and scabs that I would scratch and that would weep (my mom used to comb them out and apply my ointments, bless her soul). But that eventually went away. Then it got really bad along my arm and hands to the point where it would stick to my clothes and would need to be dressed like wounds. Eventually, that cleared up. \n\nFast forward to my first year in Uni, the real start of the decline. Quickly my skin started to be at an all time low. It was flaky, dry, itchy and would clump in these huge scaled patches, and would crack, weep and bleed despite any treatment. Suddenly Covid hit toward the end of my first year and I pushed through. At the start of second year it wasnt that bad, manageable but still painful. \n\nEventually during second year it got to a point where I couldnt move, like I was physically unable to move because of how much pain I was in (not the worst sentencing during quarantine but still a defeating fate). That summer I had to drop courses that were running on campus because of my skin and the pain levels (first time Ive ever let my eczema dictate or come in the way of my academic progression). \n\nThat summer I ended up in hospital because I had no other alternative due to closures and restrictions here in Canada. The doctor prescribed my oral steroids so I would qualify for light therapy. After taking the steroids for ONE day, my pain was immediately reduced but the condition of my skin remained the same. I was then (somewhat) forced into starting UV light therapy as the doctor I saw said that I needed to do so to qualify for stronger treatment options (no hate at all). After enduring the most painful and excruciating months, light therapy was over and my skin had only gotten worse.\n\nAfter all of this my skin was still not any better, and I was started on Dupixent (dupilimab) with bi-weekly injections. At first it was amazing, my skin cleared up, I has no pain and was the happiest I had been in so longbut that didnt last for long. About four/five months on Dupixent I started to develop weird hives (grouped) and subsequently aquagenic urticaria that would show up about 5 minutes after injecting Dupixent, and would disappear an hour later. Sadly the water sensitivities and hives persisted and the Dupixent stopped working. \n\nI told my doctors and they all suggested I stop dupixent as it seemed that I was having an allergic reaction to the drug. Following this development I was started on Rinvoq (the immunosuppressant) which, again, worked wonders at first. Now, Im still on Rinvoq (about 6 months in and in my fourth year) and although my eczema is much better than it was, I still get constant flareups (WEEKLY) that are more similar to allergic reactions (swollen, hot, hive, bumpy, painful, itchy large patches on my face, neck, back, arms and shoulders). The Rinvoq helps overall but these flareups are fucking unbearable, and it doesnt even seem like eczema anymore. I still use protopic to manage these flares as well as ice packs, ice masks, cold rollers and fans to bring down the swelling. The only moisturizer that works for me is vaseline which I use everyday, 3 times a day. \n\n[EXTRA] - Ive gone through allergy testing (nothing out of the ordinary and have removed anything associated), have dieted and cut out potential dietary triggers (i.e., dairy, hazelnut, red meat, etc), I only use NATURAL (no sulphates, alcohol, etc) soaps and detergents, and I take lukewarm (not cold or hot) showers. I dont smoke weed or drink at all, only take my Vyvanse (40mg daily) and vape. \n\nMy doctors are lovely and have been such a big help, as have my family, girlfriend and friends, but I cant keep living like this and just dreading doing anything that might effect and make my skin any more worse than it constantly is. I just feel like such a burden to those most involved in my life and my journey, and just want for this to end so that I can get back to being helpful, doing the things that I love and finding some peace. \n\nAnyways, thanks for listeningIm not expecting a cure-all treatment or method, even pity or shame. All I wanna know is if there is anyone else who has/had similar symptoms, what they are doing/did and if theres anything else I can try. Thanks. \n\n[pics available if yall want] \n\n- Oct :)'"

codeine eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/qysbum/sobriety_and_revelations/,b'Sobriety and Revelations',,"b'Hi friends- I needed somewhere safe and anon to unload. Its been a rough few days. Trigger Warning: Child abuse, Drug use\n\nTL;DR- Toxic childhood, abandonment, sobriety and questioning mothers role in my trauma. Am I being unreasonable for cutting her off?\n\nBit of back story- \n\nI was an only child (just my mum and I) until I was 8. I had a reasonably normal childhood up to that point. Id spend a fair bit of time with my grandparents (mothers side) due to mum needing to work full time.\nAt this job she worked at, she met the man who would eventually be my step-father. \nAs a child, my biological father was not very involved, but I still had a bit of contact with him and his side of the family. \n\nFast forward- Mother and Step-father obviously get married. \nHe was an angry man, but then extremely kind at other times. I thought this was normal. \nThey end up having 2 kids, my brother and sister, 10 and 12 years younger.\n\nIt didnt take long for the the grooming and inappropriate behaviours to begin. \nAsking me to shower with him after school before mum got home, showing me how to wash myself, making inappropriate comments about my body and appearance etc. Mum was none the wiser. This lasted until I was 14 (I guess I outgrew his interests)\nThere was also physical and emotional abuse, for 10 years. I witnessed knives held to throats, threats of suicide and threats of murder. He never hit my mother but did throw things, yell abuse at her and restrain her (her words). \nMy parents also had 42 foster children in our care over 5 years, who were all high needs, who also made allegations of varying abuse from step father. Because of the children having high needs, I was often left to my own devices and forgotten about. Apparently this made me hard to love or be proud of, because I wasnt making good choices (she told me this today). \nShe never told me she loved me or was proud of my until I was 23 when I called her out in it- and said her love language is giving not saying. She began saying it more after that. \n\nI moved out at 18, and I finally hit breaking point one night. \nMum and I had been at a local club having some drinks after work, and she had separated from him a few weeks prior due to obvious ongoing abuse. I was proud of her.  \nWe had a arrived at my mothers home so I could pick up my vehicle to travel home (about another 25 mins away). As I walked through the house, I saw he was in her bed. \nI snapped. Walked out of the house and burst into tears and called my grandmother, and disclosed everything. My world turned upside down that night. \n\nWe moved away. Mum, siblings, me and ex partner moved 800kms away to my grandparents home to start fresh and heal. I underwent mental health assessment and began therapy. \nOnly 4 months after moving, mum said she saw on my Facebook that I had apparently left open- I was lying. This is not true. \nShe moved back to him that day whilst I was away with a friend. \n\nAt this point- I broke. I ended up in the local psychiatric ward, after stating to my grandparents I had every intention of KMS. i was only there 5 days over easter, but on my first night, my mother rang to abuse me on the ward phone for being a drama queen. \n\nI was 19. I stayed with my grandparents for the remainder of that year, but due to the small town mentality and no work, I moved back to my home town. I hadnt spoken to my mother until my return, and she was still with him. I suppressed much of those feelings and wanted to move on and reintegrated into the family, still living externally but keeping a close eye to watch my siblings who were still at risk. \nI learnt about narcissism, which is exactly what my stepfather is. \nMy diagnosis is C-PTSD and ADHD. \n\nSo- I fell heavily into drugs. \nWhen I was 15, I first was introduced to Codeine, due to working in a manual labour job and requiring pain relief to even walk after work. I took them accidentally think they were just plain paracetamol. Those pills were not prescribed to my mother or stepfather but given from a family member after major surgery. \nThey made me feel so good and relaxed. \nIt was my 13th year of opioid use in 2021. I went from codeine to morphine and oxy progressively. I had a car accident which resulted in some slipped discs and arthritic bone spurs, so I had access to opioids always. Benzos for the muscular pain. \nI also got into to party drugs and later, into the much heavier drugs. I was an ice/speed addict for 4 years, up until my own son was born. It was my only coping mechanism. \n\nI have undergone intense therapy, particularly in the last 4 years, and had progressively started not taking as many painkillers or benzos, with no particular reason why. This started about 6 months ago and I can only assume its because Im in a really good mental place, I am preparing for a surgery that will positively impact my life and also being a parent has made me very aware of my mortality. \n\nIn the last 2 weeks, I have been stone cold sober. I have quit vaping (3 years no tobacco, vaping 9mg of nicotine), all painkillers except paracetamol and nurofen as required and quit marijuana. \nThe withdrawals were painful emotionally and made me physically ill, and I wouldnt take it back. Worth every second. \nI have mourned (and often still do) the life I lead, and celebrating whats ahead. \n\nMy biggest challenge has been seeing things from a different perspective, and realising that my mother never protected me. \nWhen I was getting abused, she wasnt, so allowed it. \nShe abandoned me when I needed her. She didnt fully believe me until my sister disclosed 18 months ago and I am struggling to come to terms with that even though I thought it was resolved. She left my stepfather 3 years ago and has been no contact for 2 (siblings were still under 18 at that time). \nBrother disclosed physical assault for years and sister sexually assaulted also. This monster is pure garbage. \n\nAm I being unreasonable in how I am feeling? Ive had quite invasive thoughts through this process and I have actually cut contact with her today, because I need some time to come to terms with my new life. \nShe says I am bitter and selfish. \n\nI feel like she let me down. Her abuse began before they were married and she didnt leave. I know she was stuck in a domestic violence cycle herself. She was scared. \n\nAm I asking too much to have my feelings acknowledged and understood?'"

NSAID eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/lia9sj/pregnancy_and_sciatic_pain_from_a_disc/,b'Pregnancy and sciatic pain (from a disc)',,"b""Hey!  \n\n\nI've stalked this sub for a couple of weeks now, and it's very interesting to read everyone's stories, so I thought I'd ask for advice as well. I apologize in advance for the long-winded story, but I feel like if anyone understands and sympathises, it's people from this community.\n\nFirst and foremost, I'm currently pregnant - 27 weeks, but pregnancy did not cause my sciatic pain - I wish. Back in March 2020 I deadlifted too heavy and hurt my lower back (was in a lot of pain for about 2 weeks - but only in lower back). It fixed itself somewhat; meaning I was able to continue working out, but some positions caused a bit of right leg pain. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn December (when I was already about 20 weeks pregnant) I decided to do some Pilates, and after that, the pain started to travel down my right leg - sitting was uncomfortable, and standing up after sitting caused some shooting pains. Nothing too bad, and walking made it better. However, the pain started to get worse and worse, despite me still being active. I started getting some pain in the middle of the night when I would wake up to use the bathroom - going back to bed after that was uncomfortable - I had a hard time finding a position where it wouldn't hurt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to finally being able to see a neurologist in January, who pretty quickly said (after doing the straight leg test and a quick examination) it was L5 radiculopathy (aka sciatica), and suggested that I might try water aerobics, and I probably wouldn't get any relief from PT. She also suggested that I already stay home from work and just try to take it easy. I followed her instructions - I'm currently on my sick leave and won't have to go back to work for a long time (perks of living in Europe). Around January 18th, I also decided to go try water aerobics. Now this is where it got *real.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring the aerobics I felt fine, but the day after - oh boy... I have never felt pain like that in my entire life. It hurts *constantly*. Walking is painful (or any kind of pressure on my leg), laying down is painful (I only have one very specific position where I'm somewhat pain-free), turning around while laying down is the worst, coughing/sneezing is horrible, turning my body is painful - in short, *everything* hurts, and it's so bad in the morning. I wake up and start my day with tears in my eyes, because it's so bad. The neurologist did prescribe 150mg of Diclac (a NSAID), and it's the only thing that will calm down the pain for about 24 hours. But since I'm pregnant, I can only take it until about 33 weeks (an internal md's advice), and definitely not every day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe internal doc also sent me to get an x-ray (the queues for MRIs are long, and the exposure from an x-ray is safer for the baby as well) to see if anything is so bad that it required emergency surgery. They could see that there is significant narrowing between the L5-S1 vertebrae, but nothing that would warrant surgery while pregnant. I also have been seeing a PT and we've been trying to do light stretching and exercises in a warm pool, but doing them in the water hurts as well. No amount of stretching or moving (I've tried a bunch from youtube PTs) has actually helped with the pain, it just hurts to do them, and it doesn't feel good at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here I am - 27 weeks pregnant (13 weeks!! to go), in horrible pain every day. And I know it's going to get worse as the baby continues to grow and push on my spine as well. Any advice on how to handle the pain? After having the baby, should I push for immediate surgery? I cannot even imagine how it would be like to take care of the baby while being in such tremendous pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone (pregnant or not!) has any advice for me, I'd greatly appreciate it."""

Of course, as the pain didn\'t improve, my lack of regular, known and friendly Doctor meant I wasn\'t really taken seriously till much, much later.\n\nAfter said ex kicked me out of her life because I just laid on the couch in pain (bad sign, if you don\'t improve after a few weeks SEEK MEDICAL HELP from a *GOOD DOCTOR*), I moved back home with my parents (funnily enough, that phone call I made to mum explaining how my life fell apart and I needed to flee home was captured by an Apple Maps Street View car. The LOWEST moment of my life is publicly viewable. I have it bookmarked and show people for a laugh). Embarrassing, but important. After a few months of being there, I knew I\'d have to \'start the process\' in whichever new city I moved to.\n\nOnce the move occurred, I sought out a trustworthy GP. Mum mentioned that as a child Lyrica was prescribed to me and it helped me a bunch and that I should go to talk to a doctor about it. I did, and it didn\'t really do much at the low dosage I was started on. In the end I was on 600, sometimes 1200mg a day, but I digress.\n\n\'the process\' is the pathway of increasingly severe interventions a Primary Healthcare Provider will request to help manage your pain and overall condition. Surgery is the last and most serious intervention they can request, they don\'t want to operate on you unless they know it\'s the only thing that will fix you. Call it ego on behalf of the surgeons, but the reason you have to go though with all of this is simple, you don\'t want surgery unless you absolutely need it. If a twice yearly injection \'fixes\' you, that\'s good news. Run with it. In my case, I got my first CT guided injection roughly 1 year after the initial injury. I couldn\'t really help it, the city I moved to is the city known for having the most lockdowns in the world, so even though I arrived in August last year, it wasn\'t until something like November or December that year that I received my injection. I don\'t know if it was the additional movement due to the lockdown ending and me finding work or the injection but I began to feel better, but that feeling didn\'t last long.\n\nAfter switching jobs to something I thought would be better (it wasn\'t), my pain got worse. Then, one day, I crashed my Electric Scooter doing something dumb to impress a girl (she didn\'t sleep with me again, boooooooo). Mum argues that is what made my herniation go from \'manageable\' to \'unbearably bad\' and although I disagree, it was around that time that I realised this new job was horrible and made my back condition worse. I was pushed out of that job by the incompetent asshole of an owner (your groans and cries of pain are off-putting to the customers perhaps you should consider another job). Never again. I left that job in April of this year and have been (sadly, not from a lack of trying) unemployed since.\n\nFrom there, I spent the next 4 months on my ass getting worse and worse. I\'d given up. Who can blame me? I was in crippling pain every day, my mood was super low and my dreams were shattered. I\'d moved to this new city hoping to make a fresh start and I\'d ended up being haunted by the ghost of my past. In those 4 months I considered either throwing myself in front of a car to cause Cauda Equina, throwing myself off my balcony to end the pain entirely, or going to hospital and telling them I wasn\'t leaving until I got surgery, cut marks on my arm notwithstanding. It sucked. I wouldn\'t wish it on my worst enemy, well, maybe my *worst* enemy, but definitely not someone I disliked a bunch.\n\nFrom getting referred to see a specialist and getting my second (ineffective) injection in April to seeing a specialist in August, I was in Limbo. This was the time where my left leg lost a lot of muscle mass and mobility, compounding the issues I was facing and making things worse. I was so fucking glad I had the scooter, I don\'t know if I\'d still be here if it weren\'t for me having it, I have no clue how I\'d have gone to get groceries or get around in general otherwise, was absolutely my \'mobility scooter\' for the entire time.\n\nSeeing the specialist in August was the first time I had hope in a long, long time. As negative as it sounds, being told that ""you can do all the physiotherapy, exercise, walking, well wishing and medication you want, but you won\'t get better unless we remove that thing from your back"" was the best thing I\'d ever heard. I felt vindicated for all the time I\'d spent languishing in pain, being told by bad physios that \'you just need to push past it\' (horrible advice, if you have a scan that shows a herniation larger than 1cm you ain\'t pushing past SHIT), taking more and more severe medication to control the pain, all of it for nothing to change. My surgery was a definite \'end\' date to this period of my life.\n\nI was classified as a category 2A patient. Category 1 is \'oh shit we gotta do something about this or you\'ll end up with serious damage/dying\', category 2 is \'oh damn we need to get you fixed up but you won\'t die or be left crippled from this if we put you on ice\' and category 3 is \'uhh, I guess we should operate, but you don\'t seem too phased by this so we\'ll see you in a year\'. Mum again thinks my scooter crash bumped me from a category 3 to a category 2, and if that\'s the case, I\'m fucking glad I did because I\'d have ended up on my ass either way, so if I get surgery earlier because of it I\'m happy.\n\nFrom there it was a waiting game. I was told 3 months was the \'recommended\' amount of time I should be operated within, but given the fact they couldn\'t operate on Category 2 patients at that time (my consult was via phone but they deemed my situation so important that I should come in, they even tried to keep me overnight to operate on me the next day, but the surgeon told them (and me) to get the fuck out because she literally couldn\'t do it) and given the fact that the public hospital system was broken and still remains broken, I wasn\'t expecting to get a surgery date until next year whilst simultaneously letting them know to just \'chuck me in wherever you can fit me, even if it\'s 24h notice\'. Once I was told I was getting surgery, I could also push my GP (doctors where I live are called GPs) to give me stronger medication. I was given Codeine paracetamol beforehand, and arguably too much of it because I developed an addition to it, but I could now ask for stronger medication because it was a \'make me comfortable whilst I await surgery\' sort of thing instead of a \'I need this to walk but not really walk just to sleep properly but not sleep properly mainly just not feel pain for a few hours\' sort of thing.\n\nBang on 3 months, I got the call. ""Hey, what\'s going on? you didn\'t respond to our email, we want you to fill out this form and get your blood test done so you can have surgery!"" Wish I got that call last week, because I spent the weekend languishing in pain, mental and physical. My surgery was less than two weeks away. Amazing. Mum cried a little, she\'s got so many back, shoulder, neck and knee problems and she knows how good it feels to be told that \'we will fix you soon\'. If you\'re waiting for that call, and I promise it\'ll come, it\'ll be like finding out you got your dream job, it\'s such a relief, the light was now visible at the end of this horrid tunnel.\n\nBut now my feelings of helplessness were replaced with feelings of concern and anxiousness. What will I do to recover? how will I get food? Will I reherniate 3 days after and be back where I was? I\'m completely alone, how will I deal with things like dishes, cleaning, organising things? Sure, my spoilt, child-like, \'I moved out of home but not really because my parents own this apartment and I see them 5 times a week anyway\' 23 year old housemate who has to be nagged to unstack the dishwasher let alone clean anything will be about as helpful as catnip at a dog show so yeah, completely alone; all of these questions now flew around my mind and caused me to panic, and I\'m mainly writing this because...\n\n\n\n#Here\'s all of the things you should do to prepare for your Microdiscectomy\n\n\n##Do a buttload of washing and clean your house\n\nYou\'ll need clothes. You\'ll need clear spaces, or at least clear spaces which you\'ll make messy but be able to clean up without bending, you\'ll need clean bed sheets, you ain\'t changing them for at least 6 weeks if your bed is in the corner like mine is, all of these things need to be done and they all need to be done before your surgery. A mate of mine came over to help me clean, mainly to keep me on task but it was important.\n\n##Have a plan for food and pre-purchase any heavy goods\n\nYou won\'t be able to carry anything heavier than a gallon for 2 months. Plan accordingly. I moved my microwave from below the counter in a \'microwave hole\' as I call it to on top of the counter. I didn\'t buy foods that required oven cooking, and if I did I didn\'t eat them until at least a week after surgery. I got a bunch of noodles, random fruits and veg, a bunch of these things called \'Zooper Doopers\' which are sticks of frozen sticky liquid which you either eat like a candy bar or bash on the counter to make into a smooth ice dessert,  whatever you like to eat get some of it and eat it during your recovery. I filled my veg crisper with lettuce, oranges, pears and carrots.\n\n## Treat yourself to some paper plates, disposable cutlery and plastic/paper cups\n\nLast thing you wanna worry about is doing dishes or stacking/unstacking a dishwasher. If all of your tableware is disposable, you won\'t have to worry about it or risk your back bending down to stack/unstack a dishwasher. Yeah, environmentally it sucks, but you\'re recovering from surgery. Remember, environmental atrocities are still being performed en masse by faceless, greedy corporations fuelled by humanity\'s desire to destroy the planet on which they live; fuelling the ever growing hunger for growth and dividends; the horrible late stage capitalism we all know and love. Don\'t stress it, the disposable cups, plates, bowls and cutlery won\'t make a damn difference (think globally act locally is a disgusting lie), I forgive you.\n\n##Buy a \'grabby stick\' or reach extender\n\nThere\'s no worse feeling, especially directly after surgery, than awkwardly picking something up off the ground or reaching to grab something. An example would be me forgetting my AirPods on the other side of my bed. Pre surgery me would have just reached over to grab them, post surgery me has to log roll his ass onto the bed, grab them, then log roll off the bed to leave the house. Get a grabby stick. My recommendation would be for one with a metal rod which directly connects the jaws to the handle. you can rotate the head, apply way more pressure to things than the string based ones and it won\'t break on you.\n\n##Have shoes you can put on whilst standing\n\nI didn\'t. First thing I bought  post surgery were a pair of comfy, slip on vans (platform with checkerboard patterns because I\'m secretly an emo kid from 2007), you don\'t wanna fuck around with laces, and I love laces, my normal boots are 11 eye Solovairs, I know I was drunk on a night out when I wake up with my pants around my ankles laying the wrong way in bed with my boots half off because it requires perseverance and gumption to get them off, so you\'ll want something that isn\'t that.\n\n##Don\'t over-prepare\n\nIt\'ll be tempting to do some whack shit when you prepare for your MD, especially if you\'re alone. I did a bunch of other things, but I won\'t mention them because it\'s pointless to do so. They didn\'t matter.\n\n#My recovery experience so far\n\n* Day 1 was me waking up from anaesthesia and walking around my ward a bunch and having troubles getting in and out of bed. They give you a bunch of drugs so you aren\'t in pain, but you should feel immediate relief.\n\n* Day 2 I got released from hospital. My mate picked me up and we went to a local market and wandered around eating cool food and getting harassed by meat vendors. That was such a special day to me, not only because I\'d just spent a day in hospital but because for the first time in years I didn\'t feel like I needed to sit down or take way too many pills to enjoy myself. It was great.\n\n* Day 3-5 was nerve pain free and very comfortable. I had drugs to keep me feeling good, my back was incredibly stiff and sore, but I could walk and found it incredibly enjoyable. Be aware that this is a temporary feeling. Walking after a MD is such an amazing and novel thing, but you are still beholden to your stiff back.\n\n* Day 6 I walked a little too far and stretched my leg a little too much and my sciatic pain came back. I legitimately though I reherniated. Despite the specialist assuring me that \'you\'ll know when you\'ve reherniated\', you\'ll think that any sciatic pain or general leg pain is you reherniating and feeling terrible. Funnily enough, that was the day I forgot to take my medication, silly me, wonder if that had anything to do with it.\n\n* Day 7-11 was really more of the same, I\'d feel better, do some whack shit (like walk 4 km, the furthest I\'ve walked in 2 years), suffer the consequences (I got goddam DOMS from **WALKING**. ONLY in my left leg), think I\'d reherniated, remember that I hadn\'t taken my meds, take my meds and feel A-Okay again.\n\n\n#Things I\'d tell someone if they were facing a Microdiscectomy procedure\n\n##Everyone\'s journey is different and it\'s okay if yours isn\'t the dreamlike recovery you see described here\n\nYou may not feel complete relief immediately post surgery. Sorry, that\'s just the truth. I did, and it was amazing, but it wasn\'t linear. Once the Lidocaine in my back wore off and I was out of Oxys I started to feel sciatic pain again. It\'s a horrible feeling, you\'ll think you reherniated and that it was all for nothing, it\'s kinda crushing. But you will continue to get better. I keep thinking \'damn this shit isn\'t working\' but then I remember I\'m less than 2 weeks out from getting operated on. I\'m not even meant to be driving a car let alone completely healed from this. Depending on how long it\'s been since the initial incident, you\'ll feel more or less sciatic pain post surgery. This is because you have other associated problems like nerve damage (which will repair itself), restricted range of motion in the affected leg, muscle weakness stemming from your aversion to using that leg (you know, because it hurt like hell to do) and other random bits and pieces. I, for example, have to lose 20kg (45lb) to fit back into my pre injury clothing. That\'s gonna suuuuuuck, but at least I can now.\n\n##You aren\'t going to be as fucked up as you think you will be\n\nWhen you hear \'spine surgery\' you think of stupidly long recovery times and a complete inability to do anything meaningful, I know I did. Reality is, most people are up and walking after surgery. I was. Sure, you might get worse in the few weeks after surgery, but I was pleasantly surprised by how ambulant I was in the days after surgery. I made hamburgers, went for walks, was able to pretty easily stand up for extended periods (and preferred it to sitting), Absolutely didn\'t need the 20L of water I bought to put in my room *just in case*. As long as you\'re careful, and trust me, you\'ll be careful, you\'ll be able to do a surprisingly large amount of things immediately post surgery. Heck, I put on and hung up a load of washing because my asshole housemate couldn\'t be fucked doing it whilst I was in HOSPITAL, dumping it into my basket and washing her own shit, leading to it rotting and stinking up. Ugh. But still, I was able to squat down carefully, put it in, drag it out, kick it across the floor, pick it up from the basket with my grabby stick and hang it up. I didn\'t enjoy the process, but I was able to do it.\n\n##Beware of the period after the initial stiffness dies down\n\nAfter about a week post surgery the overwhelming stiffness that forced you to log roll and be careful of your back will fade. This is both a good and bad thing. It\'s good because you know, healing, but bad because you\'ll have what I like to call \'oops moments\'. You\'ll forget you have had back surgery (yes strange I know) and and instinctively go to do something, only to feel something weird, scare the shit out of yourself and slap yourself on the wrist. I dropped my AirPods case in a gutter full of rain water (the case is fine thankfully) and had a little split second freak out of ""Oh shit, I need to grab that now. OH SHIT BENDING DOWN TO PICK STUFF UP REQUIRES CAREFUL PLANNNING AHHHHHHHHHH"" and very carefully squatted and was able to fish it out of the gutter. Phew. Other \'oops moments\' include:\n\n- Shifting around in bed and feeling weird pain from your back and freaking out thinking your reherniated\n\n- Hearing the door ring with the pizza you ordered and launching yourself out of bed instinctively only to catch yourself, flop back into bed and log roll out of bed\n\n- Having the dog step on your nuts (seemingly her favourite activity) and having to resist the urge to curl up from pain, or at least curl up in pain in a safe manner, something which is hard to do because a goddam dog kicked you in the nuts.\n\n- Having your phone fall off the bed and going to twist and reach for it, only to again catch yourself doing that, log roll out of bed and fish it out with your grabby stick (buy a grabby stick buy a grabby stick BUY A GRABBY STICK)\n\n- *NSFW* Going to jerk your hog and realising you can\'t reach it properly laying completely flat and straight so you go to bend your back like you always do, catching yourself and working out some other way of making that whole thing work.\n\n- Getting out of the shower and going to bend down to dry your legs, catching yourself, getting annoyed and instead letting those boys air dry. I\'d consider getting a Terry cloth bathrobe instead of a towel so you can just wrap yourself in it to dry off.\n\n\n##Old habits die hard\n\nWhen you hear you\'re getting a MD soon you\'ll start to think of all the amazing things you\'ll do when you get out of surgery. You\'ll go for big walks, get back into the gym, never take muscle pain for granted ever again, whatever. But old habits die hard. You\'ve just spent X amount of time doing very little in the way of movement due to pain. Even with the absence of pain you\'ll very quickly slip back into these old habits. I know I have. Surgery isn\'t the immediate cure you think it is, it simply removes the root cause of your overall condition. In my case, my left leg still has the same crappy ROM it had before surgery, that isn\'t fixed. That\'s why my leg will hurt after extended walks (extended being more than 1km), it doesn\'t have the same ROM as my other leg and because I\'m actively focussed on walking straight and consistently I end up being sore afterwards. This will take time to fix, and once you\'re given the green light to attend a physiotherapist you\'ll be able to begin fixing those problems and *really* recovering from all of this.\n\n\n##Start lifting mindfully and never, ever stop\n\nYou will have a weak spot in your back for the rest of your life. How do you protect it? By making sure the muscles that surround it are as strong as they can be. Right now they\'re weak, tight and fragile, like your back is. Eventually the Annulus Fibrosis will seal back up, but it\'ll be with scarred tissue. When you\'re recovering, talk to your physio about what you can do to strengthen that area and never stop doing those things until you die, or become so old you can\'t.\n\n\n###*Arguably the most important one*\n\n#*Your time suffering from sciatica has been a gift. Do not forget your pain.*\n\n*You have, in a sick way, been given a gift*. This gift is a glimpse into your future if you don\'t take care of yourself. If you get surgery, you get to leave the pain cave. Many people don\'t get that luxury. This is your gift. Cherish it, remember it when you don\'t feel like going to the gym, doing your stretches or going for that run in a year\'s time. Never, EVER forget the pain you lived through, the dreams you had of not being stuck inside your home, unable to exist in the world as a healthy, ambulant, productive member of society, completely hopeless and alone in your suffering. I won\'t ever forget that time, it was horrid, easily the worst time in my life, I\'ll probably get some sort of tattoo to etch it onto my skin to ensure I don\'t ever forget it.\n\n#Suffering from Sciatica was the worst time of my life, and I\'ll do whatever it takes to make sure it stays that way.\n\n\nBoy, that was a long post. I don\'t really care, you don\'t get a TL;DR. I\'m glad I got to write down my thoughts, and if it helps anyone I\'m glad.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions about what I discussed or any questions you have in relation to the process. I\'ll probably make a post at the 6 or 12 week mark, see how I feel about it.\n\nAlright thanks for listening.'"

No preexisting conditions, southern USA, white, about 5\'11"" and 145 lbs. On Thursday and Friday last week he stated he was tired and wanted to go to bed early. I thought this was unusual but I figured he had not got enough sleep that week. Saturday morning he had a fever. for the next few days I assumed he had a cold until Monday when he started to break out in rash and pimples on his arms, legs, chest and face. \n\nWe suspected staph, which he confirmed at a doctor\'s appointment on Tuesday. he works as a commercial electrician and received a cut last week which we think is the cause. Dr said take Bactrim DS tablets 1 by mouth 2x a day for 10 days and kelfex 500mg every 12 hours for 10 days. one antibiotic was for potential strep, but his culture was negative for strep. only positive for staph. \n\n\nI\'ve also given him day and night theraflu and acetaminophen for pain and fever, and vitamin C supplements. I\'ve also put cool rags on his head and chest to try to keep the fever down but it always ends up shooting back up.\n\n\nI\'m also concerned about how contagious he is at this point, to myself and my 10 year old son. I\'ve shared a bed with him the entire time but we have avoided intimacy or touching, and have washed clothes/towels daily and sheets every few days. my son and I have no symptoms at this point.\n\nnow we are on day 6. this is day 3 of antibiotics and really no change. He still has the marks, his eyes are bloodshot and most of the time his temperature is in the 102 range. It has been as low as 98 and as high as 103.3 this past week. He has had upset stomach and diarrhea I guess due to the antibiotics. low appetite but has attempted to eat. normally responsive, sleeping OK, good attitude. mild body aches. \n\n\n\nmy concern is how long he has had a fever. I tried to ask the ER if he should come in and they said they can\'t advise me over the phone. I worry it may or already has entered his blood, I don\'t know how to tell if he is getting better because it seemed nothing has changed. any advice or experience with this would be greatly appreciated. thank you!!!!'"
Advil vomit,https://www.reddit.com/r/headaches/comments/dkdn28/weird_headaches_feels_like_something_is_wrong/,b'Weird Headaches: Feels Like Something is Wrong',,"b'Hello,\n\nI am a 24 year old female on no meds who was diagnosed with a case of vestibular neuritis, beginning August 17th. I woke up that day extremely dizzy and nauseous, vomited twice, and had some diarrhea. The dizziness (spinning, like vertigo), lasted another two days, though no more vomiting. It started to get a bit better, and then the dizziness rapidly shifted feeling - from spinning to rocking, as if I was on a boat. I was taking Gravol to control the ensuing nausea (as I am already quite prone to motion sickness). Initially I was unable to read or look at a computer, but I was able to lie down and watch mindless TV. These symptoms gradually abated after about 7 weeks.\n\nDuring this time I went to see two ENTs and a neurologist, and had an MRI (on August 27th, found to be normal). After describing my symptoms, I was diagnosed with vestibular neuritis rather than vestibular migraines (that was a concern, as I am generally prone to migraines, though never before have I experienced something of this nature), since I was not experiencing headaches during this time.\n\nAt my last appointment with my ENT on September 20th, the doctor had me lie down with my head hanging over the edge of the table to test how I felt. I immediately felt nauseous, and when I went home I wasnt feeling well and I went to sleep. I woke up and felt quite intense pressure in my neck and at the top left side of my head.\n\nSince this time I have had these odd pressure-pain headaches almost every day. They travel around, generally beginning at the base of my skull, to follow along to either the top left or right of my head, and often concentrate near my temples (above my ear). At first I thought they might be tension headaches, but I also feel tenderness around the areas where the pain is, and its been weeks that Ive had these symptoms now. Neither regular Advil, Tylenol, nor Voltaren/Naproxen alleviate the pain, and Im starting to worry that theres something wrong.\n\nI have also had some jaw pain on-and-off since August, and although this might be potentially unrelated, I have had symptoms of costichondritis as well as soreness around the joints in my arms and my lower legs since early September.\n\nI am getting quite anxious, and I do not know what to do - I know what normal headaches and migraines feel like, and these arent them. Does anyone have any ideas? Should I consider getting another MRI, considering the headache symptoms started about a month after the initial dizziness (and thus after my first - and only - MRI)?\n\nThank you.'"

So I'm not 100% sure if it was just time, or if it was my due diligence and stretches and exercises.

I think the culprit is from sitting too much. I sit in an office for 8 hours then go home and sit front of a computer for another 5-8 hours with bad posture.\n\n29th/30th - The pain worsens\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSept\n\n3rd - Started taking Ibuprofen, didn't really help\n\n4th - Started to go to the gym to stretch (this was my biggest mistake). Not because I went to the gym, but I didn't research the appropriate stretches\n\n10th - Started to use Robaxacet (didnt' really help). Started muscle relaxant and painkillers. I want to say it might have helped a bit with the relaxant and pain killers\n\n11th - From the meds I started to feel better, maybe 20-30% less pain, but once again I do not recommend this unless you really can't sleep since it is just covering up the symptoms.\n\n14th- I noticed my posture is off and my back is straight (it should have a natural arch) but it is straight.\n\n15th - Tried some THC and rested. I dont think this really helped either.\n\n17th Started to do tennis ball roll on the back, it was really painful, didn't help too much either.\n\n18th feels like i can bend and move more, sitting presses against my nerves, but i can do back lifts/extension  without issues. This is also the day where I started feeling less back pain and more in the legs. The pain is moving down to my foot.\n\n19th- Went to Athletic therapy and realizes pain worsens. This whole time the stretches I've been doing involved a lot of flexion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wqd093kj7jm21.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=af6234fbed2508666cad6fcad197bef61e0f5fae\n\nI always heard if you can touch your toes, you have a healthy back. So I continued to push myself no matter how painful it was to do the flexion exercises. However this is what damaged my back more. I gritted through the pain believing no pain no gain.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT DO THIS. This amount of pain brought tears to my eyes. Later in Nov/Dec I had my MRI and CT scan I realize in addition to sciatica, this was a herniated disc with a huge mass pushing against my spinal nerves.  So pretty much my flexion stretches pushed out that disc gel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n21st - I went to the doctors and Naproxen, but I dont believe this was strong enough to ease the pain.\n\nAt this point in time I can't walk, sit or sleep without extreme pain.\n\n21/25th- Started to try Chiropractors. I never trusted chiros and didn't believe in their work. After this entire event, I am still sticking to that. None of the cracking, or manipulation aided in the recovery. They did give me a back support belt which wasn't helpful during that time. I've used the back support belt in January- March 2019 on and off. So...there's that\n\n26th- Massage therapy, at this point the RMT wasn't too helpful, however advice of soaking in warm/hot water with epson salt (i didnt use salt though) for 15-30 minutes was a bit helpful. Im not sure how helpful, but it allowed me to relax and promote blood flow on the back. Hoping this would heal it faster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOct\n\n26th/Oct 3- tried acupuncture. I am afraid of needles and this was a painful procedure too. I can't say much about this experience. I dont think acupuncture can cure sciatica, however I do truly believe the pain it causes during the meeting releases natural pain killers ( adenosine ) this enables you focus and on resting and recovering the back. Imagine you hurt your arm and someone comes and slaps you in the face, you forget about your arm and focus on the face. This is of course temporary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring this whole time I've been going to Physio too. Keep in mind finding the right physio is crucial. I've been to a few that denied it was sciatica or gave me flexion stretches.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point I have taken (please don't mix meds! Consult your doctor if you are uncertain)\n\nNaproxen\n\nGabapentin\n\nAmittriptyline\n\nCyclobenzaprine\n\nI hate pain killers, I normally dont even take tylenol or advil. However because of the pain I was in. I had to take some for the nerve pain and some for sleep. Essentially all these meds, chiro, acupuncture, massage, physio was to get me comfortable enough to rest and sleep.\n\nI wanted to reiterate, I can barely walk, I would limp and it wouldn't be far. I can't sit at all. I would need to lie on the floor to eat, and watch tv. I can't sleep at night unless i take drugs. I've tried pillow between legs etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n12th This is when I found a physio that knew the Mackenzie method of back recovery. I did a lot of research on the Mackenzie method and thanks to  [u/ItchesForRiches](https://www.reddit.com/user/ItchesForRiches) post I was able to find a Physio that did Mackenzie. I tried to do these stretches a bit on my own but thought they were useless. Until I went to the physio and he very very methodically went through a few items and slowly introduced exercises. I'm not patient and this guy was super slow. However his exercises worked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Oct- Dec**Following exercises and customize exercise. Went to take MRI and CT scans, waited to see if I need surgery. Had the meeting in March, spoilers, I do not need surgery. Maybe back in Oct/Nov I might have been recommended surgery, but even then they can't push that gel back in, they need to cut it out, remove it, possibly even fusing my spine which would limit my back movement. So if you can, try to avoid surgery since it's not even a guarantee heal.\n\nDuring this time I essentially just continued to do the stretches like clockwork, over and over again. 3 times a day, for 3 months. Each week or two I'd notice less pain and slight improvements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the exercises\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 1 Flexion\n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bntvhnsk7jm21.png?width=240&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=229d7dba30586edadeccde3e401fb1248c121096\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxhhr7jl7jm21.png?width=240&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=21eba8d818f6072f090264a75f2d0c546d6bf426\n\n**Instructions**\n\nStand up straight with your feet together, about one foot away from a wall.Place your outermost hand on the side of your pelvis so as to apply pressure on the top of the pelvic bone.Use your hand to push your pelvis towards the wall so as to cause your back to stretch towards one side.Relax your back.PROGRESSION: Repeat with your feet further away from the wall.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** every 3 hrs | **Hold:** 5 secs | **Tempo:** glide hips to left only\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 2 Active ROM rotation\n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ys2j54hm7jm21.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f11f0a9db64b5ee27d6fcf74cded309d6a466fdd\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jkfrerfn7jm21.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9d93a5aa12b63bd5f1161bb6067f17e2e2c5a417\n\n**Instructions**\n\nLie on your back and with your knees bent and foot on the floor (crook lying).Place arms out to side for stability.Slowly lower legs to one side until you feel a gentle stretch and then to the other side.Return to neutral position and repeat.Keep your knees together during the movement.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** 3 x a day | **Hold:** 15 secs\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 3 Single knee to chest\n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7rt4ijbo7jm21.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=00e4e80f2e202b4206c965a388b20902652b9baf\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/de2m8gap7jm21.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6e005c7f71d79fa5ea7dc7497f086d6645dbc621\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Instructions**\n\nLie on your back with both knees bent, hands behind one knee.Pull the knee towards your chest slowly, release and then repeat until pain relief or as prescribed by your therapist.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** 3 x a day | **Hold:** 15 secs\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 4 Thoracic stretch\n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/73sxlk5q7jm21.png?width=240&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=09af89f032842e7da84846d814a4507830bed1de\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y2zi5uvq7jm21.png?width=240&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=04f85c381905ffbfcd0a964a179eda591b95d89d\n\n**Instructions**\n\nLie on your side with knees bent at 90.You can place a towel under the head for support.Place the bottom hand on the knees and press lightly to make sure they stay on the ground.With the top hand, reach for your ribs and pull gently as you rotate the torso.Hold the position for the required time and repeat following guidelines.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** 3 x a day | **Duration:** lay on right side only | **Hold:** 15\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 5 Passive ROM Extension\n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45wkr5ur7jm21.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f06c6095c95681c90dc726b490f007e5050be40e\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3acvoxks7jm21.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=46f994a1c9e9d13f7b8db3d62b99f6f5c71decdb\n\n**Instructions**\n\nLie on your stomach with your chin tucked-in.Place hands at approximately shoulder height and bring leg out in to a figure 4 pattern.While keeping the hips and legs on the table, press trunk upward with armswhile relaxing abdominals and buttocks.Slowly return to neutral position and repeat.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** 3 x a day | **Duration:** right leg to side | **Hold:** 2 secs\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 6 Leg glide in supported 45 \n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvhcpq0d8jm21.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f7d799560ac46b851194c763e2be668d07881d27\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u37d2wyt7jm21.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0fdee24ad26b00e8f5ea35e3057a2ce2fcfd1b0e\n\n**Instructions**\n\nLie on your back with the affected leg straight and supported in an elevated positionat a 30 to 45  angle.Pull the toes up toward you, to flex the foot on the elevated leg.

This will be the starting position.Keeping the foot relaxed, extend the knee without moving the thigh.When the knee is extended at its most, actively pull the toes toward your shin. When you reach the point where you feel a pulling sensation along your leg, let go and return to the starting position and repeat.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** 3 x a day\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had pain in the lower right side, So i had a preference side. These exercise help focus on the injured side. The goal is to centralize the pain and push it from the legs back up to the lower back.\n\nWith these exercises I focused on doing this 2 to 3 times a day. 10 reps for each exercise, holding for 15 seconds each.I did this for about 2 months straight and I've been introducing my own stretches (this is where you need to experiment and find what helps).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MODIFICATIONS**\n\nFor example here were my changes (be careful since everyone is different). Do these at your own risk\n\n**1 Flexion**\n\nIn the flexion exercise, I had my pain on the right side, so I would push my hip to the left. I modified this exercise, and instead of using the wall after I got used to it, I went more extreme and stood straight up and bent without the wall hoping to bend further.\n\nWhat the flexion exercise does (at least my understanding of it) is that it sets your back straight in order for you to proceed with the other stretches.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2 Active ROM Rotation**\n\nI did this unchanged throughout the whole time until in March 2019 where i did this on the end of a couch or bed so my legs can drop further and i used my arms to pull it further down and thats when you really hear your back crack. I dont recommend this until you are almost healed since I dont know what effects it will have before then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3 Single knee to chest**\n\nI did these with double knee to chest once I felt comfortable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4 thoracic stretch**\n\nNo changes\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5 Passive Rom Extension.**\n\n**There are many variations of this i did.**\n\nA) First i followed the instructions. I believe the knee bend is to focus on the right side of your back.\n\nB1) Some modifications I did was not to bend any legs. Once you are comfortable with both of those you can try some of the other modification\n\nB2) another stretch I tried was just lying face down and fully relaxing and see if your back hurts. Try this again but with knees bent about 90 degrees, then try to tilt it to the left or right.  I use this as a test to see if there's any improvements after these modified stretches.\n\nC) I had my wife sit on my back and push down near the pelvic area, since I noticed my body lifting when I'm doing these extensions. With her keeping my pelvic on the floor i was able to stretch the back more. **This would be probably one of the more useful exercises with my wife sitting down**. It gave me more movement and less pain. I kept pushing this exercise. I felt pain, but its not like a bad pain, more like a sore pain, (hard to explain), but I was able to push more and further each time. It was hard but helpful.\n\nD1) This modification is where i had my chest and neck **on the floor** and my lower body on the ball and I've asked my wife to lift my legs and bend it towards my head, this was uncomfortable, difficult and painful. below is the closest picture I can find, i apologize for the unclear picture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mxinxkiw7jm21.png?width=183&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f861574a8c49754b1c8503f2337305e641fa5585\n\nD2) At the same time as C's I used an exercise ball (really large one, larger than the picture below) and I did the following. I lay on my back and the ball was large enough that my legs barely touching the floor. I would roll the ball back and use my arms to balance my body and let my lower body/legs dangle, fully relaxed. I would lift both legs up balancing with my arms then drop both my legs down fully relaxed to really stretch it out. (I caution when trying this, it may cause injury if done incorrectly.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kflog57f8jm21.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=04e8f093e8070c2f7623bae10908ec2ab38cd6e3\n\nE) Once my wife was on a business trip and wasn't able to aid me, I was able to conjure up another method of this stretch.  I tried the camel pose, please see below. It was too difficult for me to do. So I did this at my bed room doorway but I had a broom stick placed across the door frame and place it around my pelvic area height-wise. Then i leaned back and stretched. **This modification was another exercise that allowed me to see great improvements.** . Be careful as the broom might snap, and it did damage my door frame by rubbing some paint off. I was able to achieve great flexibility with this exercise and it helped with a lot of the pain. I would say the base exercise gets you ready and modification C and E was the most impactful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzp1m41y7jm21.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8413c97ee5a87fce687afc940977fb5320db897a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nF) After I did the broom stick stretch (above), I started to do the camel pose properly, I still can't do it, but I'm working on it. The key is to try to relax your back and let it drop.\n\nG) The final modification was similar to Step D1\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/adav58xg8jm21.png?width=183&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=30d3eb94e5022d0dff0e6a1b9b9ebfed82d5eceb\n\nWhere instead of a ball i rested my legs on a couch and would try to let my body reach the ground. The key is let your back fully relax and drop. this is hard to explain, but try to be as limp as possible. I tried placing my upper body on the floor and letting it droop and relax and breathe in and out to make sure it gets a full natural stretch.\n\nI found that the stretches in the earlier stages used more muscles to force you into that position, but i still felt there could be improvements from the pain. I am still doing this exercise till this data (march 2019). I let everything relax and let my legs rest on the couch and i feel the tightness, and soreness on the back. This allowed me to slowly stop using the back support belt when sitting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**step 6 and 7 in the physio guide**\n\nI didn't really do them since i was in too much pain, and when i started to mod my stretches, i was able to move more, and flexibility and strength came back and didn't require to do these at all. But if you find them helpful, please continue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Jan- Feb**\n\nRest with minimal stretches . At this point there is some discomfort and would hurt if i sat too long or took too big of a step, too sudden of a movement. But during this period I would say i have had major improvements after the 3 months of constant stretching and testing. My right leg muscles have atrophied but I slowly started walking and doing more which built it back up.\n\nAlso during this time, Not sure if I got lazy or if i found resting at this point made some improvements. I tend to have rested a lot and stretched twice a week, down from 3 times a day.\n\nI also used back support belt when sitting since sitting still gave pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**March**\n\nStarted to feel even better and do not require a back support belt. I did further Customized stretches. Which I explained above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAt this point, there is still a bit discomfort when sitting too long, but thats about it. I'm trying to continue these stretches to make sure my back is nice and flexible. I haven't tried to lift anything too heavy with my back yet. I will naturally ease into this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Take aways from**\n\nChiro - not helpful, the belt was a bit helpful during Jan/Feb.\n\nPhysio- Find the right one that knows what they are talking about, do your own research\n\nAcupuncture - Good way to divert the pain and numb it and allows you to rest and for you to do other things such as stretch and sleep.\n\nMassage Therapist - Not too helpful, but got the idea of soaking in hot/warm water to promote blood flow and recovery\n\nDoctor - gives drugs out, those can help you sleep, but I would recommend try to minimize this. The less drugs you have the more you are able to determine what you need to do to improve instead of just numbing the pain.\n\nSpine assessment clinic - too late for surgery.\n\nStretches - Test, experiment, be careful, know your limit, have someone there helping you if you need.customize on what makes you feel better. But do educated research so you aren't injuring yourself more\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: clarified the meds on the post."""

Advil rash,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/xy970p/allergies_rant_so_tired_holy_crap/,b'Allergies rant - So tired holy crap',,"b""I have not slept much since autumn started. Autumn is my favourite season, and I've been able to enjoy it with no allergies at all in the past but something is different now and everything I've tried has been completely useless. I have full blown hay fever nearly everyday - it always gets worse at night or even if I'm just going to take a nap. It's like my body is allergic to sleep. I read that the body produces more histamine when you're sleepy, so I guess it is in a weird way sort of true.\n\nThis week has been brutal. I've been so exhausted to the point that I've lost entire days to being too tired to do anything but nap and sneeze. But there is no relief. Every time I go to bed I wake up in the night or early morning sneezing and extremely allergic. Everyday I have been taking two reactine extra strength allergy pills and two extra strength Advil, because ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory med so I figure it must do something for allergies. I also recently started getting serious about taking my Avamys nasal spray everyday. This combo seems to work but the allergies never completely go away, they only die down to being the normal mild allergies I used to have back when I didn't have any allergies. Absolutely everything itches including my skin and my scalp. I had a weird hivey rash on my neck this summer and mild allergy symptoms a few weeks before the severe hay fever kicked in. I feel like that rash was an omen of things to come. But it could have been unrelated.\n\nI have no solution to this right now. I might try to go to the doctor but it seems futile. I've suffered with this for years, some years much worse than others. My allergies were practically non-existent for most of the 2010s, and I want those years back. God damn. I feel like maybe it was also better because I was more diligent about using my nasal spray. I became careless and my doctor did not inform me I needed to take it regularly for it to be effective. I know now thanks to the internet that it does in fact need to be taken everyday for it to be helpful and same for allergy pills. You cannot skip a day with these things. So I will just do that and pray it works."""

Unfortunately I developed GI issues and had other side effects, causing me to quit usage after 3 months.\n\nIm now almost 29 and Im at a complete loss. Ive tried many different ingredients and topicals and my skin is extremely sensitive. \n\nFor the past year, the routine that my dermatologist has me on is Vanicream gentle cleanser, Tret, Vanicream daily hydration moisturizer and spf (I use Supergoop glow screen because its the only thing that doesnt break me out.) She also recommended 2-3 sessions of Diamond Glow facial. I did my first Diamond Glow a month ago and it didnt seem to do much of anything. The esthetician went over my lips during the facial and now my lips have been constantly peeling on the top and bottom. They also swelled up one day like they were reacting to something. My dermatologist said she thinks I have lip excema. Needless to say, I dont really care to do another Diamond Glow. \n\nIm at a loss and am looking for other opinions on what the best path / treatment plan is for my skin. Ive had no luck finding people who struggle with similar forehead scarring and any possible treatment. I should also note that I do not pick at or touch active acne besides throwing on a pimple patch, my skin just scars incredibly easily. What are your thoughts?'"

Please help me, I am desperate'",,"b'I\'m getting (what I call) ""pressure"" headaches every day as well, and I fucking hate them. They\'re low-key making me miserable. I take aspirin and tylenol like candy legit every day. Went to a walk-in clinic and all they said was ""you\'re fine, it\'s stress."" No high blood pressure....nada. I originally thought the headaches were from sinus issues, and/or allergies, so I\'ve used a Neti pot a lot...it does seem to help a little, but I\'m not 100% sure that\'s not a placebo effect. :|\n\nI work in IT, so I\'m on multiple screens all day every day (who isn\'t these days though?). I tried some blue-light filtering glasses...they seemed to help a *little*. However, I left them at the office and was unable to retrieve them before lockdown started a few weeks ago. :/\n\nGoing to a new GP tomorrow, hopefully it helps. I\'ll post back with what he says, but could really use any and all help this sub can provide. TIA all, very much!  \n\n**Update 1**: Went to my new GP this morning. He said that due to the location of the pain (always above my left eye) it sounds like **neuropathy**. I\'m going to have a MRI done in the next couple weeks or so. For now, he gave me an Rx for Nabumetone (2x a day) and Topiramate (only to be taken after a week if the first Rx isn\'t cutting it). edit: never ended up taking the Topiramate as the side-effects sounds potentially horrible. I had an MRI & CT Scan (""Cat Scan"") done, but the GP said they were inconclusive. :| I am glad, however, that nothing serious was found! \n\n**Update 2:** Finally saw an EN&T Doc yesterday. I have a deviated septum from breaking my nose when I was a teenager. He *thinks* this *could* be the cause of my headaches since the bones in my nose were shifted over to the left and the ""pressure"" (and pain from the headaches) is consistently above my left eye. ***However***, he said the corrective surgery is a ""50/50 shot"" for helping with the headaches, which is a joke to me....I\'m not going to have a surgery if the odds are not better than 50/50! Really quite disappointed in how inconclusive and wishy-washy this doctor was. He even looked at the MRI and CT Scans, and that\'s the best he could do. \n\n**Update 3:** I\'ve noticed that **eating seems to be a headache trigger** for me, but as of yet I can\'t identify what food/s. I am keeping a food diary and so far pizza and an Asian noodle bowl have been the worst offenders. As silly as it might sound, I\'m *thinking* **gluten** is the commonality there. Also, I have noticed that the [Wim Hof breathing technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tybOi4hjZFQ) actually provides some pretty effective pain relief! I may have to go to a Neurologist if I can\'t find some relief otherwise.'"
NSAID swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/p592pk/this_is_so_long_and_im_so_sorry_going_on_14_years/,"b""This is so long, and I'm so sorry! Going on 14 years with no clue here. Any ideas?""",,"b'So, in short, one morning when I was 16, I rolled over and woke up to awful nausea. My body has kind of just been getting worse since, and me and my doctors are.... clueless here. I just don\'t know anymore. I\'ve likely been to 15+ doctors, and everything has caught up to me so much that I can barely function anymore. I don\'t really know how to communicate how bad it is to doctors because it seems like they think I\'m saying I\'m a bit nappy. I\'m not just nappy, this is crippling.\n\nI never know how much to include or trim out, but I\'ll try to condense everything and trim out smaller details. So, please feel welcome to ask any question in case I got that ratio wrong! I\'ve read enough health websites that I\'m pretty tolerant to suggestion now. If I\'m not sure, I\'m not sure, and I\'m more likely to forget I have a symptom than overstate it. (This came up recently; a doctor asked if I had a symptom, and when I said I wasn\'t sure, he basically told me I didn\'t because I\'d know if I did. I asked my husband later and he said, yeah, he could tell I was visibly struggling with that symptom.)\n\nI am a woman, 30 today! I am about 170 lb, 5\'4"", mixed American mutt--23andme thinks Mexican and UK. I\'m in Colorado, USA. \n\n***Current Diagnoses***\n\n* POTS\n   * This is way better with better recommendations on salt and electrolyte intake. It\'s not perfect, but it\'s doable. I generally go up a flight of stairs without rolling onto the floor! Honestly, while I accept this can be a cause of massive crash days after, say, a hike or a hot weather mid-day 5 mile walk, I really wouldn\'t bother complaining much about this now that I now what to do when I\'m feeling floppier than normal.\n* GERD and bile reflux\n* PCOS?\n   * None of my tests or ultrasounds came back off, but my body was being wacky, so my gynecologist at the time called it PCOS and put me on meds.  Over the years, I haven\'t really related to any telling PCOS symptoms other people with PCOS complain about. My new gynecology office\'s first comment was, ""You don\'t have PCOS, though, you don\'t have any of the signs."" So, this one is iffy for me. My non-PCOS-focused birth control they put me on works just as well for my issues I was having. But I\'m just happy it works! (Long, heavy periods that eventually became continuous; painful periods; super irregular periods; random weird body stuff, like growing 2 cup sizes in a month when I was 24, etc.)\n\n***Current Medication***\n\n* Junel (combination birth control), continuous, living the no-hemorrhage-week lifestyle since \\~2014 or 2015ish and continuous since \\~2019.\n* Iron supplements, on and off (dropped to 30 and is now back to my doctor\'s goal range of 80\'s)\n* I take multivitamins, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin D when I need to feel like I\'m doing something\n* Fish oil (this one is daily since it sounds like it\'s most effective that way and harmless when not helpful) \n\n***Symptoms***\n\n>*General*\n\n* Fatigue that\'s gotten progressively worse\n   * I have to plan to rest most of the day if I, say, go get groceries, especially if I try to tack on additional errands. Everything starts to get wobbly and hard to follow and my body gets weak until I sit down and I just fall right asleep. It feels like I go from normal to ""3 weeks without sleep"" in an hour or two of work. If I do more, I\'m tapping into reserves, and I pay for it.\n* Body aches that feel bone deep\n   * I recently had really sore muscles and the aches simultaneously; when I went to take a shower, I noticed the warmth really soothed my muscles but didn\'t seem to touch those aches. It was really distinct in that moment. I just don\'t know what it is. They aren\'t phased by warmth, cold, movement, pain killers, NSAID\'s, turmeric, etc. I drink rarely, but my brain either spaces them out or feel a bit better when I\'ve had alcohol, so that one pain killer has been effective.\n   * These are most intense around my arms and shins (around the humerus and tibia), especially near the top of those areas. When they\'re more intense, they skip over my elbows/knees and seem to ache through the next long bone.\n   * They are not affected by movement, but they are worsened with anything not resting, kinda like having the flu.\n   * I got super, super sick around 2014 or 2016, I think it was? I didn\'t notice I was sick because the symptoms weren\'t as bad. I eventually began to catch on when my windpipe, lungs, tonsils, ears, sinuses, and tonsils were inflamed. It didn\'t actually click until I lost my voice entirely. My fever was so high I was heating our entire hotel bed. I just thought I was in the early stages of a flare and refluxing. I was told these symptoms didn\'t exist, so I just... ignored them. :c\n* I don\'t know where to put this one, but I get a really, really intense urge to pee when I lie on my left side.\n   * I think this has been around for a few years, but I had no idea what was happening. I just kept waking up needing to pee. As it\'s gotten worse recently, I realized it happens every time I\'m on my left side, and is greatly relieved by standing up, walking around, going pee, or just rolling over onto my right side. It is mildly agitated on my back, but if I\'m really determined, I can ignore that level. I\'m so tired of lying on my right side, though. I dread sleeping because it\'s not comfortable to wake up every time I roll over in my sleep. But since I\'ve made the effort to sleep on my right side, my mysterious issue where I wake up needing to pee after 15 minutes of sleep has disappeared.\n* Tremors (hands, legs)\n   * These can start anytime I\'m upright and doing anything. If I add exertion and heat to the mix, they\'re very visible. A little caffeine seems to settle them, and of course, an overdose of caffeine is... not helpful.\n* ***new*** Little bumps across my abdomen\n   * I found my first little pinhead bump around April, it\'s near the outer edge of my ribs just over my stomach. At the time, my stomach was so sensitive that it was painful to wear a shirt and walk down stairs. When I found it, it was so sensitive, I\'d immediately feel like throwing up and passing out, so I\'d let it go. For the next few days, I\'d feel really unwell. This one has remained roughly the same size; it\'s not as sensitive as it was when I found it, but I still feel unwell when if I accidentally give it a good poke. I have another one in a similar spot near the other side of my ribs, but it only hurt when it first came out.\n   * Many hurt in the area when they first come out. They don\'t hurt themselves unless they really get probed; they mostly hurt the area around them. I usually just feel some ouching and tenderness when I poke the area, then a few hours later, I\'ll feel the pinhead. It\'ll eventually grow into a little lump.\n   * They are hard, some are moveable.\n   * They\'re coming in more and more quickly now. Some are only palpable when I\'m lying down, some when I\'m standing, some when I haven\'t eaten, some when I have. If I catch them at the right hour, my stomach feels like a bean bag. But I don\'t really know how to get someone else to feel them. I know where they are and the angle to hit them at to feel them because my subconscious is telling me about them \\*constantly,\\* like that ready-to-go scab you absentmindedly pick off even though you didn\'t know you had a scratch to begin with. It\'s like my subconscious is trying to tell me about them. I never would\'ve found half of them if I wasn\'t focused on something else entirely, then suddenly realized my hand was poking at one.\n   * Most of these aren\'t visible so far, only the swelling.\n* My right collarbone swole up one day around March. I put my hoodie on in the morning, and when I took it off at night, it was swollen. \n   * It hasn\'t changed much. It doesn\'t really hurt. It is the length of the bone. So, I thought it must be the costrochondritis buddy that effects collarbones, so I thought I\'d give it a couple months. I can\'t tell if it\'s changed, but it absolutely has not gotten any better. I don\'t have any sensitivities  or tenderness described in the articles on the collarbone inflammation types, including the costrochondritis.\n\n>Respiratory\n\n* ***new*** Difficulty breathing lying down\n   * I think this has been around for a bit, but I always wrote it off as issue with reflux. Now that it\'s more severe, it\'s obvious it\'s unrelated. It does not respond to reflux care and feels, somehow, different than when reflux rubs a nerve wrong.\n\n>Gastrointestinal\n\n* Nausea\n   * Some of my nausea isn\'t too bad, but I\'ll get nausea when I take a bite of a food that is a warning; if I eat more, I\'ll be in a bad place. If I proceed anyway, I can be severely nauseated for days but won\'t throw up. I had food poisoning for the first time last year, and it was the first time I\'d ever just... thrown up. I\'m still in awe. It was so, so easy. The nausea was so low level I almost didn\'t notice it and originally had to swallow it down because I had no idea the nausea meant anything, and it was there for just a short bit before the action. Then I just... felt better. It\'s something I have always heard people complain about, but if I had food poisoning instead of my food nausea every time, I\'d honestly be living an easier life.\n* Low appetite\n   * I\'ve been trying to stick to fist size or smaller meals once or twice a day, no snacks, or my appetite and nausea get really out of whack. They\'re small enough portions that it wigs people out to see. This has been more of an issue this past year. While my weight has been stable, I\'m fairly certain that some calorie watching (I don\'t have the energy to weigh out my jalapenos) has me under 1200, even when I\'m rounding up, on days where I feel like I\'m eating too much. Yet my stomach keeps growing.\n* Reflux\n   * I\'ve recently read an article that reflux that agitates your windpipe and can go up to your nostrils and ear canals isn\'t GERD but LPR? Mine usually gets those areas. If it hits elsewhere, I generally don\'t feel it.\n* My stomach won\'t stop growing. I have swelling where my left ribs become my stomach, and it\'s gotten so big it started having a little roll. I have some swelling like it starting on the right side of my right ribs. I feel really gross and huge.\n   * I feel like I should eat less, but I also feel like I need to eat super calorie dense to make it through the day when I\'m struggling to get portions down. I\'ve had days where it feels like my brain is just tilted sideways and won\'t turn on until I finally convince my body to take a little food. These bouts have not caused any weight loss. This is really messing with me, guys. I\'ve had a few mini breakdowns over trying to figure out how to navigate this. \n   * I got down to 150 a couple years ago before it just started inching back up and will not go down unless I\'m netting 700 or fewer calories or less a day, which obviously isn\'t sustainable. If I rebound back to \\~1200 calories a day, the weight comes back like it was water weight. It\'s stupidly frustrating. My eating habits, however, never rebounded; my sensitivity to fats and sweets has only gotten more severe. I naturally eat lower calorie food in smaller portions than I did while religiously counting on MFP.\n* We once thought I had ulcers. We\'ve never found one, so at this point, we don\'t think that\'s what\'s going on. My stomach is a little sensitive all the time. When I lie super flat on my back, I get intense, sharp pains in that left corner of my stomach, so I generally side-sleep to minimize GI symptoms and this pain.\n\n***Tests I\'ve had***\n\n* Endoscopies (multiple; most recent in May showing bile reflux)\n* Colonoscopy (including biopsies for IBS, Crohn\'s, celiac\'s, etc.; all negative)\n* Feces test (normal)\n* HIDA scan of gallbladder (said it was a bit low but not abnormal and not a source of my symptoms)\n* Ultrasounds of gallbladder only (normal)\n* Ultrasound of abdomen last Wednesday (showed gallbladder sludge, no signs of stones)\n* Autoimmune screening such as ANA, sedimentation, etc. (all normal)\n* Blood panels such as metabolic and CBC\'s (normal)\n* Thyroid likes to jump a little sometimes, but has only once in 10+ years jumped over 2.0, and wiggled its way back down to 1.6 when we monitored it.\n* Reproductive hormone panels (normal)\n* Urine tests (normal)\n* ECG, EKG, Zio patch last summer (normal)\n* Stress test last fall (heart rate went really high and it ended early)\n* Brain MRI (2018 for post-concussive headaches; normal)\n* Heart MRI (\\~2014 or 2015; normal)\n\n ***Some things I\'ve tried***\n\n* Went to a therapist specializing in physiological symptoms caused by psychological sources Jan 2020-\\~Octish 2020; she determined I have no signs of depression or anxiety, have healthy coping mechanisms, and didn\'t find a connection between my symptoms and mental state. She concluded I wouldn\'t benefit from further sessions. \n   * This one stings to be dismissed so frequently because I went hoping this was missing the link here. It felt empowering that working on that missing link could set me free from this. I\'ve spent so long managing my mental health that it sounded so easy and doable. I also spent many hours looking through every therapist in the area to make sure I was looking at someone who really had an interest in this topic and could help me really dig into it, and she did. We spent hours talking about the hardest parts of my life and how they impacted me and what I took from them and what I put aside from them. It was a dead end; I don\'t have resentment and anger from any of it. It was nice to talk, though.\n* Gluten free\n   *  My husband was diagnosed with celiacs last year, so I actually eat GF most of the time to avoid CC\'ing him. I really, really promise I don\'t feel worse when I do dip into regular celiac-killing soy sauce. \n* Dairy free\n* I eat corn, soy, rice, etc. on rotations, so I\'ll occasionally pick one and intentionally avoid it. I haven\'t noticed a change off or on them. I really don\'t seem to react to foods unless it\'s fake sweetener, which seems entirely normal, or my trigger foods (fatty, super sweet, alcohol, etc).\n* Talking to a dietician (\\~2014)\n   * She said I seemed to have a really good handle on nutrition and healthy outlook on foods, portions, cooking, etc. I think I\'ve only gotten better and better at it since then, even when I am craving something really not-good. For example, I have stopped taking ""personal watermelon"" personally.\n* I eat protein!  I intentionally seek protein and fiber out as my top sources of nutrition.\n   * I really get this one a lot, especially because I must pass on most things you\'ll see at a barbecue.\n* I eat less sugar than people watching their sugar because, well, it really agitates my body. I will admit some post-cookie-nausea has gotten me through some low-cal periods in my life.\n* Monitoring for healthy sleeping habits\n* Forcing myself to exercise\n* Getting super depressed while on tricyclic antidepressants; the relief I felt off of them helps reassure me that I\'m not depressed and don\'t know it\n* Vitamin D and sunbathing\n* Willing the unfindable anxiepresson away\n* Trying every pill they suggest until I give up because (a) it\'s expensive and not affecting my symptoms or (b) causing side effects on the ""call your doctor immediately"" list.\n* Developing a potentially real addiction to Gaviscon as of 2020.\n* Asking the internet (most recently, this post)\n\nI may have missed something, so again, please feel free to ask any questions! I\'ll update this post with any details anyone requests.\n\nRight now, I\'m at a point where I went about the lumps in my stomach and difficulty breathing overnight. They told me it must be viral and will go away, but they\'d do an ultrasound. The ultrasound came back with sludge, so they said that would cause my symptoms so wait and see if it gets worse so they can do further workups on my gallbladder if it does.\n\nI\'m due for a follow-up with my latest gastroenterologist who, in our first and only visit so far, has recommended I do a CAT scan on my abdomen. \n\nI am just so tired of going in for tests to come back normal and being told I just don\'t know I\'m anxious, and should really deal with my unmitigated undiagnosed anxiety. It\'s really, really messing with me. I keep trying to will away my symptoms or force a narrative that they only appear when I\'m stressed when I damn well know that isn\'t it. I just want to know if there\'s anything I should go in armed with. I feel so defeated but I can\'t be because I\'m running out of strength to pretend this all isn\'t happening. I need help.\n\nIf you\'ve made it all the way, thank you so much, it means the world to get any opinions. Thank you so much!'"
penicillin rash,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/11fhf8g/please_help_possible_amoxicillin_allergy/,b'Please help! - possible amoxicillin allergy',,"b'Hello, \nI have quite a few questions regarding my 1 year old daughter and I hope someone can provide some clarity. I have asked 2 pharmacists roughly the same questions but looking for more confirmation from allergists/people who suffer from this\n\nContext:\nMy daughter was prescribed a 5 day course of amoxicillin for an ear and chest infection on 7th of Feb. She had 1 dose that evening, another dose in the morning (8th of feb) and one at lunch time. This is the first time she has needed an antibiotic. Upon bathing her, I noticed bruising to her ears (where the GP held them to look inside) and her feet and ankles began to swell with really quite blue bruising to the top, in between toes, ankles and sole of her feet. She very regularly grabs these areas and bashes her ankles together with force and kicks her feet off the ground while she is lying down. I took her straight to A&E in a worry as she has never had a bruise before and there was no possible way this could have been inflicted and she is not yet mobile.\nWhile in hospital, more bruising of different sizing appeared to the back of her calves, knee, elbow, top of her arm, veins at the palms of her hand and the vein behind one of knees in the crease. All these bruises appeared at different stages during the night and whenever a different nurse checked her over. She started to develop lots of little purple/red spots to her legs, her arms and knees started to swell and her eczema patches became very red. The bruising started off so blue that one of the nurses tried scrubbing it off thinking it was ink or dye from her clothes. She continued to grab and bash her feet and ankles together causing the bruises to become worse. There was absolutely no tenderness or pain where any of the bruises were. \nNumerous tests were done such as x-rays, CT, and an extensive blood test checking platelets, organ function etc. But nothing appeared on anything. The hospital continued to give her amoxicillin and I am unsure if any more bruising appeared. I saw her on day 6/7? (13th of feb) after taking the first dose and all bruising, spots and swelling had gone apart from little green-coloured areas where the bruising was on her veins. The whole of her face where she did not have eczema was peeling/flaking and had clearly been moisturised. I saw her again on 17th of feb and she had an untextured, really red rash consisting of lots of little spots covering her whole stomach which she had never had before. The skin on her face was also back to normal. \nThe dr never considered the amoxicillin. After researching myself and going into a pharmacy and requesting a leaflet that comes with amoxicillin, I am beginning to realise she may of had a very rare reaction or side effects to it - leaflet states all these symptoms as a 1 in 10,000 chance. \n\nQuestions:\n1. Does this sound like a reaction? Or side effects? I am unsure of the difference.\n2. Would these reactions/side effects alter any results on an extensive blood test?\n3. Can this allergy be found in a blood test if not looking for it?\n4. If this is an allergy, how can she be tested for it? (Skin prick, specific blood test, etc?)\n5. If she takes amoxicillin again, what are the chances she has the same reaction? \n6.Are drug allergy symptoms different every time? Or is there a risk of her going into anaphylaxis the next time she takes it?\n7. Would this be an allergy of penicillin or just amoxicillin? (If it is an allergy or just side effects)\n8. If not an allergy, is there any safe way to prove these are side effects of amoxicillin?\n9. Does the timeframe of doses of amoxicillin and the timeframe of the symptoms fit with a reaction?\n\nAnymore information you can think of regarding the situation would be highly appreciated.\nThank you for taking the time to read this very long post! Please help a desperate mother looking for answers.'"

Told I\'m too young to have issues, probably related to bedrest from pregnancies and my weight. Lethargy increases. Teeth begin cracking. Struggle to get to sleep. 36 hour days start.

Doc felt if Ambien is treating it, we could stop there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 29, endometriosis gets severe enough to require partial **hysterectomy (ovaries intact)**. **B12 deficiency** discovered later in year. OTC prescribed. **Back pain** begins. First laser ablation of nerves in lower back. Helps greatly. Norco for breakthrough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 30, diagnosed **anxiety and depression**. Buspar and Lexapro prescribed. Lethargy doesn\'t change. Bruising seems to get easier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 31, **ADHD**. Due to Norco prescription, I eschew Ritalin and go with Strattera - non-stim treatment, trying to minimize interacting effects of meds. Felt no symptoms, but PCP heard some lung funkiness and ordered a CT. Lung CT reveals **pneumonia and partially collapsed lower left lung.

Laser ablation on back again, after it gave out bending over to pick up a cake out of bottom fridge shelf. Food intake reduced to twice a day. Mild itchy, very very light red, very very tiny bumps, rash begins on back. Moles continue to increase across shoulders and back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 33, my mid-range vocals begin to disappear. Raspy, scratchy. I attribute to smoking, but it seemed odd I\'d keep soprano and tenor notes, but lose alto. Ankle begins swelling, locking more often. Another ablation on lower back. Food intake once a day, but still no weight loss. Major dental surgery, 2nd molars removed. Again ask two docs (back and PCP) about ankle, told I\'m ""too young to have major problems"". **Rash** gets treatment with Voltaren. Improves some, but it still comes back in waves today. **Migraines** get so severe that I\'m down every week, and a few times a month, lasting 2-3 days. Prescribed **Amitriptilyn**. This med has worked well for a few years, increased dose 6 months ago. Working well again. Dropped Lexapro since Amitriptilyn is another anti-depressant. Maybe 2-3 times a month I add on Excedrin. Developed **prism** in eyesight. Eyes begin to jump like I\'m being shaken if I try to focus for more than a few minutes on a close project, like knitting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 34, begin falling when ankle completely gives out. Ask back doc if my gait is a problem. Insists it\'s not. I demand an MRI anyway. **Osteochondritis Dissecans** found.  Osteochondral Allograft Transplantation (OATs) done using cartilage from side of talus. Denovo denied by insurance. After 4 months, I drop 40 lbs in next 4 months, while on limited walking ability due to the OATs surgery. Same eating patterns as before, once a day.  Weight loss stops. Lethargy increases.

It\'s still purple and only now just started yellowing.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooked into surrogacy for a girl. Labs and exam reveal I\'m near menopause, I\'ve only a few follicles left. Doc notes that even with my medical history and hysterectomy, it\'s still very early to be getting these results.

Last 3 days, clear mucus goes with diarrhea, usually a ""sputter"" when I\'d only intended to urinate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the last 2 months or so, I don\'t even want to drink anything. I don\'t get nauseated or gag reflex issues from intake, I just really, really don\'t want anything. Yet, I still continue to maintain at 200lbs, even with mild exercise added in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI continue to hear from various docs and PCP that I\'m ""too young"" to have any real big problems, so ""let\'s just wait and see if it resolves"".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current symptoms: diarrhea, nausea, migraines, restlessness, lethargy, joint pain, joint failure, back pain, insomnia, thin nails, jumping eyes, continued tooth degradation, vitamin deficiency, hormone deficiency, random shortness of breath, heart skips a beat once or twice a week while resting, force feeding and drinking, consistently varying - but always high - WBC, right ear pain and blocked sound.**\n\nMy FitBit tells me that my resting heart rate is also on the increase.

penicillin swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/11paou7/worried_about_swelling/,b'Worried About Swelling',,"b""Started having tooth pain on a crowned tooth last weekend. Pain became intense and saw my dentist Tuesday. He gave me Penicillin and referred me to an endodontist I've been to befofe for a root canal. The soonest appointment they had was Friday the next week (17th.)\n\nI was managing pain with ibuprofen and Tylenol together until that stopped working. Missed 2 days of work due to intense pain at night and not being able to sleep. Called my dentist and asked for something for the pain, he gave me 8 hydrocodone to tide me over.\n\nFriday morning I started to see some swelling on my neck that was noticable to other people. By Saturday morning the swelling had grown a lot. I had been on the penicillin four days and it seemed to obviously not be working. Went into an emergency dentist, he prescribed Z-Pak and 800mg Ibuprofen. Gave me a referral to a different endodontist to see if I can get in sooner. Said to go to the ER if the swelling started to affect my breathing, but they seemed to think the swelling was pretty normal, which relieved me a bit. \n\nHowever, my swelling is continuing to increase, and now the left side of the bottom of my mouth is starting to swell up, swallowing is becoming more difficult, and I've been drooling the last time I slept. Pain is intolerable until I take a hydrocodone with the ibuprofen. I only have one left because most providers don't like to prescribe that stuff now. I was trying to ration it as much as possible for night only but the pain is very intense.\n\nI only took the first dose of 2 Z-Pak a little over 12 hours ago. I know it will take time for the new antibiotics to start working, but I am worried due to the swelling continuing to increase. I don't want to be that guy that googles stuff and self diagnoses, but I am worried about Ludwigs Angina due to all of the swelling being the underside of my neck and now the fact that underneath my tongue is starting to swell. I know it is rare, but I am pretty freaked out due to how bad the swelling is (never had anything like this happen before, and this is far from my first tooth infection.)\n\nMy wife is a nurse and wants to take me to the ER today, but the emergency dentist said not to do that until swelling makes breathing harder. I am scared to wait to that point but I also don't want to go just for them to tell me to go home and wait for the Z-Pak to work. Looking for some additional advice on this situation, since it's the weekend and I can't see my normal dentist.\n\nWill try to post a pic of the swelling. Thanks in advance for reading all of this.\n\nEdit: [Here](https://imgur.com/a/3Gd18LA) is a pic of my neck swelling."""
NSAID swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/12a0nxv/nsaids_and_sciatica/,b'NSAIDS and sciatica',,"b'I saw a post the other day asking about the use of NSAIDs and if we were hindering the bodies natural healing responses by reducing inflammation.   I had asked a similar question to my ortho awhile back about steroids and also NSAIDs in there role of helping with bulging or herniated discs.  Thought I would pass along what his take was.  \n\nInflammation is the bodies response to damage and to help bring healing factors to that site, however a disc out of its natural space isnt something that the body can heal in the traditional sense.   The disc material needs back in its space or in case of herniation the leaking material washed away.    In this case inflammation is hindering some of the discs ability to go back into the disc space.  By swelling it continues to protrude into the nerve space and as the nerve is pressed upon it continues sending distress signals causing something similar to a feedback loop.   The inflammation continues which is whats causing pressure on the nerve which is what causes the inflammation.    Steroid injections seek to stop this loop and NSAIDs can sometimes help enough to allow things to calm down for the disc to pull back towards the space it should be in.   He says they like to call it inflammation soup or stew.   Its a situation where the bodies natural responses are working in a way not really intended. Allergic reactions are an immune response but that doesnt mean that its a natural one working in an intended way.'"

Im 20, F, and around 135 pounds. I have so many random skin issues and every doctor I have been to says they are unrelated but I just cant fathom that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. For starters, Ive had seborrheic dermatitis since I was around 14 (have a whole bag of medication and nothing works, lately Ive learned if I sleep on wet hair my scalp basically turns to mush and scabs and bleeds like crazy. I've tried to wash it less and sleep with it dry and its helping more than any meds have.) \n2. Since I was 13/14 every 3 months probably I get this crazy rash of tiny tiny bumps around my lips. Its so painful and I have a cream (triamcinolone .1%) that will clear it up in about 3-4 days. Without it, it lasts around 2 weeks. If I can figure out how Ill insert some pics. Its not herpes, derm has said its a reaction from the sun mixed with Advil but I know thats not the case bc it has happened many times when I have not taken Advil or been in the sun. \n3. I have had shingles FIVE times. The first time was when I was 17 and the last time I got them was about 2 years ago. Theyve been on my legs and back. Never had chickenpox but dr says its from the chickenpox vaccine I had as a baby. Almost every time I get shingles I get thrush in my mouth and its horribly painful oh and in October I got my first yeast infection. \n4. This doesnt really apply but when I was 17 I got Zika after visiting Cuba and on my bday, I had thrush, shingles, and Zika all at once. \n5. Last year around this time I got pityriasis rosea. Mother patch started on my left ribcage and then tiny dots spread all over. \n6. I have pretty bad eczema, mainly on my arms (crease of elbow) and I use the same cream that I use on my lips and that helps. \n7. I am constantly getting random rashes that have no explanations. \n8. I have very very sensitive skin, new products constantly irritate it. \n\nSorry for such a long list but I had to include it all. I am pretty healthy, do yoga and am active. My only allergies are penicillin and I had a patch test appointment set up for this week but due to covid-19 it is not considered an essential so it was canceled. I feel like my skin is falling apart and it drives me crazy. Not celiac and have met with an immunologist who tested me for lots of autoimmune diseases and I dont have any.

I have been on isotrentinoin for about two months so far. My dermatologist started me on a very low dose because my skin was honestly not that bad; I have hormonal acne due to hormone therapy that is persistent but not super severe. I started on 5mg and was ok aside from nausea and dryness for two months. On the weekend, my dermatologist upgraded me to 10mg and I immediately started getting really sick. \n\nMy initial symptoms were severe nausea and pain in my head like there was pressure behind my eyes, then fatigue. Within three days I was barely able to move from chills and shaking, my body tremors were really bad. My eyes hurt and I was so dizzy I could barely stand up. I went to the doctor and they told me to immediately stop taking it, go home and rest and take NSAIDs and paracetamol. Ive done all that and I feel quite a bit better, but still incredibly fatigued and sore. All my joints and muscles hurt and I get tired so much more easily than I did a week ago. Has anyone else had this happen? Its really weird. I emailed my dermatologist and they said it might be a virus or something like that but I am sure its not COVID (I have tested negative) and I havent got any other virus symptoms. (Runny nose, sore throat, etc)\n\nHas anyone else had this happen? How long does it last?

Constant pain - Please help.',,"b'When I (35f) was 17 I had constant pain in a tooth on the upper left (I believe its #2). The dentist I saw couldnt find anything explicitly wrong though he said there may be a hairline fracture but the x ray wasnt conclusive. Due to the pain the tooth was extracted and I had an implant done. Years later in my late 20s the same thing happened on the parallel tooth on the upper right (I believe #15). There was nothing explicitly wrong but due to constant pain it was removed and I had an implant done. The dentist at the time (who has since retired) said it may be a genetic issue seeing as it was the same tooth just on opposite sides. \nI just had my second baby in January. About 4 weeks after my baby was born the implants started bothering me. The one on the left became loose and it was discovered that the implant failed so I had it removed and had a bone graft done. However, a problem remains on the right side. The pain is achey, mostly dull but overwhelming at times. It doesnt feel like sharp tooth pain like a cavity but rather an overall pain stemming from that area. It radiates behind my check above the tooth and up to my inner eye. I massage above my teeth/cheek and around my eye for relief along with taking Advil or Aleve to help with the pain. I dont want to keep taking medicine to help and Im feeling like the only option is to have this remaining implant removed, however its not failing which was confirmed when the other failed implant was identified. So removing this implant without a confirmed issue would feel like a huge waste of the time and money that went into it. Im hoping someone here can help with any suggestions as to what could be causing this or how I can address it. Thanks.'"

I don't have any medical conditions or history of dental issues that would be pertinent to this situation.\n\n[Heres a link](https://imgur.com/a/xCOj8d8) to the Imgur gallery where I've posted pertinent pictures.\n\nI've had tooth pain for a few weeks. Bottom left, far back molar. Sensitivity when I drink cold water, eat too hot foods, and pain when I put pressure on the tooth. \n\nI went to the dentist a week ago and they didn't see anything wrong, told me to get some Sensodyne to reduce sensitivity. I did, and had no improvement over the week. About 3-4 days ago, I noticed some bumps forming in the same general area as the pained tooth. So yesterday I went to the dentist again to have them look at it. The dentist was stumped, and referred me to an oral surgeon to see if they could figure out the problem. \n\nThe oral surgeon can't see me until Monday, and I had bad enough pain this morning that I took two Advil and applied a lot of oragel, and I took to the internet to see if I could figure out what it was on my own. I'm not usually the type to self-diagnose, I know to trust medical professionals but man I was desperate, in a lot of pain. \n\nLong story short, my symptoms seemed to point to a partially erupted transverse lingual paramolar. It just made sense: I have bumps in a pattern that seems similar to the crown of a small molar, it feels like teething pain, I poked one of the bumps with very pointy tweezers and it felt like poking a tooth, and my teeth on the left side seem to have shifted forward in my mouth a bit, as my left canine is more crooked than the right, and it used to not be crooked. \n\nI know paramolars are rare, but I have a buccal conical paramolar on tooth # 15 (I think, I might have the wrong number. Very back top left molar). So with pain around and behind tooth # 18 (very back, bottom left), I wondered if it was just a vertical symmetry thing, I have a spare tooth on the top left so maybe I'd grow one on the bottom left too. According to a study I found on the management of supernumerary teeth, it is rare but possible to have a supplemental paramolar between the first and second maxillary molars. I had my wisdom teeth, my first maxillary molars, removed, so a paramolar behind my farthest back tooth would be between the second maxillary molar and the space where the first maxillary molar would have been, had it not been extracted. \n\nSo I went back to the dentist and requested a copy of my x-rays. The close-ups didn't go back that far, but the panoramic didn't show anything in the area where I'm having pain. I told the dentist my theory, so they agreed to take another xray as far back in my mouth as possible, just to see if there was anything there that didn't show on the panoramic for some reason. \n\nThat close up doesn't show anything behind my # 18 molar. So now I'm stumped, the dentist is stumped, and I have to wait all weekend before I can go to the oral surgeon to see if they have any idea what it could be. \n\nWhat could be hard like a tooth, feels like teething and pressure on my other teeth, but not show up on x-rays? \n\nI'm attaching a picture of my paramolar on the top tooth in case that matters, as well as pictures of the bumps in question (as good as I could get by shoving my iPhone in my mouth, sorry it's not ideal) and the x-rays. \n\nAt this point I'm probably stuck just using oragel all weekend and waiting to meet with the surgeon anyway, but I figured I'd ask Reddit just in case anybody could identify the problem, so I could at least bring a theory to the surgeon now that my paramolar theory was shot down. \n\nIf you read all this, thank you for your time. And whether you read all of it or not, I hope you have a good day!"""
Advil problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/whfyef/im_finally_ready_to_acknowledge_my_adhd_and_now/,"b""I'm finally ready to acknowledge my ADHD, and now I'm having a hard time trying to deal with it""",,"b""I'm finally ready to acknowledge my ADHD, but I don't know what to do about it.\n\nFor context I know I have ADHD, I've known basically my whole life but I just tried to ignore it. I talk more about it on this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/vau04x/im_sick_of_my_family_treating_me_like_i_cant_do/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\nBut the TLDR of it is that I have always tried to ignore my ADHD and never acknowledged it and wrote it off as something that doesn't effect me and I can easily willpower myself into doing anything and I was being lazy and weak. This is a big part of the reason I have self esteem issues today, and why I started to see a therapist a little while ago. I was diagnosed since I was in about 1st grade and since then for most of my life I have struggled to maintain concentration and focus. This goes for school, work and activities I enjoy. Part of the reason I resisted all forms of help for my ADHD is that I thought it made me dumber than other people which is why I always just rejected the idea I had a disability.\n\nI'm at the point in my life now where I want to start being more independent and not rely on my  grandmother for things I can do on my own. But I can never seem to sit down and learn something. When I'm doing research, reading or even listening to something my mind goes to a million things at once, even when I'm invested in it. Even typing this out right now is taking forever because I keep losing focus on what I'm typing and get distracted by random thoughts about nothing.\n\n After talking to my therapist for a bit I came to the realization that I had to acknowledge that fact that I had ADHD. And if I want to get better and improve my life than I had to come to terms and start treating my ADHD.\n\nI want to start by saying I am very hesitant about medication, not completely 100% opposed to it just very hesitant. I'm a guy who has never liked the idea of taking things that can mess with my mind/body. I have never drank alcohol or smoked anything in my life and don't plan to, I don't even drink coffee or energy drinks either. Part of this is do to the fact that I don't want to be addicted to anything as I have an addictive personality and I don't want to have anything I can get addicted to that is bad for me. Even when I have headaches or any pain I almost never even take an advil unless I get a doctor's recommendation or if the pain is just unbearable. Another reason I  also never want to not be myself. I had a friend in high school who took medication for his ADHD. The few times that he didn't it was like he was like a whole other person, just very unhinged and excessive. I don't know if that will be me If i start medicating or who i will be when I'm on/off it and it scares me to think about it. Then again idk if my friend had others problems or if he needed other medication so he might be a different story. Also  if I get on medication will I need to take it all the time to maintain focus or will I forever have to rely on it.\n\nIf possible I'd like to sharpen my focus without medication. I have been trying meditation for the past couple of days but it has been challenging to say the least. Like it almost hurts my mind to try to stay focused on one thing for more than a few seconds. Maybe it will get better over time because I just started but it's really disheartening. I'd also like to know what other people do to battle or overcome their ADHD because right now I only know of medication and meditation. \n\nBut maybe the most important thing to me is that I don't want people to know I have ADHD. It seems contrary to what other people say here but to me I'd rather be seen as lazy, uncaring, dumb and unmotivated than seen as someone with a disability. Even me saying that I have a disability to myself makes me cringe, it make me feel like I'm not normal. It probably has a lot to do with my mom and how I grew up but acknowledging I have a disability to me makes me feel like I'm below other people and that I'm stupid. This is the reason why I have repressed this and is one the reasons I'm so insecure and have low self esteem. The only people that know about this are my family and a few close friends, and I'd like to keep it that way.\n\nMy therapist said that how I may choose to go about working of my ADHD is up to me and me alone, and that they will do there best to support me no matter my choice, but that accepting that I need to work of it may be for the best and may be key part to improving my life and fixing my self esteem issues. I know now if I don't start trying to take these steps to fix myself it will never get any better. And after finding this subreddit where people seem to be open talking about this it makes me feel not alone and like I can talk about this. So I'd thought I'd share what I had to say and maybe see if anyone had any advice for me. But don't worry I'm going to do my own research as well so I can be well informed.\n\nThanks if you read this to the end, sorry I'm not the best writer. If I didn't make something clear or messed up something let me know."""

I started to take 20mg thrice a week and then working myself up to 20mg a week. Then I started to increase the coming month to 30, then  40 and now 50mg. I have been taking 50mg for approx 14 days.\n\nThis is where the scary stuff begin to happened. After last year when I stopped isotretinoin I commenced three weeks after stopping, lymecycline as per my derm. I developed such a migraine from it I instantly thought of Intercranial hypertension. Stopped and it subsequently went away. However now, my head is acting up again. I know isotretinoin can cause increase CP around the brain, but many studies show that people whom developed ICP when on the tetracycline class don't develop ICP on accutane. I have this painful back pain in my head for two days. Will it not give away tomorrow, will I call my derm first thing in the morning. Also to note that I stopped isotret as soon I got the headache. No other vision problems or vomiting or nausea. \n\nAlso another side effect I have gotten is that it itches the fuck on my body. Small, itchy bumps where you can see the hair follicule inflamed and often filled with some clear liquid. I have had it since 2 weeks approx since upping the dosage. It iches to the point that i scrath them and they start to bleed. BUT they are veryyyyy tiny. I will try to put out a photo.\n\nIt's just so tiresome to atleast see light in the tunnel and then get smacked all the way to the beginning. I am tired, I am sad, I am crushed. F\\*cking hell."""

The worst effect is itchy eyes that I usually end up scratching and then getting some terrible conjunctivitis.\n\nI have been taking antihistamines since the first time, but I swear they never really worked. I usually notice a slight improvement in my symptoms but short after taking them I go back to nightmare mode. I have tried multiple brands and components (from different generations) and none of them worked.\n\nI have also tried nasal sprays and some antihistaminic drops for the eyes... again nothing really solves the problem. Slight improvement and then back to ""normal"".\n\nThe only thing that works for me is taking Urbason 4mg (Methylprednisolone) which was prescribed as a last-resort solution by a private doctor. I know corticosteroids are a big deal so I tend to use it only for a short period of time and as a last resort. (Dosage is quite low but basically fixes all the symptoms for me).\n\nI got prick-tested (the thing that they do in your arms) a couple of times and couldn\'t identify the source of my allergy but I know it gets worse during summer and in places close to the beach.\n\nAnother thing that happens to me is that I never get any reaction to mosquitoes  not sure it means anything but I always wondered if my sking is basically ""immune"" to everything so that\'s why I get no results from the prick test.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, why am I telling you all of this?\n\n* Is there anyone else with a similar story? I guess I would feel ""better"" and maybe someone has some tips?\n* Should I continue trying more antihistaminics? I think I have tested all the ones I found in my local pharmacy.\n* Any idea/suggestion on what could be causing my allergy and if there is any other test I could do?

Still sort of tired I got my baggage and grabbed a taxi to the hotel/casino. It\'s name was plastered in the sky with giant neon red letters but they were too bright to read on my way in.\n\nOnce I reached my room I splashed water on my face to wake up and changed clothes.  The casino was dark, darker than any I had ever seen.  The games rolled on, people won and lost and yet the silence was deafening all around.  I sat down and had a few goes at two different roulette tables but every slot was a 00.  Snake eyes followed me in and out of every dice roll and the dealer\'s decks were far to rigged to spare me a coin.\n\nI jumped out of the casino and into my room for sleep.  Dreams of old memories and bad choices circled in my head for hours.  I woke with the awful sense that I needed to run.\n\nWithout checking out of the hotel I walked to the nearest car rental.  I figured if I could get to my family in LA they could get me home.  After driving three hours into the desert I stopped at a small bar on the side of the road.  The sign read ""Bar"" as I entered the establishment and the barkeep already had a shot of whisky lined up for me.\n\nI took the shot and slammed the glass back on the bar.  I woke up when my hand slapped my thigh in bed.\n\nThat was my night last night, a dream inside of a dream that was intensely lucid and seemingly much longer than a normal dream.  It did however have the dream trademark of having no ""transitions"" between areas, just being in one place and then being in the next.  \n\nThis is common for me, easily every 2-4 nights.

I was jaundice, couldn\'t produce saliva, and my kidneys were failing. A few years later my father unexpectedly passed away. I\'ve gone through some shit, as I\'m sure a lot of you have as well.

I had most of a Mechanical Engineering degree done, but it seemed hopeless and I tried taking the easier route of changing my major to Secondary Education Math, where I found good hearted people that supported me through my father\'s death.I\'m happy to say that I\'m on my last semester of college and I\'ll be graduating with my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering soon. I disappeared before my finals and began a new job as an Energy Auditor that I did full time. I worked that job from the summer of 2017 to December 2018. In that time, I discovered the Joe Rogan Podcast and at the time I was in need of a male role model to help me rediscover what it meant to be a man. Rogan has guests all the time from scientists to comedians. I learned to laugh again through his podcast. I idolized Joe Rogan as a man that I truly respect and one day I said to myself ""Be the man you want to be"" as in ""When you look in the mirror, I want to look at a man that I can respect for everything that he is.""\n\nWhat did that mean to me? I realized that the things I respect most in a man are fitness, mental stability, emotional health, and intelligence. So I got started. I began working out. I mainly lift weights about 3 times a week. Sometimes less sometimes more, but every time I go, even if it\'s a shitty workout and I have no energy or motivation, I leave that place in a better mood because I know I\'ve done something to better myself. After getting diagnosed, I got on Lamotragine and gradually went from 50 to 200 mg daily. I try not to miss a day, but I\'m not perfect. I definitely notice the days where I miss my meds, because my mood is so uncontrollable that I snap at my closest friends and I get overwhelming urges to kick people in the mouth. I know a lot of people hate Jordan Peterson, and hell I do too the pompous bastard, but his first ""rule for life"" is ""clean your room"". He means this in that you have to take care of your own space before you try and go out and change the world. A clean room helps me so much, guys. Being able to have everything neat and tidy, my bed made, my clothes hung and folded, my desk free of cups and plates, and my bathroom counter hair free and tidy. Seriously if you do ONE thing a day to help your mental state, make your bed. I promise it will motivate you to keep everything else tidy. One thing I did was I got a cool comforter with a big ol\' squid on it. This way I would want to look at my bed and see the squid. If I can\'t see the squid, my room isn\'t clean enough and I get sad. I love squids.\n\nI began to meditate, but unfortunately I dropped the habit months ago. However, to get started I went to audible and got a membership. Audiobooks were a saving grace when working the job I was working and I discovered that there was a free 20 day guided meditation thing. I started with 5 min and eventually got to 20 min of laying in bed, closing my eyes, and breathing slow, controlled breaths. 5 counts in, 10 counts out. Let the mind wander to wherever it may go. Feel whatever it is your mind may bring up, because if it dwells on something YOU NEED TO PROCESS IT! DON\'T SHUT IT AWAY DON\'T SUPPRESS IT! Feel it, then bring your attention back to your breath. You\'ll notice that suddenly the thought is gone and you\'ve moved on. Realize that your thoughts are temporary, even if they swing back in 20 times a day as mine do/did about my ex girlfriend and every woman I\'ve ever hurt.\n\nI began to really let myself feel my emotions. I suppressed them for a long time because as I framed it as ""every time I show my emotions I just end up hurting either myself or someone else"". Recently I have found a woman who really gets me. She shares my interest, and the other night SHE kissed ME. I don\'t know about you guys, but as a man I\'m expected to make every first move. I don\'t remember the last time, even with my ex, where I was kissed first. She looked at me and wanted to kiss ME. I cried. I cried about 3 inches away from her face because I was so happy and relieved that I could be on the receiving end of love. Being able to accept that love takes a lot of work, because I don\'t feel like I deserve it after all the pain I\'ve caused but she doesn\'t care. She likes me, and damn it I like her back. After using Tinder like a drug for about a year, I finally found some emotional connection and not just some chick looking for a guy to call ""Daddy"". I\'m into BDSM, I\'ve been used for that before. A lot. People only accept the love they think they deserve. You all deserve the love that you want to give to yourself. Find the ways you can make yourself happy, without relying on others, and you can find a way to love yourself. Let yourself enjoy things, no matter who may judge you or may criticize you. Try to keep it legal though.\n\nAnyway, this is getting really long and my apologies but I\'ll try to summarize. I go to therapy once a month, down from once every two weeks. I don\'t recommend going every day or every week, because that isn\'t enough time for anything to happen. I have to give it time for events to happen, emotions to arise, and then have something to talk about in therapy. I try to eat ok, though I love taco bell, and I work out 3 times a week. This way I have a body goal, so that when I look in the mirror I can see a body I like to call my own. Flaws and all. I try to meditate. I keep my room tidy. I go to class and enjoy the lecture if I can. I take a moment to look at my surroundings, admire the height of a tree, or the sound of the birds around me. This gets me out of my head and out of those dark thoughts. Find a way to respect yourself and then take action. That\'s the best advice I can offer.\n\nI love you, r/bipolar. Here\'s my monthly Daylio Chart. All twelve months minus the current one lol. Feel free to PM me if you wanna be friends or just need someone to talk to. You\'ve been there for me, let me be there for you.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Rl9n5IG](https://imgur.com/a/Rl9n5IG)'"

antimicrobial problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/5imtcx/hello_fellow_adhders_dental_student_here_just/,"b""Hello fellow ADHD'ers. Dental student here, just wanting to share a friendly PSA about your meds and oral health!""",,"b""The problem: Pretty much all of the meds prescribed for ADHD cause xerostomia (dry mouth). This includes all stimulants, and intuniv. Dry mouth is a huge factor in getting tooth decay and gum disease. You saliva naturally has antimicrobial components (like dozens of types) which reduce the bad bacteria. In someone with chronic dry mouth, bacteria accumulates on the gumline, not on the occlusal/top of the tooth like you normally think of. Even with regular brushing twice a day, you can still get cavities. \n\nYour options:\n\n1. Get a professional cleaning and evaluation every 4-6 months (more frequent than people who aren't as high risk. These are official guidelines for anyone taking these meds). It's expensive now, but when you're risking paying for $2000-3000 to replace a single tooth, it's a really good investment. \n2. Dry mouth options: Biotene mouthwash is fantastic. Use that several times a day. Also Xylimelts by OroCoat is a tablet that goes on your cheek and helps day and night. I personally love these, especially at night. Gum with xylitol is also good. \n3. Make sure you're brushing properly, especially for you guys. Your brush should be at a 45 degree angle and using a soft brush, make sure you get the gum line. The idea is to clean in the little pocket between your gum and your teeth. This is where the bacteria proliferates in dry mouth\n4. Use toothpaste with lots of fluoride. Sensodyne is my recommended brand. You can also get prescription toothpaste with even more fluoride. You can also get prescription fluoride rinses. Additionally, your dentist can give you MI Paste/recaldent which you just brush on at night and don't spit out. It reverses small lesions on your tooth that haven't had enamel break off. \n\nIt sucks that we have this challenge, but this is really important to save you money down the road. Dentistry is insanely expensive if you have wide-spread cavities. The office should send out reminder cards to make appoints, so that's some pressure off of you! \n\nIf you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them!\n\nTL;DR: If you're taking ADHD meds, you need to take extra steps (above) to prevent you from paying tons of money in dental work later because you're at a high risk for cavities."""

The physician assistant on duty said it was dyshidrotic eczema and I was prescribed a topical steroid ointment (triamcinolone acetonide ointment USP, 0.5%) - apply a thin layer twice a day for 10 days. I finished the regimen and while there was some slight discoloration, the skin texture was normal and no itching. \n\nA few days after completing the regimen, the back of my right hand has small bumps on it, redness, a little puffy, and it itches like crazy. It's starting to feel like the beginning stages of whatever I had last time. I'm doing my best to not scratch it. Can I reapply the steroid ~~cream~~ ointment I have leftover, with the same frequency/duration? \n\nThe first time this appeared, I tried Benadryl gel, Calamine lotion, Oatmeal lotion, and Acetaminophen which didn't work. The lotions made it worse to the point of cracking and bleeding. The only relief I found was with the prescribed ointment."""

Advil eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/headaches/comments/c3otcq/daily_tension_headaches_for_over_four_months_now/,b'Daily Tension Headaches for over Four Months - Now They Are Gone Thanks to Neck Stretches',,"b""I've been suffering with daily headaches since February and they'd always come on around mid to late afternoon and last til I went to bed. I'd never wake up with them. Most of the time I just felt crappy but some were bad enough to need advil.\n\nAt first I thought it was because of eye strain, so I went to the optometrist, got a new prescription (slightly progressives) plus blue light filtering lenses. Headaches didn't go away. \n\nI then realized my jaw (TMJ) has been clicking and sore since I got fillings at the dentist at the end of January and so I went back to the dentist, they filed down my fillings to correct my bite, but the dentist said if I was clenching/grinding because of my bite and that was causing the headaches it would be in my sleep and I'd wake up with them, not during the day. So, he suggested it was stress related. \n\nI then did some prodding around to figure out the pressure points that were the cause of my headache and again it was my jaw (TMJ). So, I was trying to do exercises for my jaw to fix the clicking. This didn't help the headaches. \n\nI went to my family doctor, she said based on ruling these other things out (I also new they weren't caffeine withdrawal or dehydration headaches) she said they must be tension headaches caused from bad posture, sedentary lifestyle, all day looking at my phone/computer and perhaps also not eating or drinking water til noon most days. A combination of things. She prescribed massage and chiropractics (which I have not done yet but I'm planning on doing both massage and physio therapy).\n\nI then got thinking that maybe my tension isn't coming just from my jaw alone and perhaps from my neck. I deduced that my always slouched/hunched, looking down at my phone, looking down at my laptop positions were shortening/tightening my front neck muscles which was pulling my jaw. At the time of figuring this out I was starting to wake up with jaw pain. \n\nI started doing simple neck stretches (set an alarm and tried to remember to do them every two hours) and the headaches are gone. \n\nTLDR: Was getting tension headaches everyday, took a while to figure out that it was tightened neck muscles causing jaw pain and tension headaches. Simple neck stretches done 4 or 5 times a day or every two hours eliminated the headaches immediately.   \nHope this helps anyone who is also suffering from daily unexplained headaches."""
corticosteroid rash,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/9e72eg/my_unofficial_guide_to_surviving_accutane_holy/,b'My unofficial guide to surviving Accutane: holy grail products and routine',,"b""This is a compilation of the most useful tips and products for me on Accutane. This subreddit has been extremely helpful for me and I wanted to share what I have found helpful in hopes that others will do the same. This is thorough and might be a bit much for people who aren't super into skincare, but hopefully it will be useful for some.\n\n**General comments about finding products:** First off, talk to your dermatologist. They will give recommendations (often CeraVe or other gentle, fragrance-free formulations for sensitive skin), and they can usually provide samples! When that is not enough, peruse the pharmacy for soothing products that are marketed towards people with eczema or psoriasis, or towards actual babies. Products for these groups are designed for your sensitive skin - use them! I frequent the baby aisle and have found great body washes and creams there. If you, like me, enjoy skincare, do look into French, Japanese, and especially Korean skincare. I find these to be really great for sensitive skin in need of moisture. If you are interested in this, check out /r/AsianBeauty and /r/SkincareAddiction. Becoming familiar with good ingredients and common irritants is helpful in order to buy products that work. For me, accutane has been a lot of trial and error, which means I've bought products that did not work for me and I only used a few times. This is bad for your skin and wallet!\n\nSome resources for this:\n\n[COSDNA:](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/) view a product's ingredients, their purpose, and the safety of the ingredient. The database might not have every product you are interested in, but it can give you some familiarity with skincare ingredients.\n\n[Paula's Choice Ingredient Dictionary:](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary) look up specific ingredients you are curious about.\n\n**A note about my skin:** I had mild but persistent acne and very sensitive, extremely combination skin (very oily sometimes and very dry at others, or even all at once - ugh)I am on my fifth month of Accutane at my peak dose of 80mg. I started with 20mg and went up every month. My worst side effects (primarily just dryness) were always when my dose was upped. I had a breakout every month when my dose went up as well.\n\n**My most useful products:**\n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask:** hands down the best lip treatment I have tried. I use it day and night. Nothing can compare! I love that it moisturizes and provides an occlusive barrier. The problem for me with Aquaphor is that it provides an occlusive barrier, but when I apply it on extremely dry lips, it doesn't have much effect and I have to reapply within a few minutes. I attribute this to the fact that the lips are too dry for it to actually do anything unless there is already some moisture underneath. That's why Laneige is great. Sometimes I apply it and then apply Aquaphor, which is THE BEST. Unfortunately, Laneige is not great for bringing on the go. I usually make do with the mini tubes of Aquaphor when Im out of the house.\n\n**Hada Lobo Hyaluronic Acid Lotion:** very much a game changer for me. A liquid step before moisturizer has been essential to maintaining semi-normal skin during my course, and hyaulronic acid is one of the best skincare ingredients you can find for dry skin. I use this as soon as I finish washing my face or get out of the shower, and follow up a minute or so after with moisturizer. Can't emphasize enough how useful this has been.\n\n**HPR Plus emollient foam:** this is a prescription moisturizer and it has been one of the best things that I have used for body dryness - I haven't really used it on my face but you can do that as well. Much of my course has been during the summer, which has been a particularly hot, humid, and sticky one, making moisturizing my body problematic. In order to get the moisture I need, I was using thick creams, which combined with humidity, were making me sticky to the touch. It was extremely unpleasant for me on 95 degree days with high humidity levels. My dermatologist recommended this and it is excellent. I use it as soon as I get out of the shower. It has completely fixed my body's dry skin and it does not make me sticky at all. If you dont want to go prescription with this, look for a foam moisturizer. I dont know of any good ones but Im sure they are out there!\n\n**Cloderm:** another prescription, this one a corticosteroid. This is great for dry areas of skin that simply do not respond to anything else. In my third month, I developed red, itchy, and flaky patches of skin on my legs that were inflamed constantly. Essentially, they were patches of eczema. My doctor gave me samples of this to use and it cleared these up. The only thing is that you should not use this regularly. My derm said no more than 2 weeks of use at a time. If you dont want to get a prescription, you could try an OTC hydrocortisone cream. Just dont overdo it!\n\n**Supplements:** I regularly take **Fish oil, vitamin E, and fiber supplements**. For fish oil and vitamin E - both of these supplements will help with dryness and with the absorption of the medicine. I take them at the same time as I take my pill. Fiber - A weirder and especially unpleasant symptom for me was regular upset stomach. It is not really painful upset stomach but it caused constipation (something Id never had an issue with) and essentially made my stool, well, messiersorry, I know, grossbut yeahit happens! This is THE WORST on accutane, because if you have to wipe a lot, then the skin down there gets dry and irritated and it is truly awful. Fiber supplements helped fix this for me almost completely. Prior to it being fixed, I found using wipes and diaper rash cream helpful. Diaper rash cream is definitely the strangest product I have had to buy because of accutane but it really helped with the dry and irritated skin down there when it was really bad. I only had to use it a few times but it helped!\n\n**Konjac sponges:** Sometimes you just really have to get rid of the flaky skin on your face and body. Konjac sponges are a very gentle way to do so. I recommend using them sparingly...twice a week AT MOST and only if your skin is super flaky/dry/rough. I generally use them in the shower and immediately follow with moisturizer.\n\n**My current routine:**\n\nAM: wash face with **La Roche Posay Toleraine Hydrating Gentle Cleanser.** PM: if wearing makeup, use **cleansing oil** (Kose Softymo or Banila), followed by same cleanser used in AM.AM: Apply **Hada Lobo Hyaulronic Lotion.** PM: apply **COSRX Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence** after Hada Lobo.\n\nPM: If I have whiteheads I will apply **hydrocolloid acne patches** to them.\n\nAM: Apply **COSRX Hyaulronic Acid Intensive Cream**, followed by **Avene Clean-Ac cream**. PM: apply **COSRX Hyaulronic Acid Intensive Cream**, followed by **Avene Cicalfate cream**. (Note about this: the 2 moisturizer method is the only thing that will keep my skin moisturized all day. The COSRX cream is really great but doesnt do the job alone. I use a small amount of the Avene Clean-AC a few seconds after to seal my moisturizer. If my undereyes are particularly dry I will use an eye cream in addition to the COSRX which I put under my eyes. Right now I am using a sample of Caudalies Premier Cru).\n\nPM: Apply **Aquaphor** to super dry spots. This was unfathomable to me pre-accutane but is very helpful! Sometimes I use **The Ordinary Rosehip Oil**. I used it more during the super-dry periods when my dose had gone up by mixing it into my PM moisturizer. Now, I only dab it on healing spots that are dry and flaky. It seems to help heal them and reduce the length of lingering redness.\n\nBoth AM and PM I use **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** on my lips, and dab **Aquaphor** in the corners of my mouth to make sure they dont crack. If they are very cracked, I apply a tiny bit of **Cloderm** and follow it with **Aquaphor**. If my lips are even drier than usual, I  combine **Laneige** and **Aquaphor**.\n\nMakeup I try to keep minimal but I find it necessary for work. I use **Dr. Jart+ Cicapair Derma Green-Cure Solution Recover Cream**. This is similar to a BB/CC cream and is excellent for redness, especially for someone super pale like me. It has enough SPF for my limited time in direct sunlight on a work day (if I know Im going to be outside in the sun I wear a hat). I use **NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer** for spots. I try not to use powder and instead use an **Urban Decay setting spray**.\n\n***Please share thoughts, feedback, and recommendations!***"""

I thought it'd be okay since I had been on ~600mg/day and had weaned down to a max of 200mg/day prior to starting this (self-medication, I guess?). I was wrong. I have in today and took 1g of Acetaminophen, 325mg Aspirin and 100mg of caffeine, a well-known migraine-defeating cocktail...and it worked. I think now perhaps it was more caffeine withdrawal than the Concerta itself. Unsure about the hunger issue yet, as it's still morning.*\n\n\n**TLDR Edit: Caffeine withdrawals = migraines.**\n\n**EDIT: Should anyone come across this in the future using the search - now on 54mg in the morning (Concerta still) and no longer hungry. Like...ever. Perhaps it was dose-related. Felt as though it wore off ~6 hrs after taking. 54mg works much, much longer for me.**"""

NSAID rash,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/12j2gu1/need_help_navigating_rheumatologist_appt_tldr_at/,b'Need help navigating Rheumatologist appt (TL;DR at the bottom!)',,"b""***This is a very long read, TL;DR included at the bottom.*** \n\n I (31,F) have been having a number of medical issues that have gone mostly undiagnosed since 2018. My PCP is an Internist and I am on my 6th specialty type since 2021 (OBGYN x2, Urology, Gyn Oncology, Interventional Radiology, Gastro, and now Rheum). At this time, my PCP suspects some type of autoimmune/rheumatic process and has referred me to Rheumatology - she heavily suspected Lupus but my ANA was Neg so she wasn't sure how to proceed. The rheumatologist did several additional labs some of which were abnormal but they slapped me with a fibromyalgia diagnosis and claimed that this is what is going on even though a lot of symptoms / issues aren't explained by this diagnosis. I have a lot of information available  including labs and imaging if someone would be able to discuss more in detail. I have a second opinion with a new rheumatologist next week but at this point I'm running out of ways to advocate for myself. Autoimmune is a bit out of my scope. Not necessarily looking for a diagnosis here more so just guidance/advice as to what questions I should be asking or any other diagnostics that I should be advocating for? \n\n**Relevant Medical History:**\n\n First period started at 12yr; very heavy and painful but very regular  small clots only. \n\n Chronic Migraines since period started  treated PRN with Imitrex until 2020.\n\n Four pregnancies - 2 miscarriages, 2 healthy vaginal deliveries.\n\n Period became more significant after children; heavy/painful with large clots and longer (8-10d \n\nvs previous 5-7)\n\n Diagnosed with Asthma as a toddler but never had typical issues and it did not impact my QOL; \n\nalbuterol inhaler used only when sick / congested. \n\n Seasonal Allergies except they happen all year long and do not respond to antihistamines \n\nlots of sinus pain/pressure. \n\n History of frequent URIs and complications from illness. Approx 2-3 times per year I get a cold \n\nof some kind and require use of the albuterol inhaler. Almost every time, the illness will become \n\nbronchitis and/or pneumonia and require additional abx/steroids etc. to manage. Twice I have \n\nbeen to the ER for low SPO2. \n\n Sick or not, I crackle/wheeze when laying down and can usually cough and move or produce \n\nmucus. \n\n ALLERGIC TO BACTRIM  severe vaginal swelling, bleeding, and peeling. Also, severe oral thrush. \n\n(this is a relatively new reaction I have used Bactrim approx. 10 years ago with no reactions. \n\nPrescribed Bactrim in 2022 and had a very severe reaction with vaginal and oral swelling, \n\nbleeding, blistering and peeling.)\n\n Sept 2020  discontinued Imitrex for migraine as it was no longer effective, started Topamax \n\nand amitriptyline.\n\n November 2022  Discontinued use of Topiramate 100mg SID PM and Amitriptyline 30mg SID \n\nPM for migraines. At this time, the only medication used is Naratriptan PRN for migraines. \n\n Previously used Metformin for weight loss for 2 months  discontinued due to continuous GI \n\nupset.\n\n Adopted so family history is limited: biological mother and sister both have hx of uterine cancer \n\nand had hysterectomy prior to age 35. Biological mother has hx of colorectal cancer. Biological \n\naunt and maternal grandmother have hx of breast cancer. \n\n MyRisk BRCA genetic testing performed and NEGATIVE. Only increased risk is slightly elevated \n\nfor colorectal cancer due to family history.\n\n**Recent Treatments/Diagnostics:**\n\n 2018 -irregular periods with severe pain and heavy bleeding with very large clots. Very irregular \n\nand inconsistent. Bleeding would last anywhere from one day to three weeks and would happen \n\nat unknown intervals  sometimes multiple times a month.\n\n 2019  Enlarged uterus on US; PROCEDURE: endometrial ablation. Good results with no pain or \n\nbleeding for approx. 2 years after procedure. \n\n 2022  Irregular bleeding/cramping returns with abdominal bloating/swelling. PROCEDURE: \n\ntotal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy.\n\no Dr. stated suspected endometriosis and adenomyosis, but this is not notated on any \n\nmedical records surgery notes indicate that reason for hysterectomy was heavy \n\nbleeding and enlarged uterus. \n\n History of ovarian cysts that rupture (sometimes very painful). The same Dr that performed the \n\nhysterectomy stated this was PCOS and is common. No treatments or therapies were performed \n\nfor PCOS and this diagnosis is not formally noted in any of his medical records. \n\n Approx. 3 months after hysterectomy, symptoms return. \n\no Pelvic and abdominal pain, nausea with vomiting, acid reflux/heartburn, inappetence, \n\nvaginal bleeding, abdominal swelling, constipation and then diarrhea. \n\n US shows 10+cm peritoneal inclusion cyst on the left adnexa and intertwined with colon and \n\nrectum. Referred to gyn oncology. PROCEDURE: Robotic cystectomy and drain PIC fluid, heavy \n\nadhesion clean up. \n\n Approx. 1 week later, fluid and all symptoms return.\n\no Pelvic/abdominal pain, abdominal swelling, nausea with vomiting, acid reflux/heartburn, \n\ninappetence, constipation then diarrhea.\n\no PROCEDURE: Referred to an interventional radiologist to drain fluid via ultrasound \n\nguidance. Removed 750mls from left side PIC. \n\n Approx. 1 month after draining, symptoms return with slight variance. \n\no Pelvic pain across the entire lower pelvic region, abdominal pain at the top of the \n\nabdomen, flank pain on both sides, lower back pain. Left foot and ankle joint pain.\n\no Other symptoms include nausea with vomiting, constipation then diarrhea, \n\ninappetence, heartburn/reflux, abdominal swelling. \n\n CT performed 12/1  the PIC fluid has NOT returned. Results indicate mild sigmoid diverticulosis, \n\nsm volume free fluid noted within the posterior cul de sac, Resolution of the left pelvic large \n\ncystic lesion with only a small amount of local free fluid and fibrosis. 2mm non obstructing left \n\nrenal calculi, Hepatic Steatosis.\n\no Follow up with gyn onc. 12/5  Dr says per CT results no PIC fluid returned, and CT is \n\nrelatively normal. Suspects inflammatory response due to the number of procedures \n\nthis year. Started 5 days of Toradol.\n\n Hepatic Steatosis  previously diagnosed and viewed on imaging prior to 12/1 CT. Since approx. \n\nJune 2022 ALT has remained slightly elevated. Liver US shows no cirrhosis, only hepatic \n\nsteatosis. No treatments or therapies have been discussed or recommended at this time. \n\n At this time, there is no formal diagnosis or explanation for the continued pelvic and abdominal \n\npain and other symptoms. Gyn Onc recommends wait and see and drain PIC fluid as it returns \n\nwith use of pain meds and nsaids to manage discomfort. She does not understand why I am \n\nhaving pain, where it is coming from, or how to address it without fluid buildup.\n\n 10/17/22 labs: \n\no cytomegalovirus antibody (IGG) elevated >10.00\n\no EBV nuclear AG (EBNA) AB (IGG) elevated >600.00\n\no EBV viral capsid AG (VCA) AB (IGG) elevated >750.00\n\n Referred to Gastro. 3/16/2023 PROCEDURE: colonoscopy and EGD. \n\no Colonoscopy results: several polyps removed and sent for biopsy, redundant colon. \n\no EGD results: stomach lining inflammation, sample of stomach lining taken for biopsy. \n\nInlet patch of esophagus. \n\n ER labs: \n\no Albumin elevated 4.9, BUN low 8, calcium elevated 10.6, total protein elevated 8.7, \n\nmean cell HGB elevated 33.2, mean cell volume elevated 97.5\n\n Follow up with PCP due to ER visit for severe abdominal pain and severe nausea. PCP suspects \n\nautoimmune as a possible consideration  primary suspect Lupus due to symptoms and \n\npresentation. PCP unsure how to proceed due to results  neg ANA but very elevated CRP/ESR. \n\nReferral to rheumatology. \n\no ANA negative, rheumatoid factor negative, cyclic citrullinated peptide WNL. \n\no C- Reactive protein elevated val 16.9 mg/L\n\no Sed Rate by Modified Westergren elevated val 56 mm/h\n\no Vitamin D Low val 18ng/ml\n\no HLA B27 result PENDING\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Current symptoms are:**\n\no Pelvic Pain  dull, aching, cramping pain across entire lower pelvic region with increased \n\nsharp/stabbing pain when active.\n\no Abdominal pain in multiple areas. LLQ pain is consistent and aching/cramping and \n\nincreases severity when active or when laying on left side.

NSAID problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/11l7s19/dont_know_when_ill_get_a_good_nights_rest_again/,b'Dont know when Ill get a good nights rest again',,"b'My sciatica has been going on since October 2022, and its been in a state of getting worse, getting better, getting worse. The doctor prescribed me a two week course of prednisone as I only decided to go to the doctor last week, I guess I was just hoping it would go away on its own, no chance. Its helping a bit but Im hoping to see better results as time goes on. \n\nMy sciatica can be fine during the day, then at night is when its holy hell. Ill be so exhausted and all I want is sleep, but the instant I lie down it starts, constantly tossing and turning and grimacing in agony, as nothing is comfortable. Ive tried pillows, tennis balls, nothing really helps. Eventually I will pass out, but not without waking up several times in the night. \n\nThe real kicker is, I was at a point where I was in so much pain at night I was tossing back NSAIDS like ibuprofen and alleve, on an empty stomach, and as a result Ive burned my stomach lining, so now Im in two different kinds of pain. I find in the morning the pain subsides and I can sleep a lot more comfortably, but I cant seem to do the same at night. I dont really get it. All I want is a decent nights sleep but its a vicious cycle, I take sleep medication to try knock myself out, and then I have to load myself up on pepto bismol so that I wont be in agony with my stomach, yet I have to avoid painkillers as it makes my tummy worse, yet then my leg pain is awful without them. I feel like sciatica has just made me addicted to my medication cabinet and led to more problems.'"
acetaminophen problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/8ch0tn/please_share_your_strategies_and_regimens_for/,b'Please share your strategies and regimens for psychotropic med-induced constipation.',,"b'Hi all. Ive been dealing with psychotropic med-induced constipation for a while and it can be very painful and frustrating as some of you can relate. Im writing to see if any of you are willing to share management regimens that work for you, successful treatment experiences that you have had, or any relevant stories youd like to share. \n\n\nCurrently Im taking Senna Plus Tablets (docusate sodium 50 mg & sennosides 8.6 mg) once a day and fiber gummies (2-4 g soluble & dietary fiber daily). I might increase the Senna to twice daily per doctors orders because Im still not having complete bowel movements and only going twice a week. I also have Miralax but dont usually reach for it because have never really found it to make a difference. I have magnesium oxide 500 mg caplets that I used to take that were somewhat helpful that I might add back into my pill organizer. \n\n\nWhen I was on clozapine things were so bad I was going maybe once or twice a week. I happened to be admitted for an episode where I mentioned these issues and they took an abdominal x-ray and were horrified at the state of my colon. They wouldnt admit me to the unit until they could make me have a bowel movement as I was basically on my way to almost being impacted. They gave me magnesium citrate (which might be the most disgusting thing ever), senna, and a suppository and threatened to manually disimpact me if that didnt do the job. Yikes. Thankfully sometimes later some of the worst cramps in my life finally got things moving. After an exhausting hour in the bathroom - they were pleased and admitted me to the floor. \n\n\nThey kept me on twice daily senna and I was able to go normally for close to a month. Then things fell into their old patterns again and Im so frustrated. I did stop taking the senna at some point and dont want to have to rely on it. I know its bad to use a stimulant laxative continuously. Ive reintroduced it again recently because the situation has grown pretty dire again.  Sigh. Im really tired of pooping like a hesitant rabbit. \n\n\nI had a doc give me samples of Linzess at some point but I lost them and never actually got to try it out. Ive always been sort of prone to constipation so Im wondering if it might be worth bringing it up to my pdoc. How I wish I still had those samples!!!\n\n\nI had recently had some lithium added to my cocktail and that always seemed to loosen my bowels which seemed to normalize things for me whereas maybe it would cause diarrhea for someone else. Sadly it hasnt been the case but it may be because we opted for a low dose add-on since my cocktail is so busy. Dunno if it would be worth shifting things around and increasing the lithium to see what happens. Ideas ideas. \n\n\n**TLDR**; Anyways - talk to me about your struggles with psychotropic drug induced constipation and what has worked for you. Nobody likes to talk about pooping (or not pooping) but I know Im not alone in this struggle! \n\n\nPosting my med cocktail below in case anyone has any insight on any offenders to my problem:\n\n* Latuda - 60 mg qPM \n* Lithium ER - 450 qPM \n* Zonegran (zonisamide) - 200 mg BID\n* Zoloft - 50 mg qAM\n* Adderall XR - 30 mg qAM \n* Ativan - 2 mg QHS PRN \n* Ativan - 1 mg PRN\n* Hydroxyzine - 10-20 mg PRN\n* Levothyroxine - 100 mcg qAM \n* Liothyronine - 25 mcg qAM \n* Spironolactone - 100 mg BID\n* Metformin - 500 mg qPM\n* Senna Plus - 50/8.6 mg 1-2 QD\n* Fiber Gummies - 2-4 g sol fiber QD\n* Loratadine - 10 mg PRN\n* Acetaminophen - 500 mg PRN\n* Aspirin/APAP/Caffeine - 250/250/65 mg PRN\n'"
penicillin problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/grvwd7/severe_back_chestarms_and_starting_to_appear_on/,"b'SEVERE back, chest,arms, and starting to appear on butt + thigh acne. Please help I dont know what to do anymore :('",,"b'Im 20f, Im not including a picture because i dont feel comfortable. Im gonna include some backstory and what ive tried already and everything. Sorry for any typos or grammar issues im on my phone but ill try my best.\n\nIve had HORRIBLE acne ever since i was little. Like in elementary school. My facial acne was INSANE. We started by trying topicals, my skin was to sensitive and i couldnt handle the topicals well. Eventually i gave up and just let it be, washed my face but that never helped. My back acne developed in elementary school as well but it wasnt bad at all and it wasnt our orimary focus. In middle school into highschool,i used antibiotics because i refused any type of topical. The first one im forgetting the name but was good it helped my facial acne a lot. I was on it for about a year and then i stopped. so my facial acne by highschool was 1000x better and i didnt mind whatever acne i did have because it was just so much better then it was.\n\n But my back acne was horrible, i have so many scars down my entire back. Sometime during my junior year igot on birthcontrol(the patch) which basically cleared up my facial acne. But not my back acne. I then switched to nexplanon which made no difference in my acne. In the beginning of nexplanon( firdt few months) i got a few cysts but those went away and havent had any since.\n\n\nIm sorry i didnt mention this earlier by back acne i also mean the acne down my arms and on my chest and on my neck. \nIts everywhere.\n\nIve tried everything. So in highschool my senior year i switch to another antibiotic. Im allergic to penicillin and i didnt wanna use the one i used before because im against using antibiotics unless you really need to like for real infections. so i tried this antibiotic and had a horrible allergic reaction to it as well lol so i stopped i never wanna use antibiotics again for acne. \n\nThen i started using this spray, which helped but it was just to expensive and i cant afford buying so much product when im using so much it was a small bottle and it only helped a little like not a lot.\n\nIve tried witch hazel, it doesnt help\n\nI tried nizoral. But i also tried going gluten free at the same time. im also worried about it affecting my birthcontrol so i dont plan to try nizoral again.\nI stopped nizoral but remained gluten free and i was still getting small break outs. But i did notice my skin clearing up tremendously. But i broke my gluten free diet and now im back to square one.\n\nNow why dont you go back to being gluten free? You might ask.\n\nWell i am, i have been for a few weeks now. But my skin is absolutely terrible. but i always noticed my skin gets worse before it gets better so im hoping thats whats happening.\n\nIve tried megadosing on vitamin b5, this actually helped alot but it made my jaw hurt lol so i stopped. \nSo maybe its a vitamin deficiency but ive been taking multivitamins. And i do actually incorporate vitamin b5 more after noticing it making a difference. \n\nWhy not go see a dermatologist?\nI have. I went to one when i was in hs that prescribed me the antibiotics that gave me a terrible allergic reaction. And i just dont wanna go back. Everybody just wants to treat the symptoms not the actual cause and its so frustrating.\n\n\nBasically what ive been doing now. I take a show every other day where i exfoliate( this isnt the reason im breaking out.), and then i will put aloe very all over my body basically because its basically everywhere besides my legs. But it has started appearing on my butt and upper thighs.\n\nI generally dont wear tight clothes. I mostly wear cotton t shirts or hoodies and pj bottoms that arent fitted just loose. i do weae tight jeans though but ive never had an issue with acne on my butt or legs before. \n\nIm really thinking I may have a intolerance to gluten because i feel so much better when i dont eat gluten and my skin clears. I didnt get bad bloating when i went back to eating gluten before but before i tried gluten free i got bloated so easily and so much. But now i dont bloat. Sorry if that was confusing.\n\nSo im just wondering if any of you have any other possible remedies i can try. If being gluten free doesnt work then i probably do plan to go to my doctor to get referred to a dermatologist even though i really just dont trust dermatologists. Also to get tested for a gluten insensitivity.\n\nIm getting really tired of hiding my skin because people always ask whats wrong with my skin lol and its so annoying because like yeah i see it i know its there if i knew what was causing it id fix it asap. Ive never been able to feel comfortable in tank tops or off the shoulder shirts which i love. i actually wanna live lol im so tired of this my brothers dont have acne problems (we are triplets so we are the same age). I dont wanna feel self conscious of my skin anymore. And once the acne is gone i gotta deal with the scars but aloevera realllyyy helps my scarring so im hoping by using it basically every other day its helping.\n\nIf you read this far thank you im so sorry this post is so long. Id really appreciate any suggestions!'"
NSAID itch,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/uozbnd/could_healing_take_more_than_four_months_postroot/,b'Could healing take more than four months post-root canal?',,"b""I had a root canal performed on a molar that didn't require it (the offending temperature-sensitive tooth turned out to be the one behind, for which the cause was never established. However a subsequent RCT fixed it). The first root-treated tooth had no symptoms of its own, as the pain turned out to be referred.\n\nBut since the RCT it has been pressure sensitive and hurts (almost itches) when I wobble it. This began even before the RCT when the dentist first decided to replace the old filling, and never subsided. NSAIDs aren't giving much relief.\n\nOn a recent visit to my dentist to explain the problem, she did a cold test (no sensation, tooth is dead), an x-ray (showed no issues) and confirmed that she did not find any crack when looking for one during the procedures. She suggested the issue could be bruxism and recommended a nightguard. \n\nCould there be any other potential issue to look for? Or can some root treatments cause discomfort that is so long-lasting? I am finding it difficult to accept the bruxism theory, but will invest in a custom night guard anyway. I have been using a boil and bite one for a couple of weeks in the meantime, with no improvement.\n\n(No medical issues, non-smoker, no medications except NSAIDs)."""
