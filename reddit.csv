I am 38 years old, male, non-smoking and 90kg at 1.83m.\n\nI have anxiety for many years and currently on medication with Lexapro(escitalopram) for 5 years.\n\nI also have reflux and a hiatal hernia(seen with X-RAY). I've been having stomach issues for many years, like gas, bloating, random nausea and moderate pain in different places. All this time I've seen a doctor and they blame it on my anxiety, since blood works are ok, ultrasound ok and no warning symptoms.\n\nFor some reason at some point i developed a feer of stomach cancer(due to my anxiety). I've been having this for many years. Have made all possible cancer markers and they all come ok. To put my mind at ease my doc ordered an endoscopy in about 3 weeks. Obviously that spiralled into more anxiety due to the anestheisa part. It will be made with Midazolam, so now I'm wondering if it will interact with my Lexapro? What if i don't wake up? And stuff like that.\n\nSorry for the long post, wanted to give some context.\n\n"""
covid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/fuj9kw/teeth_pain_during_covid19/,b'Teeth pain during COVID-19',,"b""Hello!\n\nI had a filling done on one of my bottom right teeth back in early January. The dentist said it was quite a deep filling, and the weeks afterwards I experienced sensitivity, couldn't chew on hard foods, etc. After telling my dentist about the sensitivity, he took an x-ray and recommended coming in to see him again to get a crown. Initially, he only did the filling because he wanted to try save the teeth.\n\nThe sensitivity disappeared in late Feb/March and everything felt normal, so I ended up cancelling my follow-up appointment (which I now regret). A few days ago I started experiencing severe pain on that same teeth. A pulsing kind of pain and hurts when I bite down. Starting today, I started feeling pain during the daytime as well and couldn't eat properly. Before today, most of the pain occurred at night and I was able to eat, brush teeth, etc. with no issues.\n\nSince I'm in Chicago with 'shelter in place' issued, definitely not trying to expose myself/others but also feel like this may get worse. I contacted my dentist (office closed) and am waiting to hear back from them, but in the meantime...any advice/recommendations? I'm not sure why I'm feeling such pain all of a sudden, 3 months after the filling. I've tried gurgling warm salt water and it increased the pain:/ Ibuprofen helps, but the pain doesn't go away completely.\n\nThank you!"""

Thank you in advance for any insight. \nIve had a sore throat for over 2 months. I was on prednisone and keflex (antibiotic) and while it might have helped slightly, the sore throat went away on one side, but persisted on the other. Ive seen my primary doctor twice and he isnt concerned, but referred me to an ENT. Unfortunately the soonest available appt is still over 3 weeks away. \nThe sore throat is in one specific area on one side of my throat, and is most noticeable/painful when I swallow saliva. The only other thing worth noting is that I have a submandibular gland/node that can be felt under that side jaw, and it is sometimes tender or achey. I had an ultrasound on it early February and everything came back normal, but I do tend to wonder if its related. \nIve attached three pictures. The first is just saying ahh, but the second is while Im gagging. That lower mass on the right side seems to be exactly what is hurting and Im very concerned. Is that a normal part of the throat?

I sometimes go months without periods and when I do get them they usually only last for about 4-6 days and are very heavy. Before I was on birth control I had ~10 day long periods, also heavy. Never once before or after a period (for 11 years) have I experienced sore/swollen breasts. But about two and a half weeks ago my boobs were sore as hell and barely fit into my biggest bra! I'm a 38F cup and the bra was 40G. Any time my nipple rubbed against something it hurt really bad and occasionally my breasts would get sharp pain attacks that lasted around 2 minutes each time. I wasn't on my period at the time. I went to my doctor and took a urine test and came out negative for pregnancy, two days later I got an ultrasound on my breasts and came out negative for anything strange inside. Immediately after the ultrasound (like almost just after I got home) I started my period which lasted about 5 days, same length same flow. Just about 6 days ago I began spotting (light amounts of blood in underwear) and I thought it was nothing strange, it happens sometimes. But it's been 6 days and it hasn't stopped, almost like a second period? And recently (the last 3 days) it's been heavier. I've started wearing pads again because it hasn't stopped. I really don't know what to make of this. I've never had problems with my cycle like this and the breast pain makes me feel paranoid about something but I don't know what.\nUpdate: I would like to update that I'm having really, really bad cramps unlike my normal ones. I've had bad cramps before but this just feels different in a way I don't know how to explain."""

Anxiety gone, can say anything, but might still say the wrong things. \n\nNicotine: (ecig) Improves focus and anxiety. Reduces racing thoughts. I\'ve taken up vaping throughout the day a few days ago and it helps me cope with the stress and pressure of going to a school where I\'m ignored or harassed. \n\nCannabis: In *very* low doses can loosen me up, but anything more makes me more withdrawn and introspective. Usually better alone. Can lead to a very objective mindset and seeing things from other people\'s point of view. Very susceptible to increased anxiety and racing heart if overdone though, for me. Becomes habitual if used too often, quitting is relatively easy but quitting after heavy everyday use can leave me cloudy and off-point for about a day or two. \n\nDextromethorphan: Thought patterns may deviate to childlike fantasies I.E. listening to Pink Floyd made me convinced I should immediately take up guitar although I didn\'t end up doing so. Melting/flowing/feeling music through the whole body. Deep introspection. Body sensitivity and disassociation probably more prominent than in an average neurotypical individual. In the next-day afterglow, I felt ""less autistic"" and my anxiety/depression totally melted away for a couple of days.

He just gave me 50mg of phenargen and I was later discharged after the swelling calmed down.  I think my reaction was from the air filtering of the mask causing me to breath clean air all day and once I took it off the sudden amount of dust caused this huge reaction. Is that possible? If its not my mild allergy to dust, the only things I had that day were seafood and rice, which I had the night before and Im not allergic to. And the same morning tea I eat each day.

The soonest appointment they had was Friday the next week (17th.)\n\nI was managing pain with ibuprofen and Tylenol together until that stopped working. Missed 2 days of work due to intense pain at night and not being able to sleep. Called my dentist and asked for something for the pain, he gave me 8 hydrocodone to tide me over.\n\nFriday morning I started to see some swelling on my neck that was noticable to other people. By Saturday morning the swelling had grown a lot. I had been on the penicillin four days and it seemed to obviously not be working. Went into an emergency dentist, he prescribed Z-Pak and 800mg Ibuprofen. Gave me a referral to a different endodontist to see if I can get in sooner. Said to go to the ER if the swelling started to affect my breathing, but they seemed to think the swelling was pretty normal, which relieved me a bit. \n\nHowever, my swelling is continuing to increase, and now the left side of the bottom of my mouth is starting to swell up, swallowing is becoming more difficult, and I've been drooling the last time I slept. Pain is intolerable until I take a hydrocodone with the ibuprofen. I only have one left because most providers don't like to prescribe that stuff now. I was trying to ration it as much as possible for night only but the pain is very intense.\n\nI only took the first dose of 2 Z-Pak a little over 12 hours ago.

I don't want to be that guy that googles stuff and self diagnoses, but I am worried about Ludwigs Angina due to all of the swelling being the underside of my neck and now the fact that underneath my tongue is starting to swell. I know it is rare, but I am pretty freaked out due to how bad the swelling is (never had anything like this happen before, and this is far from my first tooth infection.)\n\nMy wife is a nurse and wants to take me to the ER today, but the emergency dentist said not to do that until swelling makes breathing harder.

I hate having to cry before I go into work and then walking in like nothing happened.  \nIm losing all of my motivation and sometimes I feel so disconnected from everything that I CANT cry, no matter how much I feel that swelling feeling in my chest/throat.  \nand Ive come close to ending my life before. It wouldve actually happened once if there werent police at the bridge I drove to that night. I dream and fantasize and plan it very often, but thats the only time Ive ever truly nearly done it. I used to take acetaminophen, but BARELY enough over the allowed dosages just to see if anything would happen. It was stupid, I know, couldve fucked up my organs. All I ever got was mild pain. I was hoping it would be enough for something to happen without committing to ending it completely so somebody would get the hint that I need help. \n\nOther than that one isolated incident though, I dont know if I actually would ever be able to go through with killing myself, I feel too cowardly. Although sometimes I really do scare myself.  \nChecking myself into a mental hospital does seem dramatic but I feel as if I WANT to do something dramatic because Ive been crying out to my parents for help since I was a teen and nobody will listen. The one time I asked for help because I had relapsed (cutting), my dad straight up told me that therapy is a waste of time and money and that Im just looking for attention. I feel like nobody cares and I feel so awful only being able to Vent to my friends because none of them feel bad to the extent that I do; and I feel like telling them my problems is selfish and puts a lot of stress on their backs. \n\nBut I dont know if the way I feel is serious enough for a solution like checking myself into a hospital. Plus there would be embarrassing consequences - having to call out of work and tell them where I went. My coworkers would find out, I like them a lot and dont want them to think any less of me. My friends might judge me too. My family would make fun of me and walk on eggshells around me. The people I know who have been checked in told me it was a miserable experience. \n\nI dont know how to start therapy on my own though; Im under my parents health insurance so I would have to go to my familys primary doctor to start and my dad would find out and be disappointed in me. If I was prescribed medication or if I was referred to therapy we probably wouldnt be able to afford it.\n\nI dont know how much longer I can do this'"

ibuprofen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/jkmigf/ibuprofen_cured_longterm_pain_in_3_days/,b'Ibuprofen Cured Long-term Pain in 3 Days?',,"b""For a couple of years I've had sensitivity around an upper back tooth filling such that I would only drink room temperature drinks. The filling is about 20 years old and considered a large one. A few months ago I started getting pain when chewing anything in that area. I went to the dentist for that and, as he had told me before, he said to use a toothpaste for sensitive gums and let him know if it got worse.\n\nWell, about a month ago it got a lot worse. The pain became constant and the worst pain I've ever had. It was a like a dentist's drill was permanently jammed deep into the base of the tooth. No over-the-counter meds or home remedies worked to reduce it, but sometimes it would fade away on its own for a while before coming back.\n\nI went to the dentist and when he tapped the tooth with a tool to test it, the pain came back stronger and stayed there all day. He said I would need a root canal and prescribed me Ibuprofen 600MG for the pain. The root canal appointment was set for 2 weeks away.\n\nI took the Ibuprofen for 3 days. The pain didn't go away immediately but slowly lessened. By the third day, the Ibuprofen was having strong physiological effects, euphoria, a constant tingling around my mouth area and the pain was virtually gone. I stopped taking it to see if the pain would come back and it didn't. Not only was the pain gone, but the sensitivity of the gums that had been there for years was also gone. I could drink cold drinks or eat ice cream with no bad effects.\n\nI went in for the root canal appointment anyway. When I told this different dentist that the pain had gone away and I had been off the meds for 10 days, the dentist argued strongly not to do the root canal. He said even though the risk of doing it was not large, it wouldn't be worth risking anything if the pain had gone away. He tested the sensitivity of the area with cold air and since I did feel it, he said the nerve had not died.\n\nNeither dentist had ever been able to say definitively what was causing the pain and never even gave me any clear explanation on what it could be. Everything I read online said Ibuprofen is only a temporary relief for dental pain. But it's now been 30 days since the pain has all but gone away. Occasionally a very minor and very brief version of the deep tooth pain from 5 weeks ago comes back on its own or when I bite down, but overall things are better than they have been for years.\n\nCan anyone tell me, what might have been wrong with the tooth/gum, why did the Ibuprofen nearly completely cure it and should I expect the problem to eventually come back?"""

Multiple dermatologists have been seen  (1) cause completely unknown, (2) trigger unknown, and (3) treatments have been mostly unsuccessful.\n\nItching without rash was originally **mild** and **localized** ONLY to the groin and neck prior to March 2023. Itching has slowly expanded to the rest of the body and become more severe; see provided diagrams for details.\n\nAs of March 2023 itching became so severe it caused the patient difficulty with sleeping.\n\nSymptoms are cyclical  loosely on a weekly cycle. For example, itching can be mild (3/10) for 2-4 days, then severe (7/10) for 2-4 days.\n\nThere has never been a greater than 24 hour period with no symptoms, i.e. there is always some level of itchiness.\n\nA large amount of blood work was done showing no abnormalities.\n\nNo/minimal relief has been achieved with antihistamines, corticosteroid (oral/topical), and immunosuppressants (oral/topical). Some relief achieved with PredniSONE  but cannot be used long-term.\n\nTopical antibiotics and antifungals have been unsuccessful.\n\nPartial skin peel with 50% Glycolic Acid attempted in April of 2023. Relieved itching immediately. Long term effectiveness currently unknown. Itch appears to be slowly coming back.\n\nAllergist refused to see patient  stating condition was not an allergy due to localization.\n\nProceeding with more experimental treatment: (1) skin peels, (2) injections, and (3) dietary changes for minute allergies.\n\n# Lab Results:\n\nAll STD tests have come back negative. A full panel of blood tests was done to test for vitamin deficiencies, immunity issues, and viral infections  all came back normal; see lab results for more details.\n\nAn allergen patch test came back strongly positive for nickel and weakly positive for formaldehyde.

Second, I dont know if this is the right subreddit to ask this in, so sorry in advance. Also, there will be a brief mention of overdosing.\nThis all slowly started happening about 3 months ago. I woke up one day, walked downstairs to get breakfast and saw my mom sitting at the table. She said good morning and tried to start a conversation, but everything felt a little off. I cant really describe it, it was sort of like she was somebody who was isolated for their entire life trying to act like an extremely social person. The feeling lasted for about 20 minutes, every interaction seemed unnatural and awkward. \nAfter the feeling went away, I didnt experience anything like it for a couple days. About half a week later, it came back, only this time it was stronger. For about 5 hours, every time I talked to anybody, it felt like they were robots trying to have a personality. Sometimes I would physically cringe when they said or did things that were just flat out annoying. I would start to feel this more frequently and more intensely until about a month ago. I was feeling really down and took about 2 grams of Zoloft, 10,000mg of acetaminophen, and 800ish mg of diphenhydramine (The chemical found in Benadryl) As a result, it triggered a weird psychotic episode that ended up getting me in an ICU after vomiting for about 11 hours. I dont remember much of the 3-4 days after the overdose besides having extremely vivid hallucinations. Once I was allowed to leave the hospital, the feeling of everybody acting like robots trying to have a personality returned, but this time it wouldnt go away. This is sort of a weird way to describe it, but it seems like everybody has the humor of a millennial. Things I didnt pay much attention to before now seem extremely abnormal. For example, talking to animals (especially if theyre using a weird voice) talking about animals in a weird voice, nicknames/pet names, explanations such as Yeah! Mocking people or saying dialogue from stories in their voice, and pretty much and informal phrases. Its been making me withdrawal socially and all my responses are always short to people in person.  \n\nTLDR; I feel like everybody is trying to fake having a personality.

In this time I have learned a lot about him, his ADHD, and how to be more understanding of why and how he does what he does.\n\nMy boyfriend is definitely special. He got an infection that destroyed one of his heart valves at age 19. Ever since then he has had a mechanical heart valve (St. Judes Mechanical Heart Valve). Therefore, he has to take a blood thinner (Warfarin) everyday and have his blood checked every 1-2 weeks. Since he takes blood thinners he has to be careful about the things he eats and takes based on how it may differ how his body metabolizes the blood thinners. He cannot take any kind of medication for his ADHD because of this. \n\nHe used to take medication for it in high school and he didnt like how it made him feel. He said he was calm and could definitely focus more, but he overall felt like a zombie. I think it is kind of cool he does all that he does without medication. He has managed himself very well for the most part but there are some aspects of ADHD that are very obvious and can be difficult sometimes. \n\nRemembering things is a major one. He can be super forgetful even if it is something really important. Remembering to go and have his blood checked is something he typically remembers, but I try to be good girlfriend and remind him the morning and about 2 hours before on the day he needs to have it done.\n \nPaying attention can sometimes be very evident. Mainly towards me when we are together. He gives me attention and affection but there are sometimes when he will come over to hang out and become completely absorbed into his phone or tablet. This can bother me and I try to remind myself he is hyperfocusing. It's just hard when I am sitting next to him and want to talk about life or anything and cuddle while he looks at his phone and it's like he forgets that I exist. \n\nI feel like I do a fairly good job of helping him out and being understand of who he is. Things can be rough sometimes. I get frustrated and annoyed and I know he usually picks up on it because he will try to make jokes and get cuddly/lovey until I cuddle/love him back. Then I tell him whats bothering me when he gives me his full attention so I know he is listening. I know he loves me because of not only what he says and does but because of what his friends tell me too. I love him too and I wont give up on him/us as long as he never gives up on me/us.\n\nIf anyone else is in a position like mine (ADHD significant other/non-medicated) words of advice and thoughts would be nice to hear! It is great to know there is support for people with ADHD as well as their loved ones!\n"""

I think I'm experiencing what the community calls brain zaps, like little electric zaps that intermittently buzz your head. I can't even put it into words. \n\nIf I am smoking weed heavily (which I have been doing for the better part of the past week), I begin to experience the same symptoms as the effexor withdrawal. Not quite as severe but like a slightly muted version.\n\nSo to be plain, what kind of damage am I doing to be causing what's going on in my brain?\nIs the weed dulling the effects of the drugs so its inducing withdrawal? Are the neurotransmitters all wonky now to cause this?\nAm I making my mental health much worse with this combination? (Just kidding, I already know the answer to that... I'm workin on it.)\n\nThanks in advance."""
wellbutrin,https://www.reddit.com/r/ambien/comments/yznx9w/help_quitting_ambien/,b'Help Quitting Ambien',,"b'I have been on Ambien 10 mg on and off for close to 15 years. In the last 6 years, Ive taken at least 10 mg every single night, and sometimes another half in the middle of the night if I cant fall back asleep. This of course has started to get out of control, and I found myself running out faster and faster every month. The only way I made it to the next refill was to steal from my husbands Ambien who truly only uses it rarely. He of course catches on that a lot of his pills are gone and we end up arguing about my addiction.\nThis last month I asked my doctor if I could try Lunesta. I didnt say I had a problem with Ambien for fear Id be forever cut off. She prescribed 1 mg, the smallest dose of course. \nIts been 8 days of Lunesta. It did not knock me out anywhere near like Ambien, but was able to get some sleep the first half of the night, but then when I woke up around 1 am, I had half of an Ambien (5 mg). \nThe last 3 nights however, since I was off of work and had my husband around to help with the kids, I was determined not to take any Ambien. However, I did double up on my Lunesta to 2 mg. \nI slept ok-ish the first two nights. And during the day, I actually felt GREAT. Like, just truly happy again. Which really made me excited that perhaps getting off Ambien WILL help my depression (I take 150 mg Wellbutrin in the am).\nBut todayday 3. A deep wave of depression set in. Mood swings. I cant even remember what it felt like to be normal 24 hours ago. Im exhausted. No motivation. Intense headache that actually started yesterday. \nAre the withdrawals finally kicking in? How long can I expect them to last?\nI had an honest convo with my husband about my motivation to stop but that I might need to taper, as in borrow some from him, and he is completely supportive.\nAnd is it even worth it just to go on Lunesta and then have a dependency on that?? I have no data to support this other than my firsthand experience but Lunesta seems a lot weaker than Ambien, thus Im hoping the long term cognitive effects will be less.\nAny advice and or encouragement is greatly appreciated!'"

How is this possible?'",,"b""Only recently been told am BP2 & BPD 'traits' (the psych is being kind, it's not exactly a shock). My only previous meds experience was 5 days of Lexapro last year. On Day 2 I felt like just when MDMA just starts to kick in, like that excited feeling of butterflies and excitement. Then I flipped out on Day 5 and had first ever panic attack and weird agoraphobia reaction. The psych says she's had a few bipolar patients respond poorly to that particular med.\n\n\nNow I just started my 2nd ever psych med Lamictal on the lowest titrate dose (12.5mg p/d first week) as am pretty sensitive to both class A's and pharms! Now something has changed in my mind by Day 3. It's kinda like a little slice of the warm feeling I got inside when I had Tramadol. From my Dr Googling, have read that this particular opioid is known to have some antidepressant qualities - I wonder if this is maybe Lamictal's antidepressant qualities I can feel? \n\n\nHave also gone to sleep without needing to smoke any weed or have a glass of red right before bed, as I've done for the last decade or so! This was only able to happen if I took 2 Tramadol about an hour or 2 before bed.\n\n\n\n\nNow people (pysch doc included) would say this dose of Lamictal is far too small to have any such effect already, like I'm experiencing. Has anyone else experienced any immediate improvement mood and on such small dose? I've been doing some more Dr Googling on Lamotrigine and its effects in small doses. Most people seem to sit between 100-300 for bipolar. Is there anyone out there on a small dose like 25-50mg and staying stabilised at that level? Or do the effects wear off and that's why you're at 100mg?\n\n\n\nI feel like if I get the wretched rash now, will be so devastated not only because my skin is falling off and am disfigured, but also because this med's given me a glimmer of hope this week that I haven't had since I ran out of Tramadol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"""

hydrocodone-acetaminophen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9f9mv2/after_getting_my_wisdom_teeth_pulled_something/,"b'After getting my Wisdom Teeth pulled, something changed.'",,"b""Hello everybody. So I'm 27 years old, big into working out, healthy dieting. Sure I've had some anxiety throughout my life and a few panic attacks but nothing  crazy. So last Thursday I got my wisdom teeth pulled. Surgery was quick, wasn't too bad, and I was set on my way with 5/325mg Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen, 800mg Ibuprofen, and Amoxicillin. I took the meds as prescribed that day. Friday I took them as prescribed again BUT I did something stupid and drank a strong ass cup of coffee in the evening. Few hours later I had the worst panic attack I've ever had and didn't get one minute of sleep that night. I called the advice nurse and she said it was probably the Norco/caffeine. So Saturday rolls around and I've had no sleep, and decide to stop taking the pain meds. I take a few naps and that night I go to the ER because my heart rate will not go down and I have shortness of breath and constant restlessness and I refuse to not sleep another night. They take my vitals and my heart rate is 84 BPM and they look at me like I'm dumb. So I leave and go home and get 4 hours of sleep that night. Sunday I realize that I haven't had any nicotine since Wednesday night so I look up withdrawal symptoms and they match, so I get back on Nicotine and maybe things get a little better. Monday comes and I realize my diet as been shit with no vitamins and minerals so I look up potassium deficiency, very similar symptoms just like with the nicotine withdrawal. I increase my potassium amount and just like the nicotine, maybe I see an improvement? That night and the next day seem to get better and despite having anxiety about not being able to sleep from Friday night's episode I try to be as mind over matter as possible while falling asleep which has given me some decent sleep, although I felt like I had to work for it. Yesterday I saw my doctor and she said that I'm probably having a reaction to the Norco..which is a little odd since it's been 4 days since I've had one. My blood pressure was 110/80, my heart rate was 107 probably due to being nervous at the doctors office like I usually am, and she felt around my chest/back with the stethescope and said everything sounded ok, and that I didn't need to do blood work or an ECG. Even though every day seems to get a little better I still have this restless feeling and anxiety that just stays with me all day that no matter what i think about, its always there, in my chest. The thing that helps me the most is moving around and doing stuff. The left side of my jaw is still in constant but not too bad of pain so maybe that's causing anxiety all day? It's just so weird that I've never had this much panic, anxiety, shortness of breath, and restlessness in my life up until Friday night when I had that panic attack a few hours after that cup of coffee. Even on Thursday when I got my teeth pulled sure I was in pain but I had no anxiety or panic."""

Work with a parent, employed practice. Work three 12 hour shifts, parent works 4 9s, overlapping 2 days, side by side. Have been running into issues with cross coverage of patients, criticism of my workflow, patient volume, etc. parent is like 150%MGMA, sees 45-50 pts a day. I was too, 45-55 in a 12, but drowning in work, all new patients, so have locked an hour off for lunch (worked 12 straight to start) and see ~35 a day, mostly 15 min appts, scattered 30 min and procedures. Im still on guarantee, but have been upped to production for the past seven months, Avg about 72% MGMA currently.\n\nI get nonstop pestering about picking up additional walk ins (we get first dibs over the urgent care, can bill WRVU), being lazy, being slow on charts( always done within 3 business days). My notes have some thought that goes into the A&P, his notes are literally pt sick for 2 days exam belly hurt, not rigid, a&p give medicine drug ct abd/pelv  cool for him, billable, but when I see them in follow up on a Friday I have to basically start over. I refuse to sit on the damn computer taking care of the screen instead of listening to the patient, but from the 30 year vet all I get is criticism because I dont practice correctly. I refer less, do more. Maybe Im a cowboy and dont know my limits, but I can start and manage a cgm/pump, start inflixamab for severe refractory hidradenitis, start methotrexate or plaquenil for RA, trial humira if they fail for RA (rheum referral times are avg six months+ where Im at), take off a toenail, treat pulmonary histoplasmosis with f/u, etc. but it takes time. Why are you fucking with that, just send them to Pulm/pods/neuro/surg/ortho/etc well because its expensive to them, the system, and why did I bust my balls to not reduce my own fx? \n\nIm reading, probably more than ever, more than in residency. Panel is filling, I get avg 30-40 phone calls/my chart messages a day, test results, paperwork, etc.\n\nALSO when seeing cross cover patients/same day, there is the expectation that I give that z-pak and prednisone for the sinus infection (viral uri) or refill that chronic Xanax (literally never started or would start chronic daily alprazolam), and if I dont the. Im disrupting the practice and I generate complaints. I do unecessary abx, therapeutic radiation more often than I would like, and it doesnt sit right.

Just feels like the boomer parent pushes established volume through to cap out RVUSs/salary, refers excessively, doesnt spend time educating/explaining and yet I feel inadequate and insecure at times. Not everything I do is perfect, despite attempts to stick to EBM, guidelines. Its so much more complicated because I get criticized in a way the parent would NEVER talk to another colleague, but its my parent. Ive set boundaries, which help. I have my own two full time MAs that only work with me, and a 0.25 float for messages/busy day help. Any suggestions on navigating this relationship?

meloxicam,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/p9ok69/need_help_urgent_severe_sleep_deprivation/,"b'Need help Urgent, Severe Sleep Deprivation'",,"b"" Hey I recently experienced some severe sleep deprivation on top of already having a massive sleep deficit. Essentially I have insomnia from many, many complex causes.\n\nAnd long story short, I have very severe ADHD, and 4 days ago I woke up later in to the day, and I stayed up while medicated (Dextro-amphetamine sulfate + transdermal nicotine \\[I usually don't use nicotine\\]) because I had some thing that I had to get done right then and there because of deadlines. I couldn't really fall asleep during the day due to circadian rhythm being thrown off (it's worth noting that for weeks my circadian rhythm has been fucked and it's been hell trying to fix it). The following day with no sleep I didn't take any medication or caffeine, or anything to help, which would be great if I didn't have ADHD because I somehow fall asleep better on days that I medicate. And the more sleep deprived I get, the more Hyperactive I get which in return makes me more sleep deprived. So when I didn't medicate, I still couldn't sleep because I was hyperactive and using my phone a lot, and dental pain. I'm not sure if there we're any short period where I feel asleep for like 30 minutes or not tbh.\n\nBut then onto the essentially the 3rd day of like no sleep, I didn't medicate again, but managed to injure my hip. Now this is where the fact that I have scoliosis and sciatic nerve pain become very relevant. I typically sleep on my back. Not only was I having severe dental pain, (the whole right side of my jaw would randomly start throbbing with nerve pain), but I'm not exactly sure what was wrong with my low spine, but it would essentially do some restless leg syndrome-like spasms/kicks into the air own it's own involuntarily, except they we're filled with very bad instantaneous nerve pain. And it was only in my right leg, which is the one I had messed up in a severe injury a few years ago. It's also worth noting, that I actually also have straight restless leg syndrome, which not only disrupts my sleep in it's own right, it means that OTC sleep aids like Diphenhydramine and Doxylamine Succinate (and even melatonin) are probably a very bad idea, as not only are they neurotoxic due to their anticholinergic effects but will make my restless leg syndrome force me to do unconsensual mauy thai kicks at 3 am, and due to their depressant effects I probably won't recall if I even slept or not. But I think the nerve pain and kicking, was actually due to my posture, as I had to keep repositioning my messed up spine (scoliosis) and it seemed to be somewhat related to like where my pelvis was positioned. It's worth noting that I was taking Cyclobenzaprine, 10 mgs, which could possibly make the RLS worse, but I also clench my jaw in my sleep and have a lot of muscle pain, so it's kinda hard to weigh the pros and cons. And I took maybe a total of 25 mgs throughout the entire night, because I just refused to goto sleep.\n\nI also got out of bed for a little while a couple of times, to go on my phone and eat food, as I got hungry and can't sleep while hungry, and it's said you shouldn't just lie awake in bed for long periods. But then I had to brush my teeth which caused by jaw pain again. Towards this point, I was basically hallucinating, which would wake me up as I was about to fall asleep again, and my body would sometimes jolt as I was about to fall asleep, mind you I haven't had a stimulant in at least 40 hours at this point. It seemed like my heart rate and stuff was naturally just too high for my body to fall asleep despite not taking any stimulants and somehow my eyes weren't even remotely tired.\n\nI ended up drinking a beer to help calm my sympathetic nervous system and my hyperactivity despite not being a huge fan of ethanol. Even then, it took like 1.5-2 hours to fall asleep and I can't even feel like I actually feel asleep. When I woke up at like 430 pm, it felt like I hadn't sleept but I'm pretty sure I feel asleep around 230-430 am, maybe 5. When I woke up I took dextro amphetamine, just because It seems I fall asleep easier on the days I medicate in contrast to not, I then a little later took a bit more than I usually despite being heavily against it, because I'm like brain dead atm, and it really seemed to have exactly no effect, and I'm afraid that If I don't wake up my body and mind a bit more so now, then when I actually try to goto sleep my mind will start racing and I won't sleep.\n\nSo my issues have been ADHD, RLS, insomnia to begin with, dental nerve pain (from like my bottom molar to my canine, and it seems idk the fluoride in my toothpaste maybe triggers it possibly for hours), nerve pain in my right sciatic nerve, neck pain (i sleep with no pillow tho), scoliosis, a really fucked up circadian rhythm, and an abysmal amount of stress and also the effects of severe sleep deprivation.\n\nThe substances I have at my disposal are Dextro-amphetamine (I've actually been able to fall asleep while medicated easily, only because I can meditate and focus on my breathing better and i'm not hyperactive, but despite even taking a higher dosage earlier, it seems to do absolutely nothing rn, and I'm dead tired and cognitive impaired, but I still doubt if I tried to sleep rn that I could), Caffeine, 7 mg Transdermal Nicotine (no tolerance really, rarely use it to improve ADHD-related cognitive dysfunction and dyslexia but only used a handful of times), Nicotine gum that I don't use at all tbh, Acetaminophen, Naproxen, Meloxicam, Cyclobenzaprine, Diphenhydramine, Doxylamine Succinate, Ramelteon, possibly cannabis (inhaled ROA, and 0 idea what chemovar), Buspirone (probably not an option, because i have fuck all idea what this drug does besides make me lightheaded, idek if its like a stimulant, sedative, or fucking both), and possibly Alcohol. I think that's it tbh, I already took only dextro-amphetamine at 5pm really only to wake up so I'd be tired when I try to sleep but it's like I didn't even take it tbh, and my ADHD makes me hyperactive when I try to sleep, so Idk if i should try to use it to sleep or not take it at all.\n\nThe reason I can't go to my doctor is because well A. It's sunday, B. Idk when I could get an appointment. C. I have ADHD and doctors don't like prescribing sedatives because some cause paradoxical adverse reactions, and other doctors are against prescribing a sedative if you take a stimulant, even for short-term use \\[which is probably the only use for a sedative drug tbh\\].\n\nSo does anyone have the best course of action here, because I'm at a fucking loss as to what I should do. If it's not one thing, it's another like I forgot to eat and then I can't sleep because I'm hungry, or I'm having nerve pain which is essentially impossible to sleep with or at least for me it is. I'm trying to do things correctly, but it really seems like a dilemma where there's no good options and even when it seems I did everything to the best of my ability, then it just seems my body refuses to sleep for fuck all reasoning, or a reason I can't figure, and probably because I'm so god damn sleep deprived.\n\nSo please, if anyone has experience or expertise in or any fucking input at all. please advise me what to do potentially, do keep in mind there's like a 1,000 fucking variables at play. Thank you for at least reading this!"""

I was beat to the point of pure dissociation where my mind would be in a completely different place, numbing me, unable to feel the strikes.         \n\nAfter I was old enough to move out my mental health improved remarkably. Life was super easy and enjoyable. I had big goals for myself.    \nThen one day I got a viral infection. Whatever for me but it took me down pretty hard. I was pissing and coughing blood, had a 104 fever, the works. Went to a low cost clinic, they didn't know what it was and gave me Cipro then sent me on my way.  I eventually recovered but had lasting affects that I brushed off.        \nUntil I ended up in the ER from going unconscious and convulsing. They accused me of drug seeking even though I had a clean UA and never even wanted drugs? I just wanted answers. They dismissed me with a whopping bill.     \n\nI stopped going out in public as I feared I'd be forced back into the ER again.   \n\nI tried to get setup with a general dr and was told to drink more water with a shrug.    \n\nMy attacks got worse. They consumed my life and I was starting to get panic attacks at every twinge of bodily discomfort.     \n\nI was put on Lexapro and it caused my body to go into full paralysis and I felt a fear I've never experienced in my life. I couldn't move, breathe, scream, I couldn't feel anything but terror. Once again, drs brushed this off and got mad at me for wanting to stop the meds.    \n\nI went to a therapist and she told me my emotions are flat and dull and to practice how to respond to things by watching sad or funny movies. This only made me feel like a sociopath.     \n\nShe told me she thinks we won't make much progress unless I get back on meds and referred me to a psychiatrist that never even had the time of day to fit me in.     \n\nAnd my health is still deteriorating. I feel so sick everyday. Muscle chills, fevers, cold sweats, fainting, migraines, diarrhea, vomiting, loud ringing in my ears, vision is vibrating, day long severe vertigo attacks.    \n\nI've seen countless specialists and doctors. I have so many diagnoses. I'm a hopeless case and doctors really just want to yeet me back to mental health so I've given up.      \n\nI was able to find others like me with similar stories, similar diagnoses. They seem to be in the same boat.  Some finally figure it out but most are lost.     \n\nAnd now I have an extreme fear of medical professionals. The fact they will push meds on you but won't help you if you react to them scares the shit out of me."""
aspirin,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13ybr5n/tw_aspirin_overdose/,b'[TW] Aspirin Overdose?',,"b""So. I, 14F, have struggled with severe depression for upwards of two years- as a result, I have attempted suicide by overdose three times. However, all of these times were over a year and a half ago...is it possible to still have side effects, ie vertigo, from such a long time ago? I took 3600mg of aspirin, which I know is not good, but ever since, I've been experiencing tinnitus and extreme bouts of dizziness, daily. I'm in a much better place now mentally, and have been in treatments for the last year, but I never seemed to be able to figure out why I was constantly dizzy, until my therapist suggested that it might be vertigo. The reason why it was so difficult to come to a conclusion about this is because I also began struggling with anorexia at the time (again, things are much better now), which, for obvious reasons, will induce dizziness. But, now I'm wondering if it's due to my frankly long-forgotten attempts at overdose. I haven't told a doctor, as my physician is...not my favorite, and I haven't had a psychiatrist appointment for a while, so I figured I should ask here for insight.

Countless doctors/specialists and all of them are stumped.',Image905.jpg,"b'Hi there, kinda at my wits end here so thought it couldn\'t hurt to post and see if anyone had any insights on this one. It\'s a bit of a saga so I\'ll try to make it concise as possible.  \n\n\nIn 2017 I got the mother of all sinus infections. It \'cleared up\' after a bout of nasal steroids and a week in bed but ever since I was left with dark blue rings on the inside of my eyes (pic below), near constant zapping pins-and-needles around the same area and my forehead and near constant post nasal drip. That same year I had eight courses of antibiotics with no effect.  \n\n\nIn 2018 an ENT took one look at me and put me under the knife with a septoplasty and turbinate reduction surgery. Symptoms remained.  \n\n\nIn 2019 I saw an allergist who said I was mildly allergic to rye grass which was followed by a year of immunotherapy injections. No change. Later saw a second allergist who reported I wasn\'t allergic to anything.  \n\n\nThe same year I saw another ENT for a second opinion who thoroughly examined my sinuses, looked at my bloodwork along with a catscan and concluded everything was A-ok and whatever was going on was definitely NOT sinus related. He hypothesised I might have a condition called Midfacial Segment Pain Syndrome - a \'poorly understood condition\'. He put me on 150mg Amitriptyline which helped with the pins and needles slightly but post nasal drip remained.  \n\n\n2020 - I was referred to a neurologist who did an MRI and concluded my brain was in \'pristine condition\'. She referred me to a pain specialist.  \n\n\n2021 - The pain specialist performed pulsed radiofrequency on the nerves around my sinus and forehead area. This went someway to stop the zapping, pins-and-needles sensation but the post nasal drip is still worse than ever.  \n\n\nAside from the Midfacial Segment Pain Syndrome diagnosis, the pain specialist explained the most likely cause of this issue by the swelling from the initial sinus infection damaging the nerves around the site of the infection causing neuralgia (which makes the most sense so far). The concerning thing though was that when I asked him if that\'s the cause of the constant post nasal drip and rhinitis he said quite confidently that it was not.  \n\n\nSo while the pins-and-needles have died down somewhat, the dark blue rings around the interior of my eyes remains and I\'m going still going through a box of tissues every few days from the constant rhinitis.  \n\n\nAnyway! That\'s my tale of woe.

As soon as I open the bottle I start crying and freaking out. I had planned to take it for the first time today at 8am but it is now 11am and I am both equally as upset that I have not been able to take it as I have been pretty much freaking out over it for the last 2 hours.\n\nI think my biggest fear is of being ""high"", having weird body sensations and it also causing more anxiety. Also the fact that it\'s ""long acting"" scares me also becuase if I am having a bad time the bad time will be drawn out. Atleast if I am having a panic attack in my sober self they are kinda just made up in my brain right, so I can calm myself down where if a medication causes me to panic I can\'t just remove the medication from my body or stop it if it starts to freak me out. \n\nAlso a lot of the things I am terrified of (the covid vaccine was one, and the fact I have to get my wisdom teeth out is another) are things that I HAVE to do. Where seeing as this medication isn\'t something I HAVE to do (I\'ve been alive 29 years without right?) I am struggling to just force myself to take it. \n\nI have never taken any sort of mood disorder drugs before despite having depression since I was 15yo, anxiety my whole life but it was never a problem and never realized I had anxiety until I was about 21-23yo when I developed panic attack disorder after taking codeine (for a minor surgery I had, ended up in the ER dept thinking I was dying) as well as I had a bad trip on smoking green around 19-20 that I believe was the moment that panic attacks became a problem in my life.\n\nI largely choose therapy over medications for my mental health issue which I had great success with until covid happened as I have found it extremely hard to ""put my mask back on"" and return to ""normal life"" post covid. \n\nThis self exploration thorough out covid led to my ADHD diagnosis and subsequently the desire to try medication as I am struggling to maintain  being a member of society.  \n\nI know I am probably overthinking this massively. I over thought covid and didnt sleep at night from worrying about catching it, yet when I caught it, it sucked but I was fine.\n\nIt\'s hard to sometimes gauge how full on the side effects will be, like elevated heart rate, I can\'t find information on HOW elevated.\n\nWas anyone else this terrified and can offer some advice? \n\nOr can compare their experience to something I can quantify, like drinking coffee/energy drink?\n\n**TLDR:** First time taking any medication for anything brain/mood etc related. Extremely anxious over taking it. Need reassurance or a slap or something.'"
codeine,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/11w5v97/help_multiple_doctors_havent_found_whats_wrong/,"b""Help! Multiple doctors & haven't found what's wrong""",,"b'29 year old female - below is a very detailed overview of my health. I am looking for anybody who can potentially lead me in which direction I should turn to next.\n\nShort Version: I\'ve had the same chronic pain in my left upper abdominal quadrant for 3 years, since March 2020. The pain is primarily located anteriorly just underneath the rib cage in the mid-clavicular line. The pain seems to be gradual throughout the day, with it being pretty severe at night, depending on what I am doing or how I am sitting. The pain will occasionally radiate to the back, up towards the sternum, and down towards the pubis and the groin on the left side. The pain is mostly positional, meaning I can relieve it by standing up, walking around, or lying down because it is most severe when I am sitting, whether that be driving, on the couch, at a table, etc. There is nothing that takes my pain away other than adjusting positions, but mostly laying down. No pain medications relieve my pain. (a detailed list of things I\'ve tried for pain will be at the bottom) I have had multiple imaging studies including a CTA of the abdomen/pelvis that showed possible Nutcracker syndrome with a 17 degree angle between the aorta and SMA with dilation of the left renal vein. I was evaluated by UW Madison for consideration of an autotransplant of my left kidney. However, after I underwent a venogram which showed equal pressures between the renal vein and IVC, Dr. Foley did not want to offer the surgery.  \nI also have had irregular menstrual cycles since I began having periods. Within the last few years, I feel like I almost get the ""period flu"" or have more PMDD symptoms before I\'m about to get it.\n\nLong Version: This all started in March 2020, my office had just moved to working from home with the Coronavirus outbreak. I hadn\'t gotten a desk/office chair for home yet, so I started out by sitting on my couch with my laptop in my lap for a couple of weeks. After about 3 weeks in I started to notice a bad pain in my left side. It was like a pinching/burning pain and it seemed to come on slowly the more I sat in the same position. My immediate thought was that it was like a ""side stitch"" or a cramp from the way I was kind of slouching and not sitting upright in a chair. I quickly made sure to get a desk and chair to see if it helped resolve the pain. Unfortunately, it did not. The more the days went on, the worse the pain was getting and it only seemed to be when I was sitting for longer periods of time. I had to start getting up more frequently and walking around or switching positions. I went to a chiropractor which did not alter the pain in any sort of way. The same chiropractor also tried a few laser therapy sessions over the affected area as well, with no relief.  \nThe pain was gradually becoming a permanent thing, and it became painful to wear a bra due to the pressure it caused around my ribs/where the pain is. I was trying everything I could think of to relieve the pain. At first I tried ibuprofen, Tylenol, heat, ice, heating pad, icy hot, cbd muscle rub, cannabis,  \nThe pain continued on and I started talking to my then primary doctor, I had an x-ray done of my ribs 04/2020 - which showed normal. I then had a chest x-ray and chest CT done 05/2020 - also normal. The pain continued through that fall and into 2021. I had c\\*v\\*d for the first time 11/22/2020.  \nIn spring of 2021 I had c\\*v\\*d again in March, so almost right at 90 days since first infection. I then started to get more serious about finding out what was wrong because I started to have a new pain in my left collarbone. It seemed like the whole bone would ache and the more I moved my arms(I had started cosmetology school in the fall of 2020) the worse the pain got. Sometimes the lightest touch from my shirt, a tank top, my cosmetology apron, or even my seat belt resting on my collarbone would cause immense pain. This lasted about a couple weeks at first, then it would go away for weeks/months, then it would come back randomly. I went to the emergency room one day in 03/2021 because I was so tired of being in so much pain, and had more chest x-rays done, which came back clear and normal. The collarbone pain has not bothered me for about 6 months now, but I have also been pretty sedentary since then. Fast forward to 06/15/2022 after my third round of c\\*v\\*d the beginning part of June, I started having the following symptoms for a month straight. I was physically so unwell, I could barely get up from laying down most of the time and could not go outside due to not being able to tolerate the heat, until I finally asked my doctor to run more labs, which all came back normal: dizziness, night sweats, severe intolerance to heat, severe loss of appetite and nausea, and new body odor(previously never had an issue with body odor). Since then, I have had periodic episodes that last weeks with severe loss of appetite(cannabis is the only way I can eat most of the time), some mild nausea(never any vomiting), lethargy, feeling hopeless, very mild night sweats, hotter body temperature while sleeping. And then I\'ll have weeks where I feel fine except my usual pain. On 01/26/2023 I traveled to Punta Cana for my sisters wedding. I suffered through the pain of sitting for an extended period of time on the plane ride. While there, I virtually had no appetite my first night and the next morning/afternoon. And then my appetite came back and my pain went almost completely away for almost 4 days, until I went back home. I ate Taco Bell at the airport and had almost immediate pain from sitting on the plane again, and the pain has been present every day since.\n\n01/25/2023 Urology consult: CHIEF COMPLAINT: left sided pain; concern for Nutcracker syndrome.

She told me that I lost 7 pounds on the last 2 weeks and of my stomach is still giving me such pain and I'm getting no symptom relief for anxiety or depression, I need to stop taking it. She wants me to just go cold turkey and be without any antidepressant for a while. She actually told me that she doesn't think that any medication is going to help me at this point. That is really scary to hear from your psychiatrist. I knew the appointment wouldn't go well bit I didn't expect it to go as harshly as it did.  It left me more hopeless than I already was. She said if it were gonna work I would have been able to tell something by this point. Which is not the opinion of most of the posts I read on here. Any thoughts from my fellow subs?"""
influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/11fqn6x/its_been_nineteen_months_now_and_i_now_feel/,"b""It's been nineteen months now, and I now feel entirely estranged from the only people who ever mattered to me.""",,"b'tldr; I had a friend group who I deeply cared for and loved, there was argument with one friend back in the summer of 2021 due to me being assaulted. The entire group now won\'t associate with me or acknowledge me anymore.  ...Can I fix things?  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI honestly do not know how much about myself I should preface this post with, and I could write paragraphs on that alone... I\'ll try to keep this part brief. My parents had me tested for ADHD when I was a child but I was not diagnosed with ADHD because I wasn\'t hyperactive, I was always inattentive/distracted. Because of that, I grew up assuming everything was always directly my fault and my fault alone. My elementary school knew something was different about me, and elected me to go to enrichment classes thinking I was ""too smart and getting bored"" with the main materials. I saw that as a punishment for doing things wrong. I was diagnosed with anxiety in my teen years. At nineteen, I had a horrific experience with human traffickers and the police resulting in a distressing life-long injury. This also resulted in me breaking as a person, but wanting to change. To actually have friends. That year, I ended up joining what would not only be the only friend group I was ever really a part of, but the only time I felt accepted and loved by anybody. Our group was ride-or-die, with everything. Understanding with everything. I only disclosed the event that happened to me to two friends in the group, and as far as I know they kept it a secret and never shared it, trusting me to share it with others if I chose to.  \n\n\nSix years later, we\'re still basically a family, seeing and doing things almost every single day. The only annoyances I ever, ever gave off with things like constantly interrupting people and wanting to comment/respond to everything every person said, but I learned with time to calm myself and not interrupt, to the point where I rarely did it at all and if I did, one friend would give me a blunt, ""shut up"" but in a way to just quickly get out a, ""please let me/them finish what\'s being said"", it wasn\'t rude, and I respected this friend for telling me to shut up if I needed to. Our group had quite a few social misfits and neurodivergent  friends within it, so it was a wonderful combination of us learning to proper socialize together and not getting frustrated by one another\'s symptoms or quirks.  \n\n\nI was one of the first members of our group of friends to get their own home, it was located central within the city, and for the next nine years my living room was basically the gathering place for everybody. I loved it so much. I never had to plan anything I didn\'t want to, I didn\'t have to remember any events or special dates, all of my friends would just come to my house and hang out, play video games, watch tv, or go out as a group. If I was feeling overwhelmed or exhausted, I could just wish everybody a good night and go to my bed. I was living the best years of my life. Even as friends started getting their own homes, and starting their own romantic relationships and families, everyone was still hanging out at my place usually, even if we were planning to hang out at a friend\'s house people would just come to mine first and I\'d get a ride with them to the place we were going.  \n\n\nThen, Covid lockdowns happened at the start of 2020. My entire routine I had fallen in love with was destroyed. Friends couldn\'t visit anymore, and I was isolated with my roommate. My roommate... he was never my friend, but he became a member of the friend group and when I needed a roommate the whole group just excitedly thought it\'d be the best idea for him to move in... It was a horrific nightmare. And now I was not only isolated with him and none of our friends, but I had no means to ask him to move out. I couldn\'t even evict him if I wanted to. It was really, really bad. Throughout my life, I obsessed about having things always be clean and in order, just so I can remember and keep track of where things actually are. Living with this roommate had my anxiety through the roof, developing paranoia and compulsive behaviours just trying to co-exist with this uncooperative, selfish oaf. Every morning I would come downstairs to find my house in a mess, everything taken out and around, him occupying my entire living room to himself and me at the end of the day putting it ALL back away and cleaning up after him. Every single day. Just every day of the Covid lockdowns it was a routine of waking up, avoiding my roommate, and then spending an hour or two before bed cleaning everything up after him. He constantly damaged and broke things in my house and parts of the house itself. My sanctuary that I had developed for me and my friends was now being gradually destroyed by this roommate. My only, ONLY sources of sanity were being able to see my two parents once a week (by myself, no siblings of family, we could only visit one at a time) and one of our best mutual friends would pop in to socialize once or twice a week. So I admittingly would just dump hours of conversation onto him just to have anybody to talk to.  \n\n\nDuring the summer of 2021, I managed to join an online learning course and got a two week placement at the front desk of one of the city\'s biggest hotels. After over a year of lockdowns, my anxiety was through the roof expecting to just stand behind a desk for twelve hours a day, unpaid, waiting for the 40-second interactions with guests (we had almost none due to Covid of course). I would spend most of my shift obsessively looking for things to do or clean or organize. The hotel staff loved how much ""initiative I had"" but I was honestly just trying to keep myself stimulated so I wouldn\'t have a breakdown in the hotel.  \n\n\nAfter the first week, I made the poor decision to meet someone from a dating app, desperately wanting a person just to talk to, in person. They assaulted me. Because of my experience when I was nineteen, I did not report it to the police this time, I only went to the doctor to see if I was clean and not physically damaged any further. But as this was happening, it was also around the time the second Covid shot was available AND the Canadian truckers were protesting. These two details are what caused the argument.  \n\n\nThe night before the mutual good friend of my roommate and I came over for his weekly visit, there was an incident where my roommate came home while I was in the bathroom, having an anxiety attack over not being able to finish my two week placement at the hotel and how every time I tried to use the bathroom, I was profusely bleeding. He, as usual, slams the front door and begins stomping around and without even realizing it I started saying out loud, ""OH HERE WE GO! STOMP, STOMP, STOMP, STOMP, STOMP, STOMP, STOMP, STOMP, ST-"" until he stormed to the bathroom door and knocked so hard I thought it was going to come off its hinges giving an enraged, ""HEY! WHAT\'S THE \\*\\*\\*\\*ING MATTER? HUH?"" and I snapped with a, ""IT\'S YOU. IT\'S ALL YOU."" We argued through the closed door as I tried to clean up the blood and the moment I opened the bathroom door, I saw his rage shrink into shock. I sobbed as I told him that I can\'t take it anymore, he never listens, he just ruins everything I have that I spent so many years cherishing and taking care of. We agreed that he would move out. It was stressful, but it was finally done. He was finally getting out of my house.  \n\n\nThe next day when our friend comes by to hang out, I was up in my bedroom and my roommate was occupying the living room. When I heard them having a conversation downstairs, I thought to myself, ""Oh thank god, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ is here."" and stopped what I was doing to go downstairs and hang out. As I\'m coming down the stairs, my roommate and our mutual friend are currently discussing the Canadian trucker protests and anti-vaxxers when they notice me and my roommate gives a, ""Hey! You get your second Covid shot yet?"" At this point, the second shot had been available for about two weeks but I was so occupied with online classes, the job placement, and then the second assault that I hadn\'t reminded myself to get it yet. I tell them, ""No, I\'ve been pretty occupied recently and haven\'t gotten it yet.""  \n\n\nThat\'s when it happened. I had never, ever seen my good friend ever behave this way before in the sixteen total years I\'ve known him now up to this point. He becomes angry and short/blunt with me, like a police officer interrogating a murderer, demanding details on why I didn\'t get the shot the day it was first made available to me. Accusing me of being scared of getting the vaccine. Accusing me of supporting the trucker protests. The longer this drilling towards me went on and on, I tried to dance around the fact that I was just \\*\\*\\*\\*d a couple of days ago, but to have one of my best friends who I care for suddenly turn into Mr Hyde and accuse me of all of these things he knows aren\'t true, he knows how much I oppose anti-vaxxers. He eventually breaks me and I blurt out that I was just \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* assaulted and anemic from lose of blood, wanting results back from my doctor and my red blood cells to get back up before receiving the vaccine.  \n\n\nHe said, ""I think you just have a victim complex."" and everything went silent. I froze up, I was completely paralyzed in mind and body. I had just told one of my best friends that I was assaulted and he said he thinks I just have a victim complex. I literally could not think... it was just repeatedly echoing in my mind. I don\'t know how much time passed, it could have been an entire minute, it could have been two seconds, I just do not know. But the silence breaks as my friend stands up and says, ""Do you just want me to leave? Because you\'re just standing there doing nothing."" This snapped me out of it, I quickly became apologetic and begged him to stay, trying to do whatever I could to appease him because of how much his friendship and respect mattered to me. I sit down on the other couch and remain silent for the rest of the hangout, which didn\'t last much longer. My friend and roommate chatted for about ten minutes before my friend decided to leave.  \n\n\nMy friend never came back to my house.  \n\n\nOver the next few months, in our Messenger group chat that we\'ve had for over a decade, any time I had anything to say, my friend would either belittle or shame me in front of everyone else. When it came time for my birthday, everyone claimed they were too busy to just play some games online together (since the lockdowns were still in effect, we couldn\'t have more than one guest at a time, and since the argument happened I had NO visitors at all). I was as flexible as possible, it didn\'t matter what day, what time, I just wanted to play some video games with my best friends, even if just online. Not a single friend wanted to. It was the whole, ""I\'m planning an event."" ""I can\'t make it."" ""But I didn\'t even say when it is..."" thing.  \n\n\nCome 2022, the lockdowns are finally over. My friends are out of their homes and doing things again. My exroommate is invited to everything, I\'m not even told they\'re happening. Any time I saw any of them in public, they were cold and indifferent towards me when we usually cheer and hug. Now three friends in the Messenger group chat are shaming me any time I post, one of which keep making threats to leave because of me (I wasn\'t even posting that much... maybe one thing every week or two, usually relevant to a discussion they were currently having). I was still doing things for their birthdays and getting them gifts... when it comes time for my birthday in 2022, not a single one of them even posted a, ""happy birthday"" on my Facebook wall. Nothing.  \n\n\nIt got to the point where the feeling of being rejected by the only people who ever mattered to me, and how much they mattered to me, became too much and after one of their snarky remarks at me I just left the group chat. Any attempt since to reach out to any of my friends, even the better ones, was met with silence or suddenly short, one-word responses. So I gave up.  \n\n\nI would finally, after all of this time, receive a recommendation to visit a psychiatrist who properly diagnosed my ADHD. I wasn\'t believing it, because my parents tried to have me tested as a kid and I was told I wasn\'t hyperactive so I couldn\'t have ADHD. My god though, as we discussed things, it was starting to make more and more sense. I had ADHD my entire life and suffered as a result of it not being recognized and treated. I had always believed that I was just a lazy idiot and anything I was late for or not remembering was due to me personally, which is why I grew up anxiously trying to make sure that I wasn\'t forgetting anything or losing anything. I was also diagnosed with complex PTSD with this psychiatrist. Not from the two assaults, but from the six years (two of which were Coivid lockdowns) I had my exroommate living with me, gaslighting me, and creating such a chaotic environment out of my sanctuary.  \n\n\nAfter trying different stimulants and nonstimulants, I am currently prescribed Adderall and have been on it for the past three months but still don\'t feel it is right for me, as it makes me more conscious of what I\'m doing when I start to become inattentive/distracted, making me snap into compulsive behaviours. I just... I just feel like my exroommate was lying about me to the friend group, and the friend group just accepted everything he claimed at face value and didn\'t even come to ask me for my side of things, let alone if any of it was true. But now they think I am a lying, unreliable drunkard when in reality I\'m an anxious ADHD \\*\\*\\*\\* survivor. I have been discussing things for the past few months with my councillor, who has been wonderful, but my mind is just locked in this state where I just can\'t stop reminiscing about what happened. At this point, the argument with my friend happened nineteen months ago. The last time I tried reaching out to anyone from the group was eight months ago. I have lost all sense of who I was and just spend hours every day now, just sitting there in my own head, just letting the days, weeks, and months go by. I am entirely crippled without my friend group and have come to appreciate how much I relied on them for everything in my life. I simply do not do anything for myself, I only did things when I was doing them for or with others.  \n\n\nI have spent so many months just having complete emotional breakdowns, being alone, and unable to feel comfortable in my own home anymore... that at the start of 2023 I noticed that I was ""emotionally dead"". I wouldn\'t describe myself as ""being a zombie"" or ""being on auto-pilot"", but I really only have a sense of myself in the immediate moment with no desire or drive to do anything but just... exist.  \n\n\nAt this point, I believe trying to explain to any of them about my ADHD diagnoses, let alone the assault, is pointless. I\'ve known these people for sixteen years, I have seen what it looks like when a person is no longer welcomed within the group. I own the things I did, I know I handled the exroommate situation extremely poorly, I know I should have gotten the vaccine the day it was available, I know I shouldn\'t have frozen up at my friend, I admit those things are my fault and mine alone, no one is responsible for ""making me"" do anything. I want to forgive how hostile my friend was at me, now knowing I have ADHD I even believe I likely misinterpreted things and assumed rejection when there might not have been any? I have spent the past twelve months obsessing over this every single day and I just need some sort of solution, even if it\'s my friends confirming that they no longer want to associate with me, no matter what their reason is. I just want closure, if anything. But I would love to be accepted back.  \n\n\nBut a part of me tells me I\'m displaying signs of stockholm syndrome BECAUSE these have been my only friends my entire life and they matter so much to me.  I don\'t care. I don\'t care if it takes groveling at their feet and calling myself the scummiest scum who ever scummed. I don\'t care if I\'m treated like shit the entire time. It\'s not even the sense of being excluded and them doing everything without me now, I truly do adore their company and love them for who they are.  \n\n\nMaybe it\'s best to just... let it go and not burden them with my presence ever again. I don\'t know. I\'ve thought about this for an entire year every day and I just do not know. Every story I\'ve read of other people with ADHD losing their friends due to miscommunication or too much time going by just leave me feeling that, this is it. This was the only time in my life I was ever going to have friends I cared about like this and I\'m just going to have to learn to be alone from this point forward. If anyone has any advice for someone in their mid30s to fix a situation like this, or how to cope with it, it would be greatly appreciated. I simply cannot think of a solution on my own, and my councillor thinks it would be best to make new friends... Making new friends as someone with ADHD and anxiety in my mid30s just isn\'t going to be possible. I do not see how, even when forcing myself to attend things like karaoke at college or pride events within the city. It is just beat into my mind that I am awkward and annoying, and my old friend group were the only ones capable of tolerating that.'"

Im sharing this because I dont think Ive ever experienced anything like it before, and would like to know if any of you have had something similar. \n\nIve been asked by both NTs and NDs throughout my life (friends, dates, etc) if Im on the spectrum, but never really looked at the startlingly obvious bigger picture of life history, family and comorbidities until a few days ago when I was in the middle of a horrendously painful sensory overload that lasted 5 days. It was a bit of an epiphany. \n\nMy entire sensorium from Friday to Tues night was basically jacked to volume level 11. I spent all of Sat/Sun in a dark bedroom. Any amount of light hurt my eyes. Smells were super intense. When the cat used its litter box across the apartment I noticed. I tried to eat a food I eat normally (blueberries, granola and kefir) and I was extremely nauseated. Sounds hurt my ears. I couldnt think. I typed all my symptoms into Google and found that this sensory overload looks an awful lot like autistic burnout but can occur in Tourettes (which my brother was diagnosed with) and ADD (which I was diagnosed with, amongst other ASD comorbidities like anxiety, depression, dyslexia, infrequent absence seizures, and an eating disorder). \n\nThis episode came after a week of WAY too much stimulation, 10 hrs on a plane, 24 hrs in a party house of 40 people Id never met before, a 500-person math conference and the afterparty and several nights of going out with colleagues who were in town for it during 2nd week of new job. And then the overwhelm hit me like a freight train. \n\nYesterday (Tues) I was still quite sick through midmorning and was dry heaving over the toilet.  Then everything suddenly relented by 85% but I couldnt *think*. It was like Id been hit in the head and my ADD was uncontrollable even with medication. \n\nToday I woke up to crystal clear cognition and a sense of calm and optimism, and was able to do a super intense hour-long 1:1 meeting about my task of overhauling a blockchain data analytics system with my FAR more experienced coworker (Ive been in the space only a year and this is a new job of 3 weeks ago, first in the space; hes been in it for 7 years). I didnt miss a beat. I came to a solution. It was really complex DeFi analytics code. And I was startled by this high-functioning flow state. No impostor syndrome (crypto is mostly dudes on the technical side and Im literally the only one on my team without facial hair), no weirdness, I just dove in and connected a lot of dots. \n\nIt was like my brain went mega ASD symptomatic, and then popped out rebalanced and clean and able to hyper focus on technical problems like I did as a kidsome of the best parts of it, in my opinion. The clarity is bizarre and wonderful. My ADD calmed TF down tooits a 2/10.\n\nHas this happened to you? What just happened? What is this? \n\nAny insight is greatly appreciated. Im still learning about my brain in this new context, which would explain 90% of my eccentricities, bluntness, social shortcomings, sensory intolerances and sensitivities, etc. Scheduling an evaluation soon.'"

I have been on benzodiazepines since I was 12 yo and am now 34. I had a 7 year break where I self medicated because I moved to a new state and was using alcohol, research chemicals (Etizolam, Flualprazolam, Clonazolam, and one that was a Valium based, possible Diclazopam or something like) and the 4 most common prescribed (Diazepam, Clonazepam, Lorazepam and Alprazolam). I have seizure disorder with Petite Mal siezures. I have not been diagnosed with epilepsy because I have an allergic reaction to Dilantin and Tegrotol and Kepra made me feel that sensation in my head that occurs when my seizures come on, a pressure change and an electrical feeling in my brain. At least I figure that is the reason I have a seizure disorder diagnosis instead of an epileptic diagnosis. The RC benzodiazepines are usually stronger and have an extended half life compared to the 4 regulars. So I have been trying to get back into doctor care since my move here 7 years ago and have had some luck, yet it seems that this state does not like to or even consider prescribing benzodiazepines. I also am sometimes too honest with doctors, meaning I attempt to explain to them how and why I self medicated with substances they tend to look down upon, e.g Alcohol. And they have a hard time putting me on the medication that works for me.\n\n To get my prescription back in this state I had to have an extensive surgery which occurred after I was attacked, hit in the head with a metal pipe And thrown over an overpass on to a freeway. The worst part is that it was done by three people whom I considered friends and/ or at least trust able individuals that I knew very well. I had a closed skull fracture, an intracranial hemorrhage and extensive damage to my frontal lobe. They had previously put me on Diazepam 5mg x3\n\nafter a TBI injury in which I was a passanger in a car which was hit by a cement truck and the drdoseswas killed in February 2020 and I simply could not find a doctor that would refill my script. After my initial surgery for the closed skull fracture in September of 2021 I was put on .5mg of Lorazepam x2 and then x3. After my second surgery, to replace the left half of my skull with titanium screws, they asked me if I would like to change my med to Clonazepam and I agreed because from the age of 12 to 17 I was on Clonazepam, which is from adolescence to adult prospectively. I feel a nomal life is not attainable without benzodiazepines. And IMO, it sucks. All I want is to be a productive citizen and take care of my family as I believe I should be able to do as a Man. I have tried everything else, SSRI\'s, low doses of Antipsychotics like Seroquel and Zyprexa, as well asBuspar.. The list goes on.\n\nToday, two months after my Surgery to replace my skull, my medication list is: Clonazepam .5 x2, Pregabalin 100mg x3, Metropolol half 25mg tab x2, Butalbatal, Cafe and APAP 325mg - 50mg - 40mg every 4 hours, and Tramadol 100 mg every 6 hours (for breakthrough pain). My PCP (Primary care physician) is evil to me, treats me with comments such as ""The hospital would not have released you if you were in pain as you claim"", my surgical procedure was scheduled as an overnight stay and I ended up in the hospital for 3 weeks. I was put in ICU after a CT showed that my brain was still swelling and needed to be drained of blood/ fluid, which was about a pint and some. I was in ICU for 4 days until my subsequent CT showed that my swelling had subsided and was released 4 days later, my nurse explaining that the hospital was extremely pack from the new Omicron variant Covid virus. She encouraged me to go the ER if anything occurs that seems to warrant a doctors care. He refuses to refill my medications and I call my Neurosurgery office and they tell him to refill my meds. He does but changes my doses e.g the butalbital from every 4 hours to every 6 hours and only 3 days a month. I could understand the the change if I was further in my recovery from surgery and/ or wanted me to taper off the medication if it was no longer needed. He simply wouldn\'t Refill my Pregabalin, which I was on before the initial surgery for almost two weeks after I ran out, which had my so ill that I was moments away from calling an ambulance to get to the ER. He stated that he would not refill until he saw me, which was two more weeks out. I also have a med manager (PNP - psychiatric nurse practioner) who I have a controlled substance contract with, whom I have met with twice in between my PCP visits who has givClonazepam each visit and have passed both. So what, he needs to make sure I am clean 5 days after my last PNP visit before he will refill my medication? My PNP will only handle the Clonazepam and told me that my PCP, who is only a resident, has to do the rest of my medication. Even though some are controlled or at least scheduled, she must not want them attached to the contract, possibly because I would have the risk of losing them if I violate the contract.\n\nI see my neurosurgeon tomorrow, and I am going to explain this situation that is keeping held down, in scale level 7 pain, and still under General Anxiety Disorder and Panic Attack because of the dose of Clonazepam does not sufficient for my ailments.\n\n Does anyone have any suggestions? I believe my GAD will be in better control if first I help the pain I\'m feeling and also get the medication for the Panic Attacks put to the correct dose which will last a full day. The questions in my head include should I inquire about taking my Clonazepam three times instead of the current x2? Also, when I was on 5mg Diazepam x3 is the last time I felt comfortable in my own skin. Should I inquire about a medication change? I am also in such pain without anything refilled or a different prescription to help, that I broke down on Saturday and took 4mg of Suboxone. Screw Suboxone but I believe it will look better than Heroin or Oxycodone showing up. Because I am not perscribed, I risk losing my GAD Panic medication (Clonazepam) and him not refilling my other medication. Should just be completely honest with my neurosurgeon? About why I took the Suboxone, if they test me? I would normally hope they won\'t test because my PNP has already, but I think telling them that I used something because of the pain and lack of medication that is on my med list created by them. Really though, I hope telling them will show he amount of pain I am experiencing during my recovery and instead of losing the meds I need to push on, they will hopefully understand and make the correct adjustments.\n\n I know this is a Benzo sub reddit, but I am allergic to APAP and the Butalbital and Caffeine make it so I can handle it with minimal allergic reactions. And the Tramadol really doesn\'t touch my pain much. Specifically the Clonazepam, the dose does not work but for some time after taking meds, which my schedule is A.M. meds 7:30 am which I take all, 1:30 Pregabalin and .5 Clonazepam, and 7:30 P.M. which would be everything except the Clonazepam but ATM is only Lyrica and Metropolol. By 6 P.M. my anxiety and panic and pain are out of control. I forgot to mention that I also suffer from acute insomnia since the attack and my PCP refuses to refill that as well. So I don\'t get much sleep at all. My current medication issues are that through out the day, even though I have some relief from anxiety and panic, the pain remains and most definitely effects my anxiety.\n\nMy appointment is tomorrow. Maybe switching the pain meds will help better than refilling? I know a x3 of Clonazepam will most certainly help. Will Diazepam help better with GAD, Panic and Sleep? Please help with anything you guys are thinking that could help. Thank you for reading and God bless you all.\n\n\nSent withProtonMailSecure Email.'"
clindamycin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/11fzu3l/2_allergies_back_to_back_red_tattoo_ink_and/,b'2 Allergies Back to Back (Red Tattoo Ink and Clindamycin)',,"b'So, I got a black and red hand sized tattoo on February 13th. Was told to take the wrapping off 4 hours later, wash it with soap, and moisturize it (every 4 hours). Ive healed tattoos before with zero issue, once with Saniderm and once without. It looked great the 14th. It looked great the 15th. The 16th the skin started getting super tight and pulling, and the black still looked good, but something was off about the red ink. The center of the bursts of red were pulling away from each other and leaving holes? This kept progressing until there was basically no skin in the red, and my leg started getting irritated and painful with some signs of pus. I kept washing and moisturizing as she said and it was still really tight and hot and uncomfortable. By the night of February 18, I knew I had to go to Urgent Care or the hospital. \n\nThe morning of the 19th, I go to Urgent Care. Its infected and Im diagnosed with Cellulitis. Sent home with Clindamycin to take for 7 days, and Ibuprofen to take as needed. Told to rest and elevate my leg to help with swelling and pain. She also tells me to start using Eucerin cream and wrapping my leg in saran wrap for a few days. By the end of the 7 days, all of the redness is almost gone and those open pieces of skin have scabbed over- great. The 26th I feel better and am ready to move on. Wrong.\n\nThe 27th I am good all day and then when Im crawling into bed, I notice that my leg is a little itchy under the tattoo. I feel like its the red healing so I scratch around the bottom of the tattoo, near the ankle, completely avoiding actual tattoo. \n\nI go to sleep and wake up and notice almost a rash around the tattoo? Not actually around the tattoo but where I scratched a few inches away from the tattoo under and to the left of it. Its like a light pink color and I think its from scratching and maybe going too hard with it while I was sleeping. I thought it would go away once I moisturized and calmed the skin a little. It just irritated it more. I go to work and Im on my feet all day so I assume that its going to be red all day anyway. I get home and shower and look and I have a rash developing all over my body at this point. The leg is getting worse and itchier, and now my thighs and arms have a kinda similar looking rash. I take an antihistamine and go to sleep to see if that helps.\n\nWake up the morning of March 1st with no improvement, so I go to Urgent Care. I explain the situation with the provider there, he looks at the tattoo area and then looks at the hives all over my body and says Im having an allergic reaction and he thinks its to the Clindamycin  He said he isnt 100% sure but it would make sense in the timeline of things. He doesnt believe my tattoo is infected anymore and thinks all the redness I have now is because of the medication allergy and my violent itching of the area (which he absolutely told me to stop). \n\n\nI got a steroid shot in my hip (the most painful thing ever), and get sent off with a Prednisone prescription. Its now 2:30 AM on the 2nd and I have a 6/10 headache preventing me from sleeping and a whole bunch of nausea. My lower leg and thighs are also so itchy. Im not supposed to take the Prednisone until around 9-10 am because I still have the steroid injection in my system. \n\nI am so frustrated with this entire situation and just want it all over with. I work in body care and Im so self conscious of walking into work tomorrow covered in rashes, along with feeling like garbage. I cant soak to help the rashes because of the tattoo healing. They said go back in 3 days if theres no improvement but I will go to the ER at that point instead and hopefully get hooked up to something stronger. \n\nHas anyone had success with Prednisone for skin eruptions from antibiotic allergies? Is it normal for me to have such a bad headache and nausea at this point after a steroid injection or are they unrelated?'"

Can either be one or both cheeks, sometimes the tip of my nose, as well.\n\nDuration: It comes and goes and I\'ve had a hard time pinpointing any real triggers. I first started noticing this about 4-5 years ago. I\'m on blood pressure medication (Lisinopril/HCTZ), but I started taking those two years after I first noticed this problem, and I didn\'t see an increase after starting them, so I don\'t think they\'re related.\n\nSymptoms: Small red bumps that never form whiteheads. My skin is generally chronically light pink, so I\'ve always assumed it was rosacea. I don\'t always have the little bumps, which I refer to as ""flareups,"" but when I do get them, they can be really itchy. If I\'m bad and scratch at them, they can bleed, and they hurt like crazy. The skin is also very warm to the touch, almost like a sunburn.\n\nI\'ve included a link with two photos -- sorry for potato quality. Happy to answer any questions.

concerta,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/13eru4i/improving_my_sleep_a_personal_journey/,b'Improving My Sleep: A Personal Journey',,"b'Hello everyone. Ive gone from averaging 4-6 hours a night to 6-8 on most nights. Heres my story and I hope it brings you hope.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My situation**\n\nI am a male in my mid-twenties, and I have struggled with sleep-maintenance and sleep-onset insomnia since I was 10 years old. This means that I often had difficulty both falling asleep and staying asleep. Although there were occasional days when I slept well, I would say that 75% of the time, I woke up feeling unsatisfied with the level of rest I had achieved. I averaged maybe 5-6 hours of sleep, dipping to 3-4 on bad nights when my body needs 7-8. I felt like I was constantly operating at 50% efficiency and over time, this struggle led me to feel as though I was slipping into a pit of despair with no way out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What didnt work**\n\n* Most conventional sleep hygiene and CBT advice\n* Most of the recommendations in Matt Walker\'s book, ""Why We Sleep""\n* Depression/ anxiety medication, including amitripyline and pregabalin\n* ADHD medication, including Medikinet, Ritalin, and Concerta (though I find them invaluable)\n* Supplements, including magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D\n* Various dietary changes, such as carnivore, keto, and vegan diets\\* Watching the sunset (I read somewhere this might help)\n* Exposing myself to early morning light\n* Adjusting my water intake throughout the day\n* Exercise, including weightlifting and running\n* CBD oil\n* Cutting out PMO\n* Dopamine detoxing\n* Acupressure and massages\n* Sleep restriction\n* And many more\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere were weeks when I felt as though both my body and mind were gradually deteriorating, and I was powerless to stop it. It was incredibly frustrating to try so many techniques, only to have them repeatedly fail. Even more maddening was when a strategy would work for a week, only to lose its effectivenessalmost like a placebo effect that wore off each time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**First breakthrough**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy first breakthrough came when I learned about Daniel Erichsen through this subreddit. He is a sleep doctor who is, radically, not out of touch. One of the main takeaways from his videos was the idea that we should not fear being awake, and that sleep is simply the absence of wakefulness. It was refreshing to hear a sleep professional who did not emphasize the mission-critical importance of sleep, approached the matter with compassion, had a deep understanding that people experience genuine unresolvable distress, and that typical CBT advice can be damaging. His suggestions, delivered in an empathetic and informed manner, echoed the frustrating adage that we should ""stop worrying so much about sleep in order to sleep better""  but in a way that didnt feel derisive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom Dr. Erichsen\'s guidance, I learned that regardless of how well I actually slept at night, I should embrace being awake and, at the very least, be comfortable in my bed. This meant shifting my focus away from all the things I could be doing better to sleep and instead concentrating on enjoying my time awake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEmbracing this new mentality was easier said than done, so I took steps to adopt it. I consciously stopped being overly critical of myself for any perceived shortcomings. Whenever I found myself in a negative headspace, I would verbally express my feelings, engaging in a constructive dialogue with myself that involved negotiating, apologizing, and forgiveness, much like talk therapy. While my sleep quality was still poor, I felt less miserable, which was a huge win.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Second Breakthrough**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith some of the pressure alleviated, I began to view bedtime and sleep as experiences to be grateful for and enjoy. From this refreshed and playful perspective, I committed to trying new strategies without the ""all-or-nothing"" or ""I need this to change my life"" approach. If a new strategy didn\'t work, it was no big deal; if it led to a 5% improvement in any metric, I would be grateful for the incremental progress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI discovered that my sleep maintenance insomnia primarily stemmed from being a light sleeper, as even the slightest disturbances could jolt me awake. This meant that during the light sleep phase, after completing the deep REM stage, I was particularly susceptible to waking up. Consequently, I realized that increasing my comfort in bed was crucial. The idea was so astonishingly banal, yet it revolutionized my sleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Factors Affecting My Comfort:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* The bed I sleep on\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI first noticed this when I visited my family in Disney Florida and slept on a creaky pull-out mattress, which resulted in abysmal sleep for 5 days straight. The following week, while in Washington with my partner, we slept on the largest, thickest Serta mattress I had ever encountered. Both of us slept soundly for over 8 hours for 3 nights in a row, even on a day when I had to wake up at 5 am to catch a bus. This was mind-blowing for me. The stark contrast between my sleep experiences forced me to consider investing in a better bed setup. I had always assumed that bed quality only mattered for those without insomnia, thinking it simply enhanced already-good sleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter several stressful months, I shipped a Winkbed mattress from the US to my home on the other side of the globe, along with other bedding products such as sheets, mattress covers, and pillows. I DIYed a new bedframe and repainted my room. I quickly became an expert in bedding material, temperature regulation, and spinal support. It was an expensive and time-consuming leap of faith (since I couldn\'t return the items), but I maintained the mindset of ""if it fails, it\'s okay; at least I have a comfortable bed and I tried.""\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand that upgrading your bed can be extremely cost-prohibitive and may not be feasible for everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main point is that my increased comfort was primarily due to the improved bed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Miscellaneous factors\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver the following months, as my sleep gradually improved on the new bed, I started noticing small things that detracted from my comfort. I bought a device to control my air conditioning unit remotely, ensuring that my room and bed were cool before bedtime. I acquired a cooling pack for headaches, which I would sometimes wake up with. I began using my mouthguard again to alleviate morning jaw tightness and relied on Avamys nasal spray when I woke up with a dry mouth, indicating that I wasn\'t breathing through my nose during the night. I avoided snacking late at night because I would wake up with an uncomfortable gut. I changed all my sheets to percale cotton and now I never sweat in bed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point is, I began addressing each minor discomfort one by one. While I can\'t say for certain that any individual change improved my sleep, the cumulative effect transformed my relationship with my bed and sleep. I now love lying down on it, rolling around upon waking up, and going to bed. Eventually, not only did my sleep maintenance insomnia improve, but so did my sleep-onset, and I found myself sleeping faster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand that some of this may seem very *Woooo*, but as someone who is highly analytical and critical of anything that sounds remotely pseudoscientific, simply being kinder to myself and focusing on my comfort and pleasure in bed has been transformative. Its absolutely bizarre that such plain concepts were effective. It\'s worth noting that I emerged from a long period of depression about a year beforehand, which likely contributes to my ability to see things from the perspective that I currently do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still experience sleep issues every few nights, sometimes consecutively. However, I can now reliably return to getting restful sleep. While I continue to face health challenges, such as IBS and SIBO, they are much easier to manage with a refreshed mind and body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you find some value in my experiences. The main takeaway is that even if nothing seems to improve your sleep, there are ways to mitigate the pain and despair it can cause.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo close up, Id like to share a poem that served as a lifeline during some of my darkest moments:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Hope is the thing with feathers -*\n\n*That perches in the soul -*\n\n*And sings the tune without the words -*\n\n*And never stops - at all -*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -*\n\n*And sore must be the storm -*\n\n*That could abash the little Bird*\n\n*That kept so many warm -*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Ive heard it in the chillest land -*\n\n*And on the strangest Sea -*\n\n*Yet - never - in Extremity,*\n\n*It asked a crumb - of me.*\n\n*- Emily Dickinson*'"

What if I do 10mg celexa AND 25mg zoloft? I know it wont cause any serotonin issue. First, theyre both pretty low doses and also, Ive adjusted to them.\n\nI did also consider to just add an anti-anxiety pill, but I liked the little natural anxiety I could still feel with Celexa.\n\n\nWhat do you guys think?

To treat it, I have a prescription for oxycodone for when I have a flare-up of cramps and violent pain. It's awful, but my doctor won't sign off on a hysterectomy (where they remove your uterus) until I have exploratory surgery to confirm the diagnosis. I happen to be scared shitless of syringes and invasive medical procedures. \n\nAs a stopgap, I take oxycodone. I like oxycodone, although I use it very sparingly for bad pain only because I'm scared of addiction. The oxycodone makes me feel happy and... normal, I guess. It makes my world feel brighter, and like I can handle things much more easily. I can do things like call family members and talk for a while, make dinner, do chores (when I'm not tipping over), and feel straight-up more outgoing.\n\nHowever, due to the fact that I also have bipolar disorder, oxycodone can throw me into a fit of mania. My mania is never bad in terms of what it makes me do (for the most part, I'll do stuff I've been too depressed or anxious to do), but I tend to crash hard. If I get too manic, I'll work myself up into a flap without thinking and suddenly find myself shaking, wide-eyed, and nauseous as fuck. My panic attacks make me vomit.\n\nAs much as I like oxycodone, I don't feel good right now. I'm panicking and all I can really do is vent to you guys while Mythbusters plays in the background.

He's my safe person and one of the only people I would let call me while I'm having a panic attack. He's my soulmate and means the absolute universe to me, and I miss him so much I feel heartsick. My health has been declining because of it - I'm nauseous every day, lethargic, anxious, have almost no appetite, and generally feel like I'm withering away. The stress of being unable to speak to him is destroying my health.\n\nHe's supposed to get his network set up today, so I'm anxiously (hurr) waiting for any signs of him.

ambien,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/vc8b90/flonase_side_effects/,b'Flonase side effects',,"b'I\'m hoping this can either help someone or give me some answers of what could be going on. This is a very simplified version of a complex situation I\'ve been experiencing. I was using Afrin and Flonase (corticosteroid) nose spray for months. Within that time, I started getting really bizarre and severe symptoms including: \n\nNumbness in parts of my body, pins and needles, ear pressure, internal tremors (it felt like my body was bobbing or swaying on a boat when I was laying), adrenalin surges all night causing insomnia, fainting, vertigo, odd heavy sedated feeling in my limbs, chest tightness, shortness of breath, derealization, heart palpitations, brain fog, suicidal ideation, severe panic attacks different then ones I\'ve ever experienced. They were so primitive, I would wake up and feel like I was in actual danger and felt like I needed to get out of my house. I ended up going to the ER on 3 separate occasions and went to 6 doctors/specialist in this time. I was convinced I had an autoimmune disease or MS that wasn\'t being diagnosed. The insomnia got so bad I went into psychosis and had derealization so bad I truly felt like I lost my mind. I\'ve dealt with anxiety for years and have a pretty good grip on how to calm my nervous system but this felt out of my hands. No matter how calm I got my mind, my body was not adjusting and was in a constant state of fight or flight. I knew something was off in my body. \n\nI made the connection when I used Flonase one night and my lips went numb. I looked online and found thousands of people sharing the same symptoms. You can find some here: [https://www.askapatient.com/viewrating.asp?drug=20121&name=FLONASE](https://www.askapatient.com/viewrating.asp?drug=20121&name=FLONASE)\n\nI also found these two articles on another Reddit post sharing two stories of side effects from oxymetazoline (Afrin) - \n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/22/health/a-wedding-a-cold-and-a-trip-to-the-emergency-room.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/22/health/a-wedding-a-cold-and-a-trip-to-the-emergency-room.html) \n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1486156/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1486156/) \n\nI stopped using both and went through a crazy withdrawal period for about a week. I was having tremors and night sweats, severe vertigo, sharp random pains, throwing up, brain zaps, vibrations all over my body, painful pressure in my hands and feet. I was getting 2 hours of sleep per night and would be in agonizing pain physically and mentally. It seemed like some of the same side effects people experience with discontinuation of benzos or SSRIs. I could barley do anything for months at this point from being so tired. \n\nThe doctors had little answers and kept saying it was neurological but they didn\'t know what it was. During this ordeal, I had the following test done: Holter monitor, MRI, EKG, EEG, Covid antibody, Lyme, autoimmune disease, hormone levels. I\'ve been prescribed 2 antidepressants, migraine medication, and Ambien (I didn\'t use any of them). One doctor told me I was hallucinating it all because I was sleep deprived. I thankfully found one doctor who confirmed that these symptoms could be due to the nose sprays but didn\'t have much of a solution. \n\nHaving to be my own advocate throughout this process, I\'ve dived pretty deep into what could be causing some of my symptoms. Since corticosteroid is a synthetic cortisol, I believe my hormones have been affected.  I\'ve read that excess cortisol can give you symptoms like pins and needles, numbness, muscle weakness. During this time, I also came off birth control. I was off it for a few months before starting the nose sprays but I was starting to experience weird, mild sensations before starting both Afrin and Flonase. After talking to a holistic doctor, I realized that my hormones were never tested properly (needs to be certain days of your cycle for an accurate blood test). She also said it sounded like Lyme which can often come back false negative. Even though my hormone test came back normal, I believe getting off birth control and adding in a steroid threw my hormones off. I also know that both sprays messed my sinus up so bad which I think have been causing ear and head pressure, vibration in my head, and brain fog. I also understand the impact of my nervous system being in a sympathetic state for so long and what that can do to my mind and body. \n\nI stopped 3 months ago and I now have good and bad days. I will go a week or two feeling 80% better but then it will hit again. I talked to a functional medicine practitioner who mentioned withdrawal can happen in ""windows and waves"". Your windows are your good days and your waves are the bad. In time, the waves will become shorter. I exercise regularly, practice yoga and meditation, and eat healthy. It\'s been terrifying to experience what a simple medication can do.\n\nI guess what I\'m curious about is if my body will adjust over time or did something like hormones or nerves get affected by all of this and I need to be looking into something else?  I\'m interested to get to the root cause of what might have happened rather than just take more medications.'"

This September I stated another round. It was planned and showed as needed as my skin started getting worse at the end of the summer (about 3 months off accutane).\n\nLast year I experienced a bunch of symptoms and my health anxiety was going crazy with each of them. I was convinced I had leukemia because my capillaries became more fragile and I'd get petechiae on my legs. But WBC came back totally okay. Then I thought I had Crohn's disease or something like that due to my GIT issues. Or even colon cancer. I struggled with everything from GERD symptoms to bloating, gas, constipation and hard stool which would cause fresh blood on the toilet paper (sorry for the tmi). Had abdominal x-ray done which came back fine as well as the Helicobacter pylori test which was negative. Some of my lymphnodes became painful and my doctor sent me to a full abdominal and cervical USG and also USG of all major lymphnodes. Everything seemed okay apart from some enlargement of a few nodes in my armpits probably from shaving. But my spleen, liver, gall bladder, kidneys, thyroid,... all looked normal. Also the skin wasn't thickened or anything. Later I thought I had multiple sclerosis or even ALS because of paresthesias and pins and needles in my extremities. But brain MRI came back clean. Then I convinced myself I had scleroderma (a rare autoimmune disease) because of my dry and peeling fingers, the petechiae and the GIT problems. I still struggle to leave this one and will probably keep worrying until I see a rheumatologist in late November. \n\nI also suffered from headaches, my teeth were significantly more sensitive and would just randomly ache for no reason, and don't get me started on hair about which I made a full another post. I got random body pains, mostly in legs, my muscles and tendons seemed super tight to the point where I struggled to do any exercise at all. Sometimes my vision got blurry and I also started wearing glasses so try and sort out the vision and headache problems. Might have helped a bit but not much.\n\nIn the summer it was either a tiny bit better or I might just remember it like that because I was less stressed. Hard to tell. But to be honest, I didn't have the best summer ever mentally. So idk. I think at least the GIT problems wouldn't present much throughout the summer. I know for sure that I'd drink iced coffee almost daily which now I can't. I only have it (in a hot form) if I have to so I can study and it upsets my stomach. But tbh it doesn't matter what I put in. Even water is uncomfortable. The neurological stuff never went away but my neurologist thinks it's all anxiety related.\n\nNow as I started the treatment again, I'm getting the craziest flashbacks. All the symptoms are coming back. The teeth are getting painful, the fingers are becoming dry, the stomach is always upset,...\n\nI'm not sure about the petechie because I kind if feel like they went down a notch recently. Which I'm glad for since at least I'm not obsessing over leukemia atm.\n\nAs I'm writing this, it already seems to me that I probably shouldn't be thinking of such diagnosis while most of my symptoms are easily explainable by the meds that I'm taking (apart from accutane it's tianeptine (antidepressant) and keppra (antiepileptic)). But still it would help me relax a bit knowing that others maybe struggle with the same symptoms and don't obsess about them like me because they only see them as side effects of their treatment. Or someone who did struggle with them and is now free of them after finishing the treatment.\n\nAny similar experiences? Or maybe tips on how to manage? The GERD is the worst rn.\n\nThanks in advance! Also thanks if you've read this far. It means a lot."""

I have a bag of 30 yew seeds on my desk I bought nearly a year ago. I was simply setting things up for myself in case I ever got to a point that I ever wanted to give up on life again because I swore I'd never go back into an in-patient mental health facility. The last one made me want to kill myself and I just refuse to be in another one. I know they want to help but they made me 100% worse and my social anxiety increased several times what it was before. This is relevant because I have been having medical issues that have left me with difficulties walking around, my knees trying to give out on me and then we have a bunch of symptoms like lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and disorientation that were all reduced down to, if I had to approximate 3% of what they were after I stopped taking keppra following a set of seizures I had at work about 2 weeks ago. First seizures I have ever had and I didn't feel them coming on besides having extreme dizziness and lightheadedness before the keppra. Anyways, when I was still barely able to even walk across my tiny apartment without nearly falling down I was considering going through with killing myself to the point I dug the seeds out of the box they were in. The idea is still there strongly because I am worried about my quality of life going forward but between the two options I honestly have social anxiety that's crippling and been giving me panic attacks but every time I've been to work since I got back from a vacation my health is getting worse and I believe it's stress setting me off. \n\nAnyways, that aside. I am considering cutting myself off from my plan to use yew seeds to kill myself by taking them in to my doctor's appointment tomorrow and telling them how I have been feeling and turning over the seeds so I both no longer have access but if I get more it'll be in a chart someplace so it'll be harder to carry through with, though the whole idea of using the seeds was to take twice the normal dose and waiting an hour before going in so it won't, in theory, be reversible. I am worried that doing it will land me in an in-patient facility and there's a part of me that's afraid of giving up my plan because it's the least messy and harmful to others I could think up. \n\nI know the obvious answer is man up and go turn in the seeds and tell the truth but I am really worried about doing it.

On days where it isnt urgent, its still very loose.\n\nMedical History: \n- Diagnosed with diabetes in July 2020 due to bloods showing HBA1C of 102 (mmol/mol)\n- Started on Metformin while in hospital following diagnosis to check for ketoacidosis (negative).\n- High blood pressure & tachichardia found at follow-on appointment - started on atenolol and ramapril.\n- Searching for cause of such a sudden onset of diabetes (no prior medical issues before this), took private ultrasound. Showed enlarged spleen - dismissed / never really followed up by GP.\n- Three months before all this had started jogging and healthy eating (the irony).\n- Came off atenolol in October 2020 due to constipation and diarrhea (4+1 day cycle) \n- Canagliflozen added to metformin to help diabetes management - HBA1C reached 50, constipation eased and normal bowel movements resumed briefly (4-6 weeks).\n- Chronic Diarrhea starts - first remembered episode Christmas Eve 2020.\n- Metformin removed and sitagliptin added in March 2021 to rule out Metformin causing Diarrhea.\n- Faecal haemoglobin test borderline in March 2021 - referred for colonoscopy on red route (cancer screen) - negative and no abnormalities  on biopsies\n- Found evidence of relief in high dose of Immodium from pharmacy - prescribed this (loperamide) to try in July while waiting for gastroenterologist referral (Dec 2021) with GI consultants consent to my GP.\n- Found some relief at max dose of loperamide timed correctly (on waking & 30 mins before evening meal).\n- Stools remained loose and occasionally urgent - watery/gushing, but 1-2 episodes lasting 1-3 movements per week.\n- Due to length of issue and overnight faecal incontinence, GP chased gastro to see if any further preliminary consultations could be ordered\n- Prescribed low dose amitriptyline to attempt to help avoid overnight faecal incontinence \n- Sehcat test ordered - positive result - <2% of radioactive tracer remaining after 7 days.\n- Gastro consultant appointment (at last) 23rd Dec 2021 - phone call with only available follow up Oct 2022 (!!) but results of sehcat given suspected diagnosis of bile acid diarrhea with caveat that sehcat result can be swayed by other forms of diarrhea.\n- Started on Cholostyramine Light (4g)\n- Increased dose to max prescribed (3x daily) and dropped off loperamide gradually (3 weeks).\n- Now experiencing daily chronic diarrhea episodes again, these have been getting worse as I slowed loperamide intake.\n\n- Sidebar: Between July - November 2020 had growing  burning pain on top of feet (mainly right)\n- Suspected diagnosis of Diabetic Foot Neuropathy, started on naproxen (no relief), then cocodamol (some minor relief), then pregabalin (showed more relief). Increased dose of 2x 225mg pregabalin controlled foot pain\n\nReally hope someone can help.

Before I wasn't cleaning myself properly in the shower, I would put on dirty clothes and not realize it until I was in public.  The list goes on and on.

I was really in bad shape and wasn't leaving the bed for 3-4 years prior.  Hemp flower is also helping now that it's legal.  (see r/cbd or r/hempflowers)  Also in the near future: CBG is looking good for social anxiety.  [THCV is a good anti-psychotic/anti-depressant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4337703/), and CBN will be for sleep.

NAC I can tell I've taken it within 15 minutes.  I also take L-tyrosine which is fantastic for morning energy.  The CBD oil balances it quite well.  My OCD tendencies are also way down.  I'm less irritable.  People aren't driving me crazy to the point I stay in isolation as much.\n\nNAC and CBD oil both help stop a feeling like I'm not OK.  I wonder if many people who have addictions are trying to bandaid this feeling.  I no longer fear going back to alcohol to cover up that feeling.  It wasn't even so much an addiction for me, there was something wrong 24/7 since birth in my mind, and I was drinking coffee all day to try and stop it at 15, then found alcohol and used that in small amounts almost daily just to go to class (then tolerance grew....)  r/supplements is a good sub to browse, just don't get obsessed with supplements where you buy 10 different ones at the same time.  You can get a few basic vitamins, but only try one new amino acid or herb at a time.\n\nNutrition/Vitamins\n\nMost people are deficient in Magnesium, many in D3 (always take K2 with D3).  Probiotics are great, if our gut health is bad, it will affect our nervous system and mindset.  Psyllium husk is a fantastic fiber that will save you a fortune on toilet paper.  Also an omega 3.  L-theanine can be helpful for calming like the magnesium.  Add all that to the NAC and possibly CBD oil, and for me that was enough to get off all the synthetic prescriptions and start to feel like a halfway functional human being.  Apple Cider Vinegar I also take, 20ml or so mixed in some water so it doesn't irritate my throat.  It's stopped the heartburn where I could get off the prilosec completely.  I cut out most sugars, fast foods, processed foods.  I eat a lot of grass fed beef now.  The amino acids in good quality beef make me feel so much better.  I believe amino acid supplementation will be a growing trend, they have noticeable affects.\n\nExercise, Getting Outside, Sunlight\n\nHuman beings were made to feel sunlight, the wind in their face, to appreciate beauty.  For me a lot of this came 6 months + after I got the supplements right and started exercising alone in my room (push-ups, kettlebells, etc...).  Just do all you can to sit or walk outside, become aware of the beauty that's all around you that you got so used to you have forgotten.  Someone who has been in prison 10 years would do a lot to appreciate that beauty.  Sunlight also helps a lot in small amounts.  A gentle breeze does something to the soul.  We are in real time and have no idea what could happen at any moment, and it won't last like this forever.  Baby steps are what it often takes, bargain with yourself.  See what you are willing to get yourself to do.  Even if that's 1 minute outside at a time, or walking 20 feet and back to check the mail.  Keep track of your progress.  Sometimes there's helpful techniques at r/GetMotivated or r/getdisciplined\n\nThe Psalms are also a balm to my soul and emotional equalizer.\n\nThose are a few things that have helped me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;"""

influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/6xzjut/pertussis/,b'Pertussis',,"b'Art lesson today. My teacher said if someone gets thinking of a topic for a while then there is probably a reason. So I told her ""I\'ve been thinking recently about steampunk and whooping cough"". And she asked ""why whooping cough"" and I was ""that is what I am asking you."" I figured out the reason, Anti vaccination. About a month ago I searched for pertussis videos and it is a horrible, disgusting disease. I wouldn\'t wish it on my worst enemy. It isn\'t as bad as polio out of the vaccinatable diseases. But it is IMO the most disgusting of the disease that are vaccinated against. Your lungs fill with a sticky fluid until you either drown or get a cough so bad you are left gasping for air which isn\'t received well by your mucus covered lungs.

Dentist said it needed a filling and a crown, but not a root canal. Tooth didn\'t hurt much but had some sensitivity. I generally trust my dentist, said ok, lets do this.\n\nThe crown appointment was rough. They had to give me three or four shots, and still didn\'t get me fully numb. Mouth, lips, and tongue were numb, but not the tooth fully. I could feel it when they drilled down really deep. Fortunately, the part I could feel was at the very end, and they finished, installed the temporary crown and sent me home.\n\nAs soon as the numbing wore off, I was in PAIN. Aching pain within the tooth that over the counter pain relievers helped with, but it always came back, and got worse as time went on. Waited about a week, when it started waking me up in my sleep, which the dentist had said to watch for, and then called my dentist. They had me come in that day and did some tests and a bite adjustment. Sanded the tooth down really far because they kept having me bite on a bite stick and if I said it hurt, they took more off. It always hurt.\n\nThe pain didn\'t go away, and continued to worsen. Called several days later, and the dentist said to give it more time, and if I ""couldn\'t take it"" by the time the appointment for the crown installment, they could do a root canal instead. \n\nThe pain continued to worsen, and at my appointment I was given the option of putting on the permanent crown and waiting the pain out, or having the root canal. I opted for the root canal.\n\nThey again couldn\'t get me numb in that specific tooth for the root canal, despite giving me four or five shots (I lost count) at different points in the procedure when I said I felt pain, and in the end the problem nerve was still ""live"" when they pulled it out. They had to take breaks for me to cry and shake because I was in so much pain, and the initial shots were also excruciating. I asked for gas to take the edge off, but they didn\'t offer that. Once they got the problem nerve out it was fine, but it was an ordeal to get to that point. I was very sore for... three or four days after that, but it has gone better as time has gone on.\n\nI have my second root canal appointment next week, and I am dreading it, even though the problem nerve is now gone. My understanding is that they need to make sure the tooth is clean, fill it, and attach the permanent crown. Is this going to hurt? Can I trust my dentist to finish this properly? Should I get the crown and take it to some other dentist to finish it, someone who can give me gas or something else to help with the pain, or numb the tooth properly?\n\n(I do not drink, smoke, or do recreational drugs, and I can\'t take NSAIDs for more than a couple days at a time without it giving me horrible heartburn due to previous stomach issues. The amount I had to take during this time did give me horrible heartburn and I have been sparing with the ibuprofen/naproxen past the first couple of days after each appointment, when I would switch to acetominophen only)'"

Dental student here, just wanting to share a friendly PSA about your meds and oral health!""",,"b""The problem: Pretty much all of the meds prescribed for ADHD cause xerostomia (dry mouth). This includes all stimulants, and intuniv. Dry mouth is a huge factor in getting tooth decay and gum disease. You saliva naturally has antimicrobial components (like dozens of types) which reduce the bad bacteria. In someone with chronic dry mouth, bacteria accumulates on the gumline, not on the occlusal/top of the tooth like you normally think of. Even with regular brushing twice a day, you can still get cavities. \n\nYour options:\n\n1. Get a professional cleaning and evaluation every 4-6 months (more frequent than people who aren't as high risk. These are official guidelines for anyone taking these meds). It's expensive now, but when you're risking paying for $2000-3000 to replace a single tooth, it's a really good investment. \n2. Dry mouth options: Biotene mouthwash is fantastic. Use that several times a day. Also Xylimelts by OroCoat is a tablet that goes on your cheek and helps day and night. I personally love these, especially at night. Gum with xylitol is also good. \n3. Make sure you're brushing properly, especially for you guys. Your brush should be at a 45 degree angle and using a soft brush, make sure you get the gum line. The idea is to clean in the little pocket between your gum and your teeth. This is where the bacteria proliferates in dry mouth\n4. Use toothpaste with lots of fluoride. Sensodyne is my recommended brand. You can also get prescription toothpaste with even more fluoride. You can also get prescription fluoride rinses. Additionally, your dentist can give you MI Paste/recaldent which you just brush on at night and don't spit out. It reverses small lesions on your tooth that haven't had enamel break off. \n\nIt sucks that we have this challenge, but this is really important to save you money down the road. Dentistry is insanely expensive if you have wide-spread cavities. The office should send out reminder cards to make appoints, so that's some pressure off of you! \n\nIf you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them!\n\nTL;DR: If you're taking ADHD meds, you need to take extra steps (above) to prevent you from paying tons of money in dental work later because you're at a high risk for cavities."""

Bruises seem to randomly appear mainly on my forearm and I usually only notice when Im wearing short sleeves and looking in the mirror when brushing my teeth. Occasionally Ill get one on top of one of my hands, on top of my foot, or inner thigh. Im never covered in them, its typically one or two at a time and I can go ages and not notice any. Im definitely not banging into anything prior to them appearing. Im not even sure if bruise is the right way to describe them. Theyre more brown or reddish brown than black and blue. Not tender at all. Ive had bloodwork done and dont recall everything that was checked but my doc ruled out clotting disorders. Typically my bloodwork is normal except for slightly low lymphocytes which is an expected side effect of Ocrevus. Same when on previous tx Gilenya. Onset of bruising was prior to Ocrevus and I cant recall if it started before or after starting Gilenya. \nMy iron and ferritin tends to dip a bit so I do take Ferrasorb to stay in the normal range. Ive had no bleeding issues eg gums, and if I get a cut I heal quickly. \nNot sure if related but In 2016 I had my first episode of a lacy rash on my arms which comes and goes. No cause for this was ever determined. \n\nFamily history of breast cancer, lung cancer, CV disease, Type 2 diabetes. My mother did have ITP around age 65, which resolved with treatment. Her marks looked different than mine.\nIve had no unintentional weight loss, in fact Ive gained 5 kg or so in the past two years from excess calorie consumption. \nNo fever or night sweats. \nNo history of hot flashes. \nRarely drink alcohol and have never smoked. No recreational drug use.\nNo fatigue that is out of the ordinary for me due to having multiple sclerosis.\nI take some other various supplements on and off eg: Omega 3, CoQ10, magnesium, multivit, vitamin C, collagen powder, Im not that disciplined with them, but in any event it seems this issue has nothing to do with them as the bruising occurs whether or not I take them. \nAny insights/suggestions would be appreciated! Its not bothersome other than a nagging concern that something insidious might be going on. Could it be due to my treatment-induced low lymphocyte count and if so, are there longer term complications I should be concerned about? \nFor some reason Im unable to post images of the bruises.'"

This is a long post and I know your guys have precious little time and have to deal with your own demons so I appreciate your time\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood day all you lovely people . I just wanted to share my findings and maybe give some insight on what it feels like if somebody should think about getting a diagnoses or contemplating using it.\n\nThis is just a disclaimer and I am not a doctor by any way, shape or form and totally anecdotal so please take everything with a grain of salt.\n\nI have been given both Concerta and Ritalin to test with and see what works best.  here is just as a brief history .  I have been diagnosed with depression in the past but stopped using my Wellbutrin medication for various reasons , biggest being I could not cope with the ""zombie"" state and I felt my Psychiatrist miss diagnosed me. I had depression but I think it was because of my AHAD and not my ""inherent"" depression. You kind of feel like a loser when you are in school and can\'t concentrate for shit and everybody makes you feel like a dumb ass. Eventually you lose interest because you feel , what is the point  you just going to fail , right ? I spoke quicker than I was thinking and that made me look even dumber and the same thing happened when I when I had to write something down. I see the words but I don\'t understand them and cant remember anything\n\nLuckily, I was not completely stupid even only going to school for 2 days a week , the rest of the week I  slipped out and stayed at a friends house even when I was at school I would disruptive and tried to get chased out of class.  My life was a living hell but I was able to graduate . Went to study IT after school and graduated by the skin of my ass\n\nForward to now ,I have to study something else because my field is a sink hole and I need to upskill, change my field or do something completely different .  I know exactly what I need to do but concentrating for more than 2 minutes is torture . That is what prompted me to get another diagnoses because I never though I had this ADD issue. Just though it was depression. So officially I started last week and these are my findings.\n\nI don\'t even know how to put this into words but I will try... I can concentrate for the first time in my life . Not only is my mind focused I actually care about things that I found boring or could not read  because my attention would fail .  For the first time in my life I feel optimism .   this is a strange feeling because I am not used to it.  For the first time I feel hope.\n\nMaybe it will be short lived , this is only the first week but I can feel it and no its not the placebo affect . I know what it feels like to be on anti depressants and what it did to my mind. This is different .\n\nI think one of life\'s biggest issues are that we feel that we are not living up to our potential , nothing worse than wasting ones time and talents and yes we all have a talent . Something you would think is stupid for you but completely out of reach for somebody else. I like talking  , a lot  , maybe its my ADHD but still . I know you guys think its stupid but some people cant do it at all .  I will try to be the best me ,  I just want to feel I gave it my all . win or lose .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIF anybody should be interested ,  I will be leaving a ""diary"" of sorts on this forum if anybody wants to see the affects .  Like I said this is anecdotal and everybody is different but I always say that more information is better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wish for all you lovely people are just being content.  I hope you succeed in that journey and sorry for this long ass post .  Whoever reads this you have my thanks and I sincerely appreciate it.'"

keppra,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/qgn3o3/fyi_on_antidepressants/,b'FYI on antidepressants',,"b'I\'ve noticed an awful lot of misinformation on this subreddit on antidepressants, including ""antidepressants can be addictive"" and ""antidepressants won\'t give you withdrawals when you stop taking them.""\n\nBoth of these things are absolutely incorrect. Someone who takes Zoloft (or any other non-addictive medication) every day, is dependent. This means that their body is used to getting this medication daily. When you lower your dose, or stop taking it all together, you will likely experience minor withdrawals (a lot of people do, but they\'re generally pretty minor). Withdrawals do not indicate that you are addicted to a medication. \n\nYou can be dependent without being addicted, and a lot of people are. Granny taking Lortab for her cancer pain is probably dependent, but probably not addicted. Billy, who takes Keppra for his epilepsy, is dependent, but is certainly not addicted. Addiction is marked by the continuous use of a substance (or anything, really, like gambling), in spite of the negative effects it has on your work, family, social life, health, etc, and that you will put this substance first before other needs (like not paying your bills so you can buy more meth, for example). Another part of it is that it is difficult to control your use, like you take Oxycodone more often than prescribed, you tend to run out sooner than normal, your use is continously ramping up, etc. A person isn\'t going to have work or social issues because they take Prozac, and they\'re certainly not going to pawn their guitar, consider robbing a pharmacy, steal from someone\'s medication cabinet, or spend all of their rent money to get more Prozac if they run out.\n\nTLDR: **Antidepressants aren\'t addictive.** You will likely become dependent on the medication if you take it for a longer period of time (a month or more), which simply means your body is used to it and **you will likely experience minor withdrawal symptoms when you lower your dose or quit taking it all together**.'"

Into my twenties I started feeling the onset of anxiety/depression. Into my late twenties my lack of follow through in comparison to my ambitions was ever stretching and I typically felt shitty 10 months out of the year. The other two months I felt a little surge of motivation and tried to 'get things done' but typically failed pretty quickly.\n\nAnyway - last year I finally saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me adderall (a drug I became all too familiar with years ago and then stopped using as I was abusing it and it was not helping me get things done). I thought this time would be different because I was married now and my wife could help me stay on track. I'd take the proper dosage and 'get shit done'. Wrong. After a couple months, I felt highly addicted to the ADs and was even snorting it. I was the opposite of productive on it. So I decided it was a failed experiment and prepared to quit.... this is where things get weird.\n\nIn December '17 I stopped taking adderall cold turkey. I was worried about the intense lethargic withdrawls (that I had experienced in the past) and researched supplements to help. I started taking L-Theanine, Magnesium and 5 htp the day I stopped taking adderall. \n\nI never had a 'crash' and I felt great.... too great. I started feeling immense joy and motivation. By day 5 I was literally jumping out of bed. If something was funny I would burst out laughing aggressively and then would internally step back in concern for my behavior. I have never felt this good in my life. It seemed to last 5 months straight. During this time I accomplished so much shit... I literally decided I wanted to become a film maker; I wrote, produced and directed a short film in 3 months (I've never shot a film before unless extra cred in highschool counts). After I wrote the script in 3 days I strategically watched/read copious amounts of info on the workflow of filmmaking, downloaded production templates and started location scouting, set/wardrobe purchasing and budgeting. It's currently being edited. It looks amazing, I attached a raw photo still from the set.... I literally have no fucking clue how it happened..... And now the zeal is gone and I don't feel the same and it's difficult to continue into the next phase of sound design. \n\nHOWEVER, I have not gone back to feeling the same depression/anxiety i've had all of my 20's. My anxiety is still 95% gone compared to how it was and I am now not held back from being productive when I feel like shit. I can still keep my life progressing in spite of not feeling 'happy' all the time. But I'm definitely a far cry from being as motivated and feeling happy how I was the first part of this year.\n\nThe only things I take now are L Theanine, Magnesium L Threonate and fish oil. \n\nI'm a bit nervous about slowly slipping back into depression heavily. It's difficult to not crave that same manic state (was it mania?). The thing is, I never felt out of control. I was the most attentive to my friendships in my life, I was much more available and unfathomably specific with how I used my time. \n\nAnyway, that's my story. All thoughts are welcome. Also, my goal wasn't to brag about making a film - I do think it looks nice - but I think the narrative may suck some major balls and, well, that's sort of the only thing that counts. All I want to do is make movies now. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0p466ybbpig11.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dce7a0e8ad4ea12d33c2644d819718b73729f169"""

Like going to bed early, getting a full 8-9 hours in, I have tried it, but I knew going into it that it would never work. I have had depression for the last 2 years, but I never thought about it or had it diagnosed officially until a month ago. When I was 8 years old, roughly, it was a wednesday morning, 3:30 AM on a school morning when I woke up suddenly. It was abnormal of me to wake up at this hour and I really needed to go to the bathroom. My apartment at the time had 2 bathrooms, one of which was farther from my room, and smaller which i didnt like. for whatever reason, I was drawn to the bathroom I didnt like. I walked in, and there she was. My mom. She had a belt wrapped around her low shoulder/high bicep area, a needle sticking out of her elbow, vomit, just, everywhere im telling you. Her veins were popping a harsh black, thick color and she was ferociously seizing, I was so confused, I had no idea what drugs were, let alone heroin or other insanely hard drugs like that. I thought for sure she was dying, I called 911 just crying, so unfathomably hard, telling them my mom is going to die, and I dont know whats going on, Im alone, now. My mom who I loved so, so much just might leave my life forever, so I thought at the time. She always told me she was ""sick"" and that the heroin scattered amongst the house was medicine. Anyway, the police got to my apartment building, Im up on the third floor and I have to buzz them into the building. **I didn\'t know how.** So, there I was left with A gigantic decision. My mom was dying, do I stay with her with her for her last moments, or do I leave her, alone, in her vomit and blood, to get what might potentially save her life. After about 10 seconds, I put the phone down and I let them in, they rushed upstairs and when I got back she had stopped moving. I was certain she died. We called my grandma (me and a cop) to come pick me up and take me to her house. about 7 hours later I got a call from my mom, she was alive, and unwell. She told me how much she loved me, and how sorry she was, and she **PROMISED** she would make it up to me. I made the stupid decision to believe her. 1 month later she was back, ""healthy"" and out of rehab, but she was still using. Everything was back to normal, as my addict mom and my completely healthy dad battled in court for me, I was kept fully out of the loop, (which I now agree with) I was living back with my mom half the time, just me and her. Then after a month or so, I awoke on another school night. But this time it was different, things were breaking, alarms were ringing, smoke was pouring into my room, My house was on fire. I got up, left my room and looked into my kitchen, the whole thing was in flames, I was coughing up thick black smoke and couldnt see a thing. So, I did what I believed to be the best thing which was to go get my mom, I have to save my mom! right? I sprinted and swung her door open with my eyes watering, screaming, ""MOM! MOM PLEASE GET UP!"" repeatedly, only to soon realize she wasn\'t there. I looked in the bathroom, I looked in the living room, even back in the kitchen. I couldnt find her. So I left, I went downstairs and out the building where everyone else was. I was sobbing, telling everyone my mom burned up, because thats what I truly thought. And then out of no where, like a movie, she appeared in the crowd, and it clicked. She had left me in there, I could have died in there, I looked for so, so long for my mom, whilst the whole time she was actively leaving to burn and die, alone in my room with my cat sweetie. (R.I.P SWEETIE <3) I just couldnt believe it. When I told my dad, it was over, he made the executive decision to ignore the law. He did everything in his power to keep my from my mom under any circumstance. My apartment with mom was inhabitable, so she moved in with the same grandmother that had picked me up that one wednesday morning. And **SOMEHOW** because my dad was breaking the law bound agreement to allow my mother to see me half the time, the court was siding with my mother in what would become a 3 year long custody battle. This whole battle im resenting my father for not allowing me to see my mom after the fire, whilst also being so sad that she left me there to die. But I forgave her quickly as a 8-9 year old boy. This whole battle, my grandma had also been facing a battle that I didnt know about, She would go on to die of lung cancer about a year later, December 23rd 2015. I truly loved her so, so much. Now, due to her death, my mom had no home, she kept using heroin, and was in and out of jail for petty theft charges constantly. My dad had finally won custody over me. Life was sad, but finally I didnt have to deal with all this shit going down all the time. Until I did again, because my grandma was a wealthy woman, she had left me a sum of money on her will for the day I turned 18 years old, which would now be in exactly 1 month and 1 day, this sum was $65,000. But unfortunately, I would find out 2 years ago at the age of 15 that because this will was last updated before my mother would become an addict, she would have the authority to hold this money for me. Im sure you can see where this is going... My mom did not save that money, she used all of it, every penny on heroin and other pointless things that she currently no longer has. It makes me feel so utterly useless. Am I really **THAT** invaluable to my own mother who I loved unconditionally? My dad and I were fighting because he used to never tell me the whole story about my mom, and my man was, well, not being remotely a mom. So I was so, so sad, I was in grade 10, covid was hitting, I couldnt see my friends, My mom was gone, and had ran away with my future education fund, and everything was terrible. Now I am 17, living with the sadness to this day. Every minor inconvenience in my life is detrimental to my mental health. I feel like life is a constant loop of pain, so it isnt worth getting out of bed to experience, I just want to curl up in a ball and lay there in my bed, completely silent, alone. I began cutting myself a week ago. Ever since then it has been calling me. It literally feels as if the razor blade that is currently in eyeshot, speaks to me, tells me that it can help me feel something. My arm is currently riddled with dry blood from the cutting I did moments before deciding I was going to type out this post. (I never use reddit) and university is coming, I got accepted into the UFV which is the cheapest, closest school in British Columbia to me. But I just cant go to school, I used to be a fantastic, lively student with good grades, I now average a 46% only maintaining a 79% in English 12 because I NEED it to graduate, and my dad would be devastated if I didnt graduate and became a failure after all the work he has done to get me to where I am now. I think thats my biggest fear, to fail my father after all he is done for me. I think im done now, I am done typing. If no one reads this, well, atleast I wrote it all down to look back at. But for those who read the whole thing, please give me honest opinions or whatever in the comments, I want to hear what everyone has to say. thank you guys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Marcus | 1:35 AM | 5/26/2023'"

NSAID,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/12a0nxv/nsaids_and_sciatica/,b'NSAIDS and sciatica',,"b'I saw a post the other day asking about the use of NSAIDs and if we were hindering the bodies natural healing responses by reducing inflammation.   I had asked a similar question to my ortho awhile back about steroids and also NSAIDs in there role of helping with bulging or herniated discs.  Thought I would pass along what his take was.  \n\nInflammation is the bodies response to damage and to help bring healing factors to that site, however a disc out of its natural space isnt something that the body can heal in the traditional sense.   The disc material needs back in its space or in case of herniation the leaking material washed away.    In this case inflammation is hindering some of the discs ability to go back into the disc space.  By swelling it continues to protrude into the nerve space and as the nerve is pressed upon it continues sending distress signals causing something similar to a feedback loop.   The inflammation continues which is whats causing pressure on the nerve which is what causes the inflammation.    Steroid injections seek to stop this loop and NSAIDs can sometimes help enough to allow things to calm down for the disc to pull back towards the space it should be in.   He says they like to call it inflammation soup or stew.   Its a situation where the bodies natural responses are working in a way not really intended. Allergic reactions are an immune response but that doesnt mean that its a natural one working in an intended way.'"

I keep living the same day over and over again. \n\nI have to live with parents who aren't the most rational human beings. Over my life I've suffered abuse at their hands even if they meant well. They probably damaged me more than any school bully that I encountered ever could.\n\nI currently have no friends, I lost most of them when I became homeschooled from 8th grade up to high school graduation.\n\nI never went to college after high school. I have no job, no car and no driver's license. I want to make a career out of something creative and enjoyable like animation, drawing and music.\n\nNow, Since around the last quarter of 2021, I've dreamed about reuniting with my old friends. I dreamed for that to happen, I wanted that to happen in 2022. I wanted to see what they could do for me. \n\nBut I got sick with covid-19 at the start of that year, and since my recovery, my parents won't get me vaccinated. I've only faced denial, gaslighting and attempted manipulation against me. \n\nEveryday since then, I have moments of anger and sadness that I have no sense of control of my life. I have unpleasant and unwanted thoughts of suicide and killing my parents, because I feel that they keep getting in the way by not acknowledging the consequences of their actions and behavior. I'm too much of a coward to stand up against them, or even do any kind of harm towards them.\n\nI can only keep myself sane by expressing anger in a room alone, playing video games and listening to music and I've several times read a local newspaper article online about a high school graduation with a list of the names of my friends who have graduated, but all of that almost never takes my mind off of what I'm upset about. All of that is just putting bandages over broken bones, or possibly just makes the pain worse.\n\nI feel that there is little to no hope for change. I feel that I am doomed to live this way forever with no light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nI get advice telling me that I need to take action. I'm told to leave my family's home and leave this town and go back to the place where I had friends. I'm told that I need to call a crisis hotline if my mental situation really is that bad. \n\nBut my level of courage is next to nothing. Calling a simple number is a very scary thing for me. I feel that I would get in trouble with my parents if I called for an ambulance to take me away from there. I feel that after spending time admitted to a mental hospital, I would be sent back to my family back in the same environment that is the source of my mental anguish."""

celebrex,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/rd5oct/mystery_illness_multiple_doctors_and_no_answers/,"b'Mystery Illness, Multiple Doctors and No Answers'",,"b""Hi, \n34yo F, 5'4 185lbs, USA \n\nHISTORY: Diagnosed with pcos as a teen. Required a year of fertility medication to achieve each of my 3 pregnancies. I had to have my gal bladder removed following the birth of my first child 8 years ago. After my third child was born I needed a hysterectomy with an anterior and posterior repair (I still have my ovaries). I did pelvic floor rehab and physical therapy for 5 months.  One year later I had to go in for another anterior and posterior repair with the addition of a mesh sling. After surgery the surgeon said the top layer of my stitches from the previous year had torn apart in a way she'd never seen before.  Following surgery I had internal pelvic pain that did not decrease with time. After 3 months I was given lidocaine shots near the mesh and the pain decreased.  I have pretty bad tmj and boneless in my jaw, as well as arthritis in my neck after an injury in my teens and getting rear ended in my early 20s. I was uncomfortable with the idea of pain medication and tried physical therapy, massage, acupressure, and dry needling. None of this relieved the constant neck pain so I underwent an ablation in my C4 and C5. It helped a bit but not a lot so I underwent a second round of the ablation. Pain still continued. I went through two more rounds of ablation, this time at C3. Pain was decreased but still severe. I then had 2 rounds of ablation on my C2 and had significant improvement. I have a history of migraines which were alleviated with botox in my scalp and temples. In my early 20's I suddenly developed a syncope issue related to too much adrenalin/rapid heart rate. This was successfully treated with a beta blocker until my first pregnancy, over the course of my first trimester the syncope issues gradually decreased and disappeared. \nI take 150mg of effexor for depression and anxiety. Prilosec for reflux and esophagus tightness. 60 mg of Vyvanse for ADHD. 200 mg of celebrex for the arthritis. Zyrtec for mild allergies. \n\n\n1 year ago I had rapid weight gain, 20 pounds in 3 weeks, with no change in diet. I was incredibly fatigued and could not stay awake. I had widespread pain in my joints and limbs and felt very weak. My focus and mental capabilities felt diminished and I had severe mood swings that seemed random and unrelated to my environment and experiences.  Before this started I jogged for 45 min followed by light weight lifting and strength training for 20-30 min 5 days a week. When the symptoms started I was 145lbs and had been slowly losing baby weight over the course of the year. \n\n\nI went to my GP, he said all my labs and blood work looked normal except for saying it showed I possibly had an autoimmune disorder, though he didn't know what kind. \nHe referred me to a rheumatologist. While waiting for my rheumatologist appointment (they could not get me on the schedule for over 3 months) I sought the opinion of another GP.  They also ran many labs and bloodwork which came back normal, except for low vitamin D, and told me to lose weight and prescribed 1 dose of a vitamin D pill per week. They suggested I try keto and intermittent fasting. I cut calories down to 1200 a day and my symptoms and weight gain did not improve. I continued gaining weight, just at a slower rate. At a follow- up appointment they suggested a stricter diet. I switched to a whole food vegan diet and 1000 calories per day and my weight continued to gain and my symptoms did not decrease. Next I tried a 600 calorie per day liquid diet and the weight gain slowed a little more but still continued. \n\n\nAt the rheumatologist appointment he couldn't see anything out of the ordinary and asked why they'd even referred me to his office. He ran more bloodwork and labs and said they all looked normal. \n\n\nAt this point I requested a referral to an endocrinologist. In the months it took to get an appointment I adapted to the symptoms and found a way to still live life with these symptoms because I am not in a position where I can take days off. I went back to a more typical eating plan but cut portion sizes because I felt much worse on the low calorie, vegan, and intermittent fasting eating plans. My weight gain increased with this change, daily calorie intake was between 1400 and 1600. \n\n\nThe endocrinologist tested me for cushings, hashimotos, and well as extensive bloodwork. All the results came back normal. \n\n\nI found another endocrinologist to see if they could find any answers and after many labs and more bloodwork all she found was a slight glucose intolerance (likely due to my pcos which was diagnosed as a teen) and prescribed metformin.  They said my all my thyroid and cortisol levels look good and that this is all from the glucose intolerance and said to follow up in 3 months of metformin. \n\n\nI have noticed a slight increase in my energy levels, fatigue, and mental clarity, but only slightly. My weight is still climbing even though I am eating 1 serving of flaxseed oatmeal for breakfast, 1-2 cups of greens and 3 oz of grilled chicken breast for lunch and dinner. Though I do sometimes have a small piece or two of dark chocolate in the afternoon or evening. \n\n\nI do not feel like myself at all. I feel tired, weak, grumpy, and less intelligent. I typically am a positive and energetic person . My quality of life has significantly declined. \n\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations, advice, ideas, suggestions, etc? Or a suggestion on what specialty branch of medicine I should try? \n\n\nThank you in advance.\nEdited to include labwork. \n\n[labwork](https://imgur.com/a/8iauRbY)"""
plaquenil,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3fsbv5/trying_to_be_there_for_my_fiance_looking_for/,"b'Trying to be there for my Fiance, looking for advice. (Long and detailed, hopefully so i dont miss anything)'",,"b'(throwaway because I said so)\n\nHey everyone,\n\nIve(28M) been with my Fiance(22F)(for ease, we\'ll call her Sara) for almost a year, we got engaged in February and im looking for advice on how to support her. \n\nBackstory: We met online in September 2014 and got engaged in February of this year, and getting married next June. I know its a very short time frame, im not here to get advice about when we should get married or that we havent been together long enough, so please save it. Sara has been diagnosed with Depression for several years, and was able to maintain and continue with her life fairly regularly up until recently. I dont know what medications she has been on for her depression. She had a viral infection in December, and another in January that may have been a relapse of the original. Anyways, she started suffering from Hives all over her body shortly after the viral infection, and was on several forms of antihistamines for several months as prescribed by her Dr, thinking it was some sort of allergic reaction. We saw a dermatologist as well, and they essentially said to try taking meds at different times to see if it would help. By the spring, she was starting to experience some minor swelling in her hands and feet, exhaustion, pain in her joints and lack of sleep due to not feeling well. Around this time, we were talking about children, and she wanted to get her IUD removed so she could go on the pill, which I was fine with. Howeer, shortly after removing her IUD, the symptoms she was experiencing drastically increased, and kids were put on hold until we could figure out what was going on with her body.\n\nWe decided to see a different Dr. per recommendation from my cousin, who is a phlebotomist in this Dr\'s office, the Dr. is an Internist specializing in internal disease and medicine. He quickly diagnosed that she was experiencing an Autoimmune disease and was not having an allergic reaction, and started her on a new regiment of medications after discontinuing the Antihistamines she was on. Early results were okay, she was already on Prednizone to help with her hives, however she started gaining weight due to her dosage and wasn\'t happy with her weight gain. She also was started on Plaquenil, which is an anti-malarial drug that also has shown to help with symptoms of Rhuematoid Arthritis, and Vitamin D3 to help with her low energy and vitamin D count. However, the plaquenil over the last month or two has really taken a toll on her digestive system, giving her upset stomachs every morning along with diarhea multiple times daily. We had another meeting with her new Dr a couple weeks ago, and he discontinued her Plaquenil and started her on Methotrexate instead. Her stomach problems haven\'t been as bad since getting her off the Plaquenil, but they are still there. All of these drugs have some sort of toxicity level, and we are watching her blood tests to make sure shes not experiencing toxicity sickness as a direct side effect from her medications.\n\nSo along with her depression, she is experiencing hives, numb toes/fingers, swelling, muscle pain, joint pain, fatigue, digestive issues, and lack of sleep.\n\nPresent: She\'s recently had some problems with her close friends becoming very distant, due to her not being able to make plans during the week, and often having to cancel plans on the day of because she doesn\'t know how she will feel on a daily basis. She\'s tried explaining this to them, but mostly they speak apologetically, but dont try making plans with her more recently. One friend has been especially hard on her, as Sara attended her bachelorette party, drove everyone around town that night(while Sara was not working at that time, as she had to leave her job because of time missed due to her illness) and didnt receive any money for gas, she paid for her friends meal at dinner because none of the bridesmaids were going to, and she bought a nice rice cooker and lingerie as gifts for their wedding. However, she never received a thank you card from the bride, and after 2 months with no word(and hanging out together on the 4th of july), she asked her friend why she hadn\'t received one. Saras friend said she wanted to deliver it by hand but had not yet because she was busy with family parties and stuff. After that exchange, Sara figured she would receive the card by mail, but she still hasn\'t received the card yet, and frankly doesn\'t expect to get it now. She tries to be nice, but she\'s lost her patience and doesn\'t want to deal with being treated like crap anymore. \n\nAs you can imagine, Sara has been feeling pretty alone and depressed, not having much support from her friends. Her family isn\'t much better, as her mother basically told her that since shes an adult, she has to learn to deal with her problems on her own and that she can\'t lean on Mom for support forever. I thought that was really hurtful of her Mom to say, and I could tell it hurt Sara alot too. She has her sister for some support, but her sister has been in Africa all summer working at a school for kids, and hasn\'t had much time to talk to Sara or spend time together, and she\'s going back to University in the fall to start her sophmore year. \n\nI try to be there for Sara as much as I can, but I know its hard for her seeing me doing things that i know she would want to but can\'t, for example I play in a weekly softball league with some friends. I try not to talk about it in front of her because i know how it makes her feel knowing she can\'t go to stuff like that, and try to limit the things I do so I dont remind her that she can\'t do stuff she used to, but I can\'t live cooped up at home with her all the time, and she knows she can\'t ask that of me, but she still feels lonely and I feel bad for her too for having to stay home alone by herself. We have 2 dogs so she\'s not completely alone, but more often than not she spends her time alone at home sleeping trying to get some rest to feel better.\n\nI want to help her as much as I can, but sometimes it gets tough, and she can take out her frustration on me. I don\'t blame her for wanting to vent, but sometimes it turns into attacks on me and how I dont care because I want to do things she can\'t, or that I won\'t leave work early to come home to her sooner. I know she means well, and she always ends up apologizing for taking things out on me when she does. I just want to know what more I can do for her, I dont have depression, am perfectly healthy, and have many friends, so its difficult for me to relate to what she\'s going through being sick all the time, being depressed, not having many friends, and not being able to do things she used to, and she has used that against me more than once after getting frustrated when i try to understand what she\'s going through. I\'ve lost my temper and gotten frustrated as well, but I always apologize after and try to make things better for us both. I love her with everything I have, its just hard sometimes when I get back a message saying something like ""No you dont"" when i say i love her or miss her.\n\nWhat can I do, as a spouse who tries to comfort his future wife, when she starts to get upset at me through her frustration? I have suggested support groups, but didnt get much of a response. Her family had suggested therapy once, and she flat out refused. She doesn\'t like taking her depression meds because she feels like she has to take them ""to be normal"", and ive tried supporting her and tried breaking that mindset by reminding her that her meds dont make her abnormal, just like someone with diabetes is still normal even though they have to take insulin to live. Im not great with articulating things in a way that doesn\'t sound blunt or rude, so Im turning to you guys for help.\n\nTLDR I spent a long time typing, dont think for a second im going to summarize a nuanced story with many details.\n\nI am at work now, so I can answer questions for a little bit, but once im at home i wont be able to answer as much.'"
bromelain,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/zq4sj3/30m_with_strange_unspecific_symptoms/,b'30m with strange unspecific symptoms',,"b'I\'ve been having strange blisters/folliculitis (sparse/disseminated) for the past 6 months that included some, though not severe, nerve pain and mild pruritis on every part of my body even where there are no blisters. The blisters started on my back and after a few months they reached my neck and my face. When the blisters reached my face I felt a burning nerve pain deep in my nose, in my ear and the upper neck area and a swelling deep in my ear and nose. During this time I developed various symptoms: numbness deep in the ear, nose and the upper neck area, muscle weakness, involuntary muscle contractions that pulled my neck in one or the other direction (not cramps, the contractions were light), change in gait, vertigo and dryness deep in my nose and ear. Now for about a month the pain is decreasing but the swelling, especially in the ear seems to be increasing. My tongue and lips are visibly swollen. The symptoms surge and diminish in cycles of about 2-3 days (no correlation to what I eat), getting slightly worse every cycle.\n\nI\'m very fit, eat healthy and don\'t do drugs. All my blood values are perfect except for slightly increased transferrin levels (58%). I\'ve been tested for Adeno, Coxsackie, Cytomegalia, Entero, Ebstein Barr, Tick-Born Encephalitis, HSV 1 and 2, Parvo B19, Variezella, HIV as well as Borreliosis. All negative. An MRI (skull/brain and neck) and a CT (skull/brain) have been done - nothing. The folliculi have been tested - nothing. My throat has been tested for fungi and bacteria - nothing exept for the typical throat bacteria. Two neurologists have tested me for neurological issues (reflexes, cold sensitivity, vibration) - everything working too well for any specific neurological disease, tough they acknowledged that my gait is ""robotic"".\n\nI tried the following without any success: ignoring it and carry on with life, corticoids (ear/nose droplets and skin creme), vitamins/nutrients (vitamin B complex, vitamin D, zinc), bromelain, paracetamol, ibuprofen, disinfecting ear droplets.\n\nThe only thing that helps to a very limited extent is ear/nose oil. Sometimes when I put that in I get a burning feeling in my nose/ear and my symptoms improve a bit.\n\nWith this disease I can\'t talk for more than like 5-10 minutes, go outside, shower (makes it particularly worse), work or anything similar.

When the numbing wore off, she noticed an odd sensation between #3 and #4, like it was too tight maybe and there was a sharp edge on #3, and bottom teeth were hitting #4 (that housed an old root canal from 10+ years ago) more than normal.\n\nSo, she went back in to remove the sharp edge. Tooth #3 was made shorter so then #4 got hit even more. The odd pressure sensation turned to irritation. Felt like something cutting into her gums. Back at dentist, the pain couldn't be localized (BOTH #3 and #4 reacted to pressure). On to an Endodontist who also couldn't localize pain - teeth didn't react to cold/hot. Few days pass  more pain. Asked dentist to remove the filling on #3. The next day, more tooth pain. Tension and pressure in jaw/ears and loud popping of jaw when eating. Start of TMJ symptoms. Got CT scan to check sinuses  all fine here. More pain in face - and horrible pain on #3 and #4 when tapped. Filed down tooth # 3 and #4 so no weight was hitting them. Felt almost immediate relief to jaw/face and tooth??? Which seemed strange.\n\nEndodontist still couldnt localize the pain. xray said pulp canal on #3 very large and could be hitting the filling. Told to wait a bit longer. Pain continues - and losing appetite/weight/night wakeups/ nausea\n\nPrescribed Nortriptyline 25 mg. Pain continues and went back to do root canal on #3 with endodontist but when numbed, she could still feel pressure, so maybe it was not the tooth itself, but nerve related. Trigeminal Neuralgia mentioned as a possible diagnosis. Later primary doctor said it was not Trigeminal Neuralgia but that nerve got hit and it would heal.\n\nBegan supplements to support nerve health: Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Inositol, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Vitamin C . Multi-vitamin. Vitamin D3.\n\nRelief for 2 days but then quit steroids, and woke up in tooth pain again. Saw a neuromuscular dentist who analyzes bite and deals with TMJ issues. She said right jaw was working VERY hard to bite. She said #3 and #4 were filed so short that they werent hitting at all. She relaxed the jaws and made  splint to keep the jaw in a more neutral position. She recommended a sleep study to test for apnea and then a custom orthotic device to keep the jaw in a neutral position (I am still debating ). She said it was a TMJ flare-up on the right side and fixing this could end the pain in my tooth.\n\nThe splint was causing more pain because it was hitting #4 so stopped wearing. Week 6, visted neurologist. He said it was for sure not trigeminal neuralgia type 1, MAYBE type 2 but doubted it. Said he would treat me as if it were TN2 and prescribed Gabapentin and stopped Nortriptyline. Started to feel less pain after 1st dose of gabapentin.\n\nSaw new dentist, for another opinion. Suggested maybe it was a nerve ganglion affected when injecting lidocaine during the initial visit way back when. If so, it should heal in 2 - 6 months. Got an ozone injection into the right nerve ganglion ??? which helped pain temporarily but then came back. Went back to get 2nd ozone injection. Pain stayed about the same, maybe a bit less (trying to figure out if ozone caused pain to improve last time or the Gabapentin + Nortriptyline). Wore mouth guard for 3 hours but caused some mild pain in face/ears so took guard out. Pain in face/ears increased. Restarted Nortriptyline and continued Gabepentin\n\nTalked to old dentist from many years ago before this all happened, she said it sounds like a failed root canal on #4 and that its just old and presenting in a way first endodontist wasnt familiar with. Recommendations was to get root canal redone or the tooth removed.\n\nAny ADVICE/IDEAS ???? The pain has been relentless . Open to ideas and thoughts - anything to relieve the pain! Maybe take the tooth out??  I've also heard roots can grow back so root canal redo?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ti2g8vr9dw31.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=503999e3539eb92de98956a80190ec70c3323fdb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iardv8vr9dw31.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e7bb0242ad4bceab4c4a302bf1c25b2d0a310ec4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ljkgelvr9dw31.jpg?width=1168&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=91dba2a939594fdee4d002b357cc30462e661290\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/puqso8vr9dw31.jpg?width=1168&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fc49ad3671544d2ca17b001504f45ca86f44111c"""

I have had mental issues for over 20 years and has been on all kinds of meds, but always with bad side effects, so I have never stayed on them.\n\nThe last couple of months I have been researching Nootropics online, and beside vitamins, I started taking 1000 mg L-Tyrosin and 1000 mg L-Tryptophan. I helped me a little, but not enough so after about 2 month I stopped and began taking 200 mg 5-htp and 500 mg Mucuna Dopa.\n\nIt really helps, I kinda feel all of my symptoms are gone and the side effects are small. But I read online that you need to cycle of both and that long term use is not a good idea. But then again, meds also has long term consequences.\n\nI dont know what to do, my doctor/shrink will not discuss this with me and both Mucuna and 5-HTP is not sold in my country.\n\nIs there anyone on here that has personal experience with Mucuna and 5-HTP?

prozac,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/13xvh0r/im_quitting_prozac_cold_turkey/,"b""I'm Quitting Prozac Cold Turkey""",,"b'Hi, everyone. I\'m coming here for support, advice, and any tips or info concerning my quitting Prozac.\n\n**The short version:** I\'ve been on generic fluoxetine for almost 10 years, up to 40 mg per day for the past six years or so. I did contact my doctor to get advice about quitting, and she suggested just going cold turkey. It\'s been one week since my last dose, and symptoms haven\'t really started yet. I also have a prescription for .25 mg alprazolam (Xanax) tablets that I take only intermittently for panic attacks, and I\'m on birth control hormones to regulate my menstrual cycle.\n\nEdit: I said this in the comments, but I\'ll say it here, too: My psychiatrist is pretty much just collecting a paycheck. She\'s always been dismissive of me, and never really does anything but throw pills at me. When I discussed the side effects I was having, her solution was to up my dose. When I told her about the crippling insomnia, she said, ""Maybe you don\'t need that much sleep."" On the day I spoke with her, I had been awake for almost three days straight. I just started crying when she said that, and she just continued down the checklist. ""Any suicidal thoughts? Any feelings of restlessness?"" And when I told her I was having suicidal thoughts, she just checked the box and moved on.\n\nDuring this last appointment, I sent her some information on tapering Prozac and she didn\'t even read it. Unfortunately, she\'s the only person I can see right now in my network. Everyone else has a waiting list months long, and the out-of-network doctors I\'ve contacted won\'t take new patients or have even longer waiting lists. Tapering is not an option for me right now. And I can\'t live with the side effects. I got so desperate for sleep that I was considering drinking, and I\'m allergic to alcohol. I can\'t stay on this stuff anymore, certainly not for months while I try to find a doctor who will listen to me.\n\nI\'ve seen the Surviving Antidepressants site. I didn\'t like what I saw. People are so desperate to avoid symptoms of withdrawal that they taper for years. I don\'t want to do that. I\'d rather go through the withdrawal and come out clean than flirt with it for a few years and reinforce my dependence on it.\n\n**The long, LONG version:** Ten years ago, I was having frequent panic attacks, nightmares, flashbacks, and freakouts. I went to a mental health center hoping that I could talk to a therapist, but a doctor there just gave me a prescription for 10 mg Prozac. It helped for a few months, but when it stopped working, I saw another doctor who changed my prescription to another SSRI. I had a terrible reaction to it, so she switched me twice more with much the same results. She eventually put me back on Prozac, this time at 20 mg. After that, I switched doctors again, and she upped my dose to 40 mg. This is the same doctor I\'m seeing now.\n\nI never really felt as if the Prozac was doing anything, but I stayed on it because I was afraid of any possible withdrawal symptoms. I frequently forgot to take it, and would suffer wild mood swings (keeping in mind that when I forgot to take the Prozac, I was also forgetting my hormones). Over the past few years, though, several things have changed that have had me contemplating quitting.\n\nFirst, I did see a therapist about five years ago. She helped me to sort through things that were causing me PTSD, and with the therapy program, the nightmares and flashbacks went away. She also diagnosed me with autism spectrum disorder. I learned that I am prone to stimulus overload and also suffer from misophonia, and my panic attacks have almost completely stopped through management of those issues. I finally feel as if we\'ve really gotten to the root of my problems, and my life has been vastly improved by learning these things about myself.\n\nSecond, I began to suffer from intense insomnia starting a few years ago. Even though the nightmares ceased, it was like I just could not fall asleep no matter what I did. My doctor prescribed various sleep aids, none of which worked. Sleeping pills of various strengths and preparations, melatonin, valerian... I even got desperate enough to try NyQuil. They would all do the job of making me drowsy, but I still could not fall asleep, nor could I stay asleep for more than four hours at a time. I did notice, though, that whenever I would forget my medications, I would fall asleep and stay asleep much more easily. The last time I ""went off"" of my meds, I did have intense side effects, but I was able to sleep at night.\n\nThe insomnia exacerbated my feelings of fatigue, so most days I was on auto-pilot. I would sleep all day and stay up all night. My sex drive had been plummeting for a while, and I lost the ability to exercise. After having covid, I\'ve been left with shaky hands and dizziness that occur intermittently. I also have IBS caused by anxiety, and that got worse, as well. I had trouble losing weight despite being on a strict diet and exercise program. I began to think that all of these things were connected after they all improved when I forgot my meds.\n\nI asked my doctor about quitting, and she said that she had no objection. She advised that I most likely would not need to taper doses because of fluoxetine\'s long half-life and the fact that withdrawal symptoms often occur even with tapered doses.\n\nIt\'s been one week since my last dose of Prozac. I know that it\'s too early for withdrawal to kick in, but I am already experiencing dizzy spells and slight nausea. The insomnia, though, has stopped. I really do believe now that the Prozac was causing it. Because I\'m still taking my hormone pills, my mood has remained stable, unlike the times when I forgot my meds. My sex drive has started to go back to normal, and my hands are steadier. I never even thought to connect the shaking hands to Prozac until they improved this week, though that may have nothing to do with anything.\n\nAs I mentioned, I have a prescription for Xanax that I take for major panic attacks. I don\'t take it often, but now and then it helps to calm me down when other methods aren\'t working. I\'m wondering if it will be a viable option for easing withdrawal symptoms if and when they begin. My doctor said, ""I don\'t see why not,"" but couldn\'t offer much more insight than that. Any ideas on taking Xanax or a similar medication for SSRI withdrawal?\n\nI feel lucky to have the support system that I do. My husband and I live with my parents, and I have three people in the house to help me if symptoms get bad. I want to do this now, because my mom is most likely going to have knee replacement surgery soon, and she\'ll need my help to recover. I also help to take care of my dad, who is disabled (he\'s diabetic, had a stroke two years ago, and needs general help around the house), and I\'d like to get this all over with so I can keep helping him. My husband is very proactive about helping my parents, but he works full time and I don\'t want to ask him to pitch in more than he already does (he keeps up with the yard and runs errands for the household).\n\nI guess my major worry is that I\'ll be somehow unable to do my job, which is to cook and clean for everyone and help my dad around the house and with business. There are four adults living here, but I don\'t want to put more on them than I have to. They all know that I\'m going off of Prozac, and I gave them the rundown of symptoms as given to me by my doctor.\n\nI know I\'ll just have to wait and see how badly I\'m affected, but I\'m sort of hoping that someone can give me an idea of how debilitating withdrawal might be. Like, at its worst, what can I expect? Does anyone have experience with taking Xanax or a similar medication to help with SSRI withdrawal? Anyone else have any tips or advice or just a shared experience? If you made it through all of this, thank you for reading. I think posting this helped ease some of my anxiety already.'"
clonazepam,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/101ah9n/dealing_with_extreme_social_anxiety/,b'Dealing with extreme social anxiety?',,"b'(25F)\nThroughout my life, I have had trouble with casual parties and family-gatherings. They tend to not only overwhelm me, but also shut me down completely. I cope in those situations with hurting myself lightly, the pain usually distracts me. Things like, scratching to the flesh in one spot for example. \n\nIn Marriages, I tend to simply look for a secluded spot after the initial ceremony and shiver until someone notices me and takes me out of situations. The last time, my mom went to look for me because she knows I have trouble. We went walking and spend 1 hour in a clearing until I had calmed down.\n\nCasual settings like a party between friends can also trigger this extreme response from me, as long as there are 5-6 or more people around me. The most confusing part about it, is that in a work related environment it is a non-issue. There I simply function regardless of how many people I have to deal with.\n\nWhere this extreme response comes from, might be because my father\'s side of the family used to mock and bully me during family-gatherings. Things like calling me good-for-nothing, useless, never achieving anything. I understand that, that is only partly responsible. But I think it played a huge part in my developing child brain and thus now has this complete breakdown in those settings. I feel like someone is going to call me those things at any moment I\'m surrounded by people despite me having completed High-School without even trying, being so good at anything I do, people tend to avoid me when playing with me online.. It led to me having such a high standard for myself, that anything *but* the first place invokes feelings of being not good enough.\n\nIn a game\'s terms; whenever I would end up on 2nd place in a skill based game against other people, I would spend the next 7 days no-lifing the game until I\'d never lose the 1st place ever again.\n\nThat was a lot. Sorry, I didn\'t intend it to encompass half my life\'s story, but I\'m genuinely looking for advice. I can\'t keep going on like this. The feeling of panic and fear I get while being around family and groups of friends is so overwhelmingly negative, I develop bad habits because of it. And the perfectionism it created, left me standing without any friends many times online. Does anyone have any advice? I\'d really welcome it. (I also hope this doesn\'t violate the no medical advice rule. I have aspergers and was thinking there might be people here with similar problems and would like to know how they deal with it.^^"")'"

It has only really been getting worse. Yesterday, I almost passed out while getting myself food as well as almost vomiting, and loss of hearing suddenly. Before I was sick with this, I was experiencing major headaches and dizziness for like a week, then sinus infection started. I\'ve never had issues with sinus infections this bad, and I am genuinely getting scared. I also have not been hungry much, or thirsty. \n\nThirty minutes before almost passing out however, I had taken my night-time medicine that my mom gave me, and I am worried she either did something to it, or that I\'m more ill than she\'s telling me.\n\nIt\'s a long thing to explain, so please listen, because I\'m honestly getting worried. \n\nI have had issues with mental health for a while, my dad was abusive and hurt my mom a lot. My mom got cancer, and then we had to move a few times from lesser income. Never had stable friends and stuff. Then I was told I had anger issues, and was eventually released from counseling at like 10 or 11. Then puberty struck and I was really depressed for a while. One of the main factors making me so depressed, was my overbearing christian mom, who found the lord after shit went with my father. She\'s constantly listening to conspiracy theory shows, and watching political events. Around the time of puberty, I had the worst thing that could happen under a zealous mother, and I realized I like guys. I came out as gay, got yelled at, ran away, was sent to a short-term hospital, and tensions were weird the whole time. On the night I ran away, I hadn\'t taken my meds because I didn\'t want to be tired whilst walking at night. Got sent back home, even though I asked for foster care quite a lot. I didn\'t feel safe at home.\n\nNow, because of all of this, my mom makes sure I take my meds, and is very hard on me, and light on my christian brother. More drama has been happening lately, and I\'ve been feeling not very good at home. My mom still says things to my brother like ""when the rapture happens, I trust you <brother\'s name>"". And has said a few times, if things ""go to shit"", she doesn\'t trust me. She\'s a very ""end is nigh"" person. \n\nWe\'ve also been having a lot of trouble with where we live due to a few factors, but for privacy reasons I can\'t go into it too much. I just mention this because it\'s really been stressing me and my mom out. We don\'t have the money to move, but also can barely fix our house.\n\nOther than a short hospital visit like two months ago, I have been doing great on my mental health. I have actually been really happy lately, and I even got one of the things I\'ve always wanted: a partner who understands me. Even if we broke up though, friendship is strong, and it would honestly barely affect my mental health. I say all this to say: mentally, I\'m okay lately. \n\nPhysically is where the issues are, as explained above.\n\nI\'ve asked my mom what meds I take and she always gets standoffish and changes topic when she can. ""Oh, so you need to know your meds for your online friends, is that it?"" (She has some major problems with me having friends online, for literally no reason tbh. I am always safe with information) \n\nAnyways, I say all of this to ask, in your guy\'s opinion, am I worrying for no reason about being poisoned? Is this normal? My mom said the almost passing out was the sinus infection, but all I know is it makes you dizzy sometimes, and that\'s it?\n\nShe also tested me for covid btw, and made sure I saw it was negative, for whatever reason.'"

Was immediately able to self discharge and went home and ingested my partially prepared castor bean pulp.\n\nIn a fun twist of fate the ricin protein had been denatured at the point it was in the process of manufacture so I basically gave myself the world\'s biggest ricin vaccine and now have an immunity to it.\n\nSaw crisis team at A&E after admitting myself a 20 hours later and they didn\'t care.  \n\n\n  \nBasically I\'m at breaking point, I now no longer want to fight the voice in my head and as I steadily get angrier and angrier about the lack of treatment I feel like I\'m getting to the point where I\'m going to lash out and end up killing someone.

Advil,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/2ckv8p/wife_has_multiple_personalitiespersonas/,b'Wife has multiple personalities/personas?',,"b'My wife has recently revealed to me that she has two personas that she \'slips into\' when she is nervous. One is a tough Scandinavian(Maybe Icelandic? She seems kind of nordic to me, especially her name, but I\'m not sure of ""her"" ""county of origin"") woman, who wears a lot of dark and revealing clothing, and she\'s very confidant and sexually appealing. (Her words, not mine, I think my wife is always beautiful) and the other is softer woman, she is outgoing, wears bright colors and dresses, and jokingly calls herself a fairy queen, because she loves flowers or floral prints. She will go so far to wear wigs and makeup to further change her appearance. (Not completely odd, but she usually doesn\'t even wear makeup)\n\nI don\'t know if I should be worried. She doesn\'t want to talk to a therapist about it, because she is happy and it seems to help her, and I don\'t know if there is a negative effect to this.\n\nThough it worried me today when my wife told me she wanted people to refer to her as her persona\'s name when she is in that persona. These two persona\'s represent two big personality traits she **thinks** she is not, confidant and attractive.\n\nShe\'s also rarely referred to a third persona that used to ""take over for her"" when she was younger and afraid, but I\'ve never personally seen this persona, or heard her mentioned in quite some time.\n\nShe\'s has been diagnosed with PTSD because of her traumatic childhood, and I\'ve been suspecting for about 6 months that she might also be bipolar. I\'ve been reading as much as I can about it, and I\'m **not** self diagnosing, but it sound EXACTLY like her, and that worries me. She was taking a LOT of meds before she refused to see her therapist anymore and quit them all cold turkey and she hated it to the point that I have to fight her just to get her to take Advil for a headache. Her therapist didn\'t really care about her and would constantly and repeatedly tell her to do things that never worked for her, or she wouldn\'t tell her how to do them. (EX. Telling her multiple times to tap her hands when she is nervous, didn\'t work. Told her to buy anti itch cream for her She has anger problems, she bottles it up til she explodes, therapist told her to find a healthy outlet or way to express it. She asked for help on how because she honestly doesn\'t know, and she just kept saying ""Try something that works for you."" and then promptly ended the session 20 minutes early. It\'s only the first therapist we\'ve tried, but it\'s kind of put her off the idea of therapists.) Her therapist also dismissed her self harm merely because it wasn\'t cutting. My wife hits herself very hard when she does something ""wrong"" or when she is frustrated, and she\'s left bruises on her hands and arms when she bites herself for the same reason. She also obsessively scratches and picks at things. I\'ve managed to keep her from scarring her face, her chest and arms, but her shins/ankles look awful.\n\nHer life flip flopped when she moved away from her father\'s house. She didn\'t even know anything was wrong with her until she left, because even though her father is an awesome guy, he isn\'t a doctors kind of person and has a lot of stereotypical misconceptions about mental health which make my wife afraid to talk to him about her problems.. She has chronic anemia (to the point that she would be so tired she would stop where she was and lay on the floor and fall asleep. Not like narcolepsy where she would just pass out, but she would get too tired to move, purposefully lay on the floor and then sleep) and was often told she just needed a nap. Luckily her dad is a meat and potatoes kind of guy, so she was getting constant iron. But I can\'t afford that, so her only choice is iron pills, which make her sick. And most of her bad memories were repressed or she consciously ignored them and didn\'t even realize they were that bad.\n\nIt\'s frustrating as hell because I want so bad to help her. to see her run home and hug me excitedly when I come home from work like she used to when we first moved out together. But now she\'s so lonely and anxious sometimes she doesn\'t even get out of bed and just cries all day. Where we live, riding the bus isn\'t exactly convenient, and she gets extremely anxious even when in a car, so driving herself isn\'t an option now. She refuses to have roommates, because the last couple were awful. She spends the entire week home alone and she lives for the weekends, when we can leave the house together. She is terrified of leaving alone, because when she has an anxiety/panic attack, she completely shuts down, or just runs away. It\'s like fight or flight, but more like shut down or flight. \n\nShe had an anxiety attack when she was walking home in the dark about two years ago when she missed her bus home and she shut down so badly I had to leave work immediately and hunt her down in the city. Nothing happened to her, to which I am immensely relieved, but now she\'s terrified of it happening again, so she just *doesn\'t* leave the house alone, unless it\'s to check the mail.\n\nI\'m trying to get us out of the apartment we\'re in at the end of our lease, which is soon, but she\'s being stressful about that too.\n\nI\'m sorry, this turned into a kind of rant, but I guess I needed to let it out. If someone has some advice for me, please **PLEASE** message me or reply. I\'m so desperate to see my wife smile again that I would do anything. '"

I started my second course of Accutane end of January. Id taken it in 2016 and it was a miracle drug. My skin cleared up and stayed clear for three years. Unfortunately, a brief dip into lithium in late 2019 had made my skin awful again, so I decided to go back on Accutane before I scarred too much. \n\nMy normal meds are Effexor, Abilify and trazodone for sleep, plus Klonopin as needed for anxiety. The Klonopin makes me really stupid so I basically never take it. On Thursday, March 5, I went to get an IUD put in. I couldnt remember which OTC pain meds I was allowed to take - Effexor and Accutane both mess with your liver which makes some pain meds really dangerous - so I took half a Klonopin instead, figuring it would at least mellow me out through the procedure. That was about 4pm. At 7:30, I went to a dance class. Thats the last thing I remember until Saturday morning, when I woke up in a psych ward with deep gouges on both of my wrists. \n\nI had taken Klonopin before, many times - never had anything like this happen. I can only assume it was the combination of the benzodiazepine with the Accutane. (FWIW, both my regular shrink and the doctors at the ward agree.) Its absolutely horrifying to wake up in a psych ward with no memory of what happened, and then to find out you tried to kill yourself? Blackout-me really meant it, too; she cut down to tendon on one side and even wrote a suicide note. Seeing the note afterwards was surreal - the strangest part was that it wasnt anything like my normal handwriting. \n\nAll of these medications were prescribed to me by doctors I trust. Ive always been very careful with my meds and potential interactions. I even googled the combination beforehand and didnt find any known interactions. And still, Accutane almost killed me. \n\nBelieve it or not, I dont regret taking it. Im so much happier now that my skin isnt in pain all the time, now that I dont have to slather on makeup to go out. But I do want to stress that Accutane can be extremely dangerous or even deadly ESPECIALLY if you have a history of mental health issues. However careful youre being, double it. Please. I dont want anyone else to go through that hell.'"

Help.**\n\n*Edit: With regard to the migraines I mentioned - it lasted four days. I had been avoiding caffeine since the start of the Concerta because I feel I shouldn't mix the two. I thought it'd be okay since I had been on ~600mg/day and had weaned down to a max of 200mg/day prior to starting this (self-medication, I guess?). I was wrong. I have in today and took 1g of Acetaminophen, 325mg Aspirin and 100mg of caffeine, a well-known migraine-defeating cocktail...and it worked. I think now perhaps it was more caffeine withdrawal than the Concerta itself. Unsure about the hunger issue yet, as it's still morning.*\n\n\n**TLDR Edit: Caffeine withdrawals = migraines.**\n\n**EDIT: Should anyone come across this in the future using the search - now on 54mg in the morning (Concerta still) and no longer hungry.

It was passed on to me like all other pain and anger is, the virus. I use to think I hated myself until I realized that I was living someone else's life for them. If physical diseases can spread from person to person, it's obvious to me that mental diseases are the same. Fear is the ultimate epidemic. Forgiveness is the vaccine, which requires love and it's the hardest thing in all of self awareness.

I first thought I had familial inherited lipomatosis and as a result had multiple lipomas, but my derm diagnosed them as steatocystomas. I experienced an ""initial breakout"" (IB) but it was very gradual and lasted most of the course. For most people this acne/cystic IB is normal on Accutane, but since I have steatocystoma multiplex, it also seemed to trigger an steatocystoma IB! These new steatocystomas were much larger than usual, and one in particular was so large that I had to get my derm to inject steroids into it to reduce swelling a couple months ago. Right now it\'s actually slowly ejecting itself, which has never happened to any of my steatocystomas, so that\'s weird and kinda freaky lol. Time will tell whether this had any long term effect on my steatocystoma multiplex.\n\nMy experience:\n\n* **Dry lips, skin, eyes, hair**\n* **Constant exhaustion and fatigue**, so much that I\'d almost fall asleep between sets at the gym. I could sleep 10-12 hours a day and still feel tired. This combined with the dry eyes were honestly the worst side effects for me. Lips were actually fine for me because of Lanolinsee below for tips. But the EXHAUSTION! Get ready to be TIRED AF *all the time*.\n* Slightly thinner, sparser, and curlier hair. I used to get my hair thinned once or twice a year, but I don\'t think I\'ll ever need to do that again now that my hair is thinner & sparser (not sparse, just sparser).\n* Slight joint pain, mostly in the knees\n* Giant black boogers. Presumably dried blood. Gross. So much and so big that I had trouble breathing through my nose sometimes. Believe it or not I actually never picked my nose before these came into my life because I just really ever get boogers lol, and the small amount I did get I just got rid of them by blowing my nose.\n* One night I woke up a split second before a spontaneous nosebleed would ruin my sheets, but that was the one and only nosebleed I got from Accutane. See tips below for prevention.\n* On average I had to drink more water, otherwise my urine would be super dark yellow. Drinking more water didn\'t seem to have any other noticeable effects though. It\'s probably good for you in general, but it personally didn\'t alleviate exhaustion or dry lips/eyes/skin.\n* My skin, eyes, lips, and hair returned to normal after about 2-3 weeks at the end of my course. All are slightly drier than before my course, which means that my T-zone is still kind of oily, since I began with an *extremely* oily T-zone.\n* My night vision is slightly worse, and lights have a faint aura, especially at night. It\'s already better now and we\'ll see if this goes away with time but it\'s not a huge side effect for me. It could be much worse.\n* I\'m not sure if this is related but on average I had an easier time cleanly passing stool, otherwise known as the ghost poop, where you wipe and there\'s nothing there! Again, not sure if Accutane did this or if it was just a coincidence.\n* Personally I could go several days without showering because I never got dirty, sweaty, oily, or smelly. It was kind of weird lol. I used to shower every single day so that was a big change. After a while it got annoying to moisturize head to toe after every shower, so I\'d shower every other day or so.\n\nFinally, some tips:\n\n* **REMEMBER**: Everyone responds to Accutane differently.\n* **PACKAGING**: Avoid Myorisan because the packaging is impossible to deal with smh. Everyone complains about Accutane packaging but honestly just get Claravis and once you remove the foil containing the pills from all the packaging and it\'s actually super duper easy to get your pills \\\\_()_/ That\'s right, let me repeat: You can remove the pill foil from all the packaging. Tell your dermatologist to be explicit about the brand when sending the prescription to the pharmacy, and they\'ll usually do their best to fulfill the request.\n* **HAIRCARE**: **Stop using shampoo.** You don\'t need it. Accutane targets your sebaceous glands, and without sufficient oil they usually produce, your hair can fall out very easily. I experienced this last night (a month after I completed my course): I washed my hair with just a little bit of shampoo and every time I gently ran my hand through my hair, a couple of strands would fall out, and it just would not stopif this happens to you, stop running your hands through your hair, put a leave-in conditioner in, get out of the shower, and stop using shampoo henceforth. I cleanse my hair with conditioner every few days and put in a leave-in conditioner most days. Also, in case you\'re interested in hair color, I was able to bleach & dye my hair from black to blond (ashy blond balayage, about a 7 or 8) in one sitting but that might be because I have thick and strong hair, and I was super oily everywhere, including my scalp/hair, before starting Accutane. Be gentle with your hair and it will thank you. Washing and drying (towel or otherwise), be gentle!\n* **HOLY GRAIL ITEM #1**: **LANOLIN** nipple cream. This is the single most important item throughout my Accutane journey. If I had to pick ONE item that made the course bearable it would be **LANOLIN** nipple cream. Trust me, it\'s cheap and *one small tube* will last you almost your entire course. No matter *how* dry your lips, this will keep them super moist super long. I put it on overnight and it makes a world of difference. If I fall asleep and forget to put it on, I\'ll wake up with super chapped lips, to the point of cracking if I yawn. Even then, a minute or so after I apply it to super chapped lips, my lips magically healed. What makes Lanolin much better than any other product is that it integrates with your skin and seeps into it. Lip balm, vaseline, and Aquaphor all just sit on top of your lips. They work by creating a seal that keeps the moisture in, but it does nothing to increase the moisture. Aquaphor or lip balm will dry up and leave a nasty film on top of my lips that I constantly needed to wipe off. Lanolin never does that. It literally seeps into your lips and moisturizes from inside AND keeps the moisture in. It\'s also tasteless and odorless, and if you want that lip gloss look you get that for free. That\'s probably the only downside I can think of, that you might not want glossy lips. You should only use Dr. Dan\'s (hydrocortisone) sparingly, and definitely not in the long term, but honestly you shouldn\'t put steroid cream on your lips if you don\'t have to. I have both Dr. Dan\'s and lanolin, and lanolin actually healed about the same, if not better. You can even stick a little bit up your nose to prevent nosebleeds. It\'s safe for mom and baby since it\'s meant for sore nipples from breastfeeding, meaning you can literally eat it and be fine, which is comforting for something you\'re constantly putting on your lips. You only need a tiny, tiny, tiny bit each application, and that will last you probably until the next time you eat or drink something. There are some lip balms coming out that use lanolin because people are finally realizing what they\'re missing out on. I have a bunch of Aquaphor and lip balm lying around now because lanolin was just so much superior. Literally if I could give every Accutane user just ONE tip I would say **LANOLIN. LANOLIN. LANOLIN.**.\n* **HOLY GRAIL ITEM #2**: CeraVe moisturizing cream with pump. This is some heavy duty moisture and it\'s safe for sensitive skin! I used it head to toe, including face and basically every part of my entire body, even eyelids. It lasts all night, and the pump makes it super easy to dispensealso just feels better than having to open the tub and stick your fingers in all the time.\n* **HOLY GRAIL ITEM #3**: Systane/Refresh eye drops and/or gel drops. The drops are good for temporary eye dryness relief. The gel drops blur your vision for a little bit but the relief lasts a little longer. The gels that come in a tube (not gel drops) are thicker, harder to use, and are really only meant for bedtime.\n* **SUN**: Obviously, avoid the sun whenever possible, and wear sunscreen! One time I was at the park for the whole afternoon, and even though I liberally applied 3 layers of sunscreen, I still got sunburned. It\'s no joke. This is what my thigh looked like that day: https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/8o7uwd/my_thigh_after_a_few_hours_in_the_sun_today_i/\n* Do *not* take any tetracycline class of antibiotics (for example, doxycycline) while you\'re on Accutane. I got a few bacterial infections during my course and luckily there are several other classes of antibiotics you can use that are okay to take with Accutane.\n\nThat\'s it! Overall I\'m happy I decided to take it, at least so far. During my course my skin was insanely smoothto the point of shining like handsome Squidward. It\'s back to normal now but smoother than before the tane. We\'ll see if there are any adverse long-term side effects. Fingers crossed! Finally, I\'ll just leave you with, you guessed it, **LANOLIN SAVES LIPS** and my lips literally *never* bled because of lanolin. Godspeed.'"

Sure it wont work as good as occasional use where you can really feel it but thats the self control part to not take more and only your prescribed dosage. \n\nI went from not leaving my house for 3 years to being able to feel somewhat alive again and feel like a human being with life goals and hope.'"

I\'m the only one who is fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

She\'s also starting to cough a little. I suspected she might have COVID.\n\n- I\'m completely fine.\n\n\nFriday\n\n- I woke up feeling normal\n\n- By noon, I had a mild headache and congestion.

My muscles and joints felt sore as I lied down, with my pelvis and back feeling specially strained. My skin is very sensitive, feeling almost like a sunburn all over mybody, and even the touch of my clothes bothers me. This feels a LOT like the side effects of the JJ vaccine, so I\'m starting to worry.\n\n- I also started with a bit of dry cough, and a sneeze here and there.\n\n- Around 6 pm, more of the same but much worse. From this pointon I could not get out of bed. The act of sitting up alone felt like such a giant effort that it made me nauseous and caused me to almost vomit. I had to take a pill for this. I also felt very cold and it took me a while to get warm.\n\n- Later that night the nausea and the cold were better, but not the rest. I took a couple of antivirals (flu meds) and a Vick Pyrena and tried to get some sleep.\n\n\nSaturday\n\n- When I got up I actually thought I was doing better, but as the minutes went by i realized I wasn\'t.\n\n- My skin still burned and my joints and muscles were still sore. It felt better if I stayed in bed with a blanket, but after a while my body would get tired and ache from that position and I had to shift.\n\n- I was very weak. If I stood up and walked for a few minutes I could feel my muscles getting strained. If I pushed a little more, I would feel intense nausea again to the point I had to take deep breaths and lie on the floor to avoid vomiting. It felt like doing an intense workout on an empty stomach.\n\n- I started coughing with phlegm.\n\n- I do not feel agitated at all. I don\'t have any respiratory complications other than sneezing and coughing. It\'s just my joints and muscles.\n\n- I had to stay in bed all day and had only a couple of meals. I did try to stay hydrated and took the flu meds again, the Pyrena at night, and the nausea pill.\n\n\nSunday\n\n- Pretty much the same as the day before. My joints are better but my muscles are not. I get out of bed, and a few minutes later I feel like my legs and abdomen are going to cramp.\n\n- I had no appetite but I forced myself to eat something in an attempt to regain energy.\n\n\nMonday\n\n- Feeling slightly better. I actually woke up feeling a little hungry. My skin is actually feeling better.\n\n- I\'m coughing more, mix of dry and phlegm.\n\n- I\'d like to go get tested or to the doctor to know for sure, but I can\'t even walk without feeling my legs tired or getting nauseous, though I did notice that now it takes me longer to get to that point.\n\n- Meanwhile my mom is still sick but not nearly as bad as me.

I was also self-medicating with high doses of psychedelic mushrooms and marijuana as well as other drugs. My therapist knows all about it. \n\nLong story short, about a week ago, I took a bunch of mushrooms and went into a psychosis state, I tried killing myself by drug overdose with other heavy drugs. (Im ok now!)\n\nLuckily, I made it home and passed out, Waking up the next day. I went to my therapist the next day told her what happened, and she sent me to the psych ward.\n\nIve been out of the psych ward since last Wednesday, and two days to before leaving they bumped my Effexor from 150 mg to 225. Once I got home, I noticed effects right away. I would say I had a super heightened mood, super energetic, and couldnt stop talking. It was kinda as if I was on cocaine. I didnt like it at all.\n\nNow, lets get to this weekend due to my suicide attempt my friends have been coming over more often and forcing me to get out of the house. \n\nFriday night, we go out bowling and I smoke a lot of weed. I get home about 5 AM Saturday morning and I would say I slept for a good 12 hours with the help of 200 mg of trazodone that my buddy had supplied me. I feel like absolute dog shit all Saturday and spend up smoking weed all day to Chinese the pain.\n\nRoll around a Saturday night Im all alone and I say probably fall asleep again around 4 AM but this time I wake up around 8 to 10 AM with a little sleep. Im frustrated, tired and dont feel well! I try to get rest all day Sunday. Nothing. Another day feeling like death.\n\nNow let me tell you that this whole past week, Ive been taking the 225 mg of Effexor. I felt hungover all weekend. Let me also add I dont drink, and havent for five years. \n\nMy symptoms included, but did not stop at Cold sweats, hot sweats, chills, Migraines, blurred vision, impaired speech, and walk, dizziness, confusion, insomnia to the point of being awake for days, nausea like no other vomiting, lack of appetite, heighten, depression, and suicidal thoughts. \n\nMonday morning I have to take a friend to the airport at 4 AM two hours away on zero sleep. \n\nI managed to get to the airport and back on four energy drinks.  I failed to realize I had barely any food or water in my system. I did smoke a large amount of weed before going to the airport. I was doing this to ease the sickness. I was feeling. I also have a psychiatrist appointment that day, I had planned to bring all this up\n\nAs Im getting to the psychiatrist, I feel like Im going to die. I have to park about half a mile away and walk. The whole time Im drenched in sweat and having all the same side effects. Let me also add that the lack of sleep was making me start the hallucinate and be a little delusional.\n\nI get into the psychiatrist office they set me down at the computer to do the pre-screening. Thats when I start really feeling ill. I am sweating profusely in this cold building, and I am going to throw up, I look around for a trashcan, Nothing. My vision starts to blur in my motor skills. Kind of go to shit.\n\nI get up to walk to the bathroom down the hall and around the corner. I made it about 10 feet and projectile vomit all over the wall. I try to keep walking to the bathroom again projectile vomiting Probably another 10 feet down the walk. And then once more right after the second. I fall down against the wall and shout for a nurse. They called the ambulance and thats when everything was kind of a blur.\n\n As Im leaving the therapist, I ask him should I stop taking the extra 75, and he told me its up to the hospital whatever they say, the doctor in ER knows nothing about depression meds, she said she has no idea.\n\nThe hospital ran blood, urine heart brain, and the rest of the usual tests,Everything came out fine.\n\n I mentioned pain in my lower, right stomach. So they did a CAT scan and said my appendix was swollen and I could have appendicitis. They told me if I feel pain in the area or get a fever come back to the ER immediately and released me with no meds and really no information. \n\nI get home I get some food and still feel like dog shit, I manage to fall asleep around 6 PM waking up around 8 PM. I wake up, still feeling nauseous and gassy, but not as bad as I was earlier. \n\nI dont have a thermometer at home, but I did wake up hot and sweating.\n\nI took a regular dose of liquid, melatonin, and hopefully a knock out for the rest of the night and feel better in the morning because this aint cutting it!\n\nI guess my question is, am I safe to cut out the 75 mg until further notice due to only being on the dose for a short period of time? Or will I have withdrawal symptoms also as anyone else experienced anything like this?\n\n\n****Edit to the post ****\nIt ended up being appendicitis, probably brought on by the drug abuse.'"

influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10u6tnw/scared_of_rabies_possible_exposure_2_months_ago/,"b'Scared of rabies, possible exposure 2 months ago, living in fear.'",,"b' \n\nHi guys, I live in the western part of the USA (California) and in a very populated city; we see no bats here, but where I live, rabid bats are found, but not near humans.\n\nSo two months ago. I parked my car outside a public parking lot, and there were a lot of cars there. I accidentally parked my vehicle very close to the car next to me, and it was tough to get in and out. I don\'t remember if I was getting out or getting into my car, but while doing that, I felt a pinprick sensation on my left foot. At first, I thought ok, don\'t panic; you might have brushed it against something else, like my car door or something else; I could not look down to see if there was a bat because there was not enough space even to open my car door, I parked that badly, but I remember I did not touch it on my car door; at least that is what I remember (Maybe I did: or I did not, smh).\n\nWhen I got home hours later, I touched my foot and noticed that a bit of part of my skin was peeled off, and boom, there I was; my mind went straight to rabies; there is only a discoloration (hyperpigmentation) in that area, and on that discoloration, small brown spot, (hyperpigmentation) I see very tiny two pinprick marks, not sure if it is related to that. Maybe the bite happened close to that area, I don\'t know, but I don\'t see any bites, or holes or anything like it; I see some ""pinpricks, that I think are pinpricks, maybe they are, maybe they are not (if you have a picture of a pinprick bite or pinpricks, please show me if you can, or if you have a bat bite picture because, on google, there is no good one).\n\nStill, I wonder if they are legit pinpricks or if my skin made them because of something else; it does not hurt when I touch or feel them. Still, bat bites cannot be noticeable to the naked eye, which scares me even more. The spot is still there, but I don\'t think it has anything to do with it; the location that happened is close to that area, but maybe it is on another part that I did not see. That is what scares me the most about bat bites; you might get bit without noticing where you got bit and can\'t even see it. I also get a very weird sensation on my foot that I felt a pinprick sensation. Sometimes that place would burn, itch, and sting.\n\nSo, I thought a bat had come from under the car and bit me, or it was just there. I did not see it, or it bit me when I was getting into my car, and I went straight under the car again; every scenario was in my head. I was wearing socks and shoes, and I thought that it was impossible that, in that small space, he would have bitten me.\n\nThere are no bats in my area, but rabid bats are found in the county where I live. I think that I am that unlucky one that stumbled upon a bat, did not see him but got bit, and my mind is constantly busy because I am afraid that in 3 months, I won\'t be here anymore. And to add, one month has passed, but some say it takes up to 1-3 months, even a year. So the anxiety is not going away. So I went to the doc yesterday, doc said highly unlikely a bat bite, but if I want, I can get vaccinated. My primary doc said not to even worry about it because what I am saying is almost impossible.\n\nI know there is a high chance I am overreacting. So I am sorry again for writing here, but I can\'t help it; I am terrified, and I am convinced that I have it, but at the same time, I think I don\'t; at the same time, I think I am that unlucky person who got bit without realizing that it was a bat. So sorry again, and I will understand if you don\'t reply, but if you do, I highly appreciate it.'"

Don't leave them out for you to absentmindedly use out of sight out of mind. \n\n*Please don't hoard.* It actually makes the situation worse for everyone. I want people to get just what they need for their family for one month, and that's it. If we need to self-quarantine, no one wants people in the streets looking for TP because people got greedy, thus keeps spreading.\n\nAlso, one last thingbe kind to each other and remember that for a lot of healthcare workers, retail people and others dealing with the public this is not pleasant. They are worried for their own health and safety so please consider them in all this.\n\nEdit: more information is coming out regarding what can help with symptoms and recovery. I'm getting my information from a virologist and my nurse spouse so I'm revising information to help you treat yourself at home.\n\nFor fever:  NSAIDs like ibuprofen are not reccomended because it reduces inflammation and might dampen your immunoresponseacetamenophen/paracetamol is okay. You want to manage your fever but not suppress itfevers are what stops viruses from multiplying in your body, symptoms become worse as viral load increases. \n\nIf you have a cough, a humidifier or a shower may help ease it as humid air is easier on your lungs. Gargle salt water for a sore throat, and honey to soothe. \n\nIf you live in the northern hemisphere, you may be vitamin D deficient due to lack of sun and low levels of UVB light over winter. Vitamin D is essential for a strong immune system and helps fight viral infections. While in quarantine, try to at least sit outside for 15-20 minutes in the sun if it's warm enough."""

I\'ve had a recurrent rash above my lips since January, and it has never completely gone away although the severity flares up from time to time. There is one rash on each side of my top lip, pictured below.\n\nSome info about me:\n\nI\'m a 22 year old cisgender white woman living in the Mid-Atlantic US. I\'m 5\'9"" and about 155 lbs. \n\nI\'ve been diagnosed with depression, generalized anxiety disorder, chronic migraine, and mild asthma. I suffered from pretty severe eczema as a child, and though it has improved, it has not gone away completely and I get mild patches from time to time. I also frequently experience indigestion, constipation, and other GI issues. I had a laprascopic cholecystectomy in 2017. I have a severe allergy to nightshades (tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, eggplant). I have painful periods including severe cramps, though I have an IUD now which mitigates the symptoms.\n\n I currently take 125mg Sertraline daily, Ativan as needed for anxiety (I usually take 1-2 per month), Nabumetone as needed for migraine, DHE nasal spray as needed for migraine, and a monthly injection of Emgality for migraine. Albuterol inhaler as needed for asthma. \n\nI\'ve had this rash above my lips since January. First, it was only on the left side of my upper lip, though not actually on the lip itself. I chalked it up to dry winter weather, but the rash has persisted for several months now. About 6-8 weeks ago, another rash appeared above my lips, this time on the right side. It is almost like a mirror of the other rash. At its worst, it is red, itchy, and sometimes ""oozy."" The rashes will usually improve, with most of the redness and itchiness going away, though I can still feel a difference in texture.\n\nFor treatment at home, I\'ve tried a few things: over the counter eczema cream (which sometimes helps with redness, but doesn\'t do much to actually get rid of the rash), Aquaphor, and a [lip balm](https://eczemahoneyco.com/products/eczema-honey-nourishing-lip-balm) from Eczema Honey, which helps with moisture and itching but again doesn\'t actually do much for the rash itself. \n\nAny ideas what this might be?

I have dry skin/eczema, so I figured it was just a reaction.  A day or so later I noticed that my lymph nodes in my face/neck and salivary glands (all except the ones under my tongue) were all swollen.  I also had what I thought were a bunch of ingrown hairs or cystic acne.  While I have had acne before, this was four or five bumps in several patches on the bottom half of my face -- way too many to be happening at once.  The bumps are raised, hard, red, and painful.

I was vaccinated as a child and more recently in 2019.  Tests for mumps, mono, and Epstein Barr all came back negative.  Standard blood tests came back fine with no elevated WBC.  It is not related to a stone because the swelling changes day-to-day and is in multiple salivary glands.  No fever, but I am a bit more tired than normal.\n\nSwelling in my salivary glands has mostly gone down, but is not totally gone 1.5 weeks later.  The mystery bumps on my face are starting to go away, but there are still a few that are very painful. My lymph nodes are still enlarged in my face.\n\nThis may or may not be relevant, but I have had other mystery illnesses that I think point to some sort of autoimmune disorder:\n\n* swelling/pain/itchiness around one or both my eyes for several days at a time that is sudden onset (the only reliable thing to make it go away is tacrolimus ointment);\n* joints that are extraordinarily painful for a few weeks then get better overnight;\n* bouts of multiple kidney stones (I had to have a stent put in a kidney for one of those times);\n* pericarditis (a single occurrence and it was before the Covid vaccine);\n* dry eye syndrome (recurrent cornea erosion) so bad it scarred my cornea (which I had to have surgically scraped);  This was on and off for several months, then it went away completely;\n* rashes over my body that come and go (which I treat liberally with hydrocortisone cream);\n* ""allergies"" that make it difficult for me to breathe (I have been tested for allergies several times and it always comes back negative); I have one known food allergy for mushrooms;\n* oddly high blood pressure (150/100) that comes and goes;\n* twelve years ago I had two discs in my neck (C5-6, C6-7) disintegrate completely overnight with no warning.  The damage was so bad doctors who saw my MRIs asked me if I had been in an auto accident; I ended up going to Germany to have replacement discs put in because surgeons here in the states were worried that a fusion would cause more discs to fail.\n\nI know, I know.  I read this list back myself and it\'s a rambling mess of medical issues.  I have seen doc after doc to treat each of these things individually.  The only success I\'ve had is to wait a few days/weeks/months for the issue to go away.

influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/ic4onb/advice_for_those_on_the_fence_about_starting/,b'Advice for those on the fence about starting Accutane',,"b'So I officially started my Accutane journey December 16th 2019.\n\nI\'m now nearing the end of my treatment! Due to be finished September 16th.\n\nMy treatment has been a long one: 40, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40, 60 (I am 77kg btw or 170 pounds)\n\nI\'m not happy about COVID-19 Lockdowns but if it were to happen anytime, now is a good one while I\'m on accutane lol. My skin is now very clear. The only issue I deal with is redness + dry flaky skin which I think will subside after my treatment ends.\n\nAnyways I wanted to give my take on the whole experience and some advice for anyone like I was on this subreddit browsing it years before before I finally gave in on giving Accutane a shot.\n\n1. IF YOU ARE 23+ AND STILL DEALING WITH MODERATE CYSTIC ACNE, STOP WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING AND GET ON ACCUTANE ASAP\n\nThis is the key piece of advice I\'d like to impart on you. I recently went through + cleaned up all of my iphone photos from 2012 to now. It is crazy the flucuations my skin has gone through. I\'d had battles with moderate cystic acne since I was 18 years old. Every year that passed, I would try new treatments. I had tried everything:\n\nBenzoyl Peroxide (used for 2 years on the infamous ""[acne.org](https://acne.org)"" regime. Likely caused permanent aging effects to my skin and ruined it\'s hydration)\n\nMinocycline/Doxycycline (Mino worked well but shouldn\'t be used long term, likely fucked my immune system up possibly irreparably)\n\nCurology + Biore Sunscreen (cleared up my skin perfectly, until I got bold and decided to add tretinoin... oh what a poor decision that was)\n\nTretinoin Topical from Curology (caused the worst breakout of my life lol... right during senior year college job interviews)\n\nDairy-Free + Grain-Free + 0 Process Sugar Diet (one good thing to come out of acne, is that I will likely stick with this type of diet for the rest of my life anyways. If I live to 100+, then I can thank acne for that)\n\nCountless Products + Supplements (soaps, moisturizers, sunscreens, serums, antioxidants, vitamins, I am a skincare + supplement/nootropic expert as a 26 year old male, this is not normal haha)\n\nDaily Meditation for Stress Reduction (another good thing that acne has contributed to, I now have a iron mind)\n\nThis was all over an 8 YEAR PERIOD. And the basic summary is: a lot of this stuff worked well for anywhere from 3 months to a year.... until each one randomly stopped working.\n\nI always told myself every year: ""Oh acne is just a childhood condition, I\'m sure it will all be gone when I\'m 19/20/21/22/23/24/25/26""\n\nEach year would pass, and the acne would return inexplicably, sometimes at the worst possible times.\n\nTimes when I had just gotten my life together and was on some serious momentum to progress socially and financially. And BAM cystic acne would appear. Sometimes 1-3 quarter sized cysts would pop out of nowhere. This would crush my social confidence quite a bit, and understandably so. As someone who would do lots of public speaking, social media videos where my face is on-camera, and constantly meeting new people, it is crazy to go to bed one night with clear skin and RANDOMLY wake up with a HUGE cyst.\n\nThat\'s the one thing I\'ve noticed with my acne, it is pretty much completely fucking random. I basically became a witch doctor trying all these random treatments thinking I could control my acne. But that\'s the thing if you have ANY Cystic acne (even if it is what I would consider a ""smaller cyst"" about the size of the circle on a PS4 controller) at age 23+ there is no ""controlling it"".\n\nCystic acne is not normal. What most people (80%) consider acne as is tiny little bumps that go away after 1-2 days with 0 scarring. That\'s what life is like for the clear-skinned. For whatever reason if you are reading this, you were born with genetics that for some reason you now have cystic acne.\n\nThe ONLY way to have a near guaranteed chance of fixing this issue is to take Accutane NOW.\n\nYes, the side-effects of accutane are annoying. But as Tony Robbins says ""You will only change when the pain of not changing is worst than the pain of change"".\n\nLet me tell you, with accutane you have to ""sacrifice"" \\~5 months of your life in exchange for years of clear skin.\n\nBut at age 23+ if you are still getting cystic acne of any kind, that miracle topical cure is not waiting right around the corner. Accutane is the miracle cure. Be grateful as fuck that it exists and just go get a script.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Consider the Cumulative Emotional Effects of Acne on Your Life + Health.\n\nThis is what made me pull the trigger on Accutane. I thought back on all the stress and anxiety that I had experienced due to acne. Unnecessary stress and anxiety. Now all of this has made me a stronger person for sure. So in a way I am grateful for it, but I would never wish acne on my strongest enemies. I wish we lived in a world where acne didn\'t exist at all. It\'s pretty fucking stupid if you ask me that it even does exist.\n\nAll the negative emotional effects from acne not only contributed to depression, anxiety and general dis-ease/unhappiness throughout my life, but also caused me to miss out on many life opportunities due to acne crushing my social confidence and throwing off my life momentum.\n\nThere are these chains of events that occur in our life that we can\'t even perceive. It\'s like the Butterfly Effect. Cystic acne pops up causing me to skip classes that day in college, causing me to fail that exam, causing me to have more stress, causing more acne, which causes anxiety so I don\'t get the job interview, causing me to have to take a shittier job, causing me to hate my job and quit and switch to a different career, which means I just wasted 4 years of tuition and schooling on the wrong career, etc)\n\nThe bottomline is none of us have any clue how much acne has limited our success in life. Not to mention instilled mindsets that life is ""out of our control"". There is a saying, ""the easiest way to get depressed is to focus on the things you can\'t control"". Well guess what if you have fucking cystic acne you\'re going to be focused on it a lot, and it is likely you are going to be depressed at some point if you fight with it for 6+ years. That\'s what sucks about acne, it\'s an ongoing battle.\n\nI chose to take Accutane at age 26 out of necessity. I am now going on camera frequently so I basically need it for my career. Having the social confidence to be in front of camera is hard enough WITHOUT unpredictable cystic acne lol. But the real thing that made me pull the trigger is that I realized that the stress + anxiety, as well as a feeling of being unable to maximize my life, all which acne contributes to, is way worse for my overall long-term health than a oral vitamin A-derivative could ever be.\n\nIt\'s also very possible that my extended treatment of minocycline was worse for my overall long-term health than Accutane is!\n\nI don\'t know about you, but I would much rather live a fully maximized, acne-free life and die at age 70, than live to 85 but be depressed because my acne lasted into my 30s or 40s or 50s and I was never able to fully pursue my dreams because I had shattered self-esteem and social confidence (things that are easy to build when I have a consistent appearance). I\'d say the point of life is to reach one\'s full potential as a human, not to simply maximize the number of years you walk the planet while not accomplishing much.\n\nIf you don\'t agree with making the above trade, then maybe Accutane isn\'t for you (although if you deeply meditate on it, you will probably come around and agree with my conclusion!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. If You Are Age 18-22 & Only Have Minor/Moderate Acne, Consider Waiting Until Age 23\n\nI think the perfect time for me to start Accutane would have been age 22/23. Mainly, because I would have been out of college and therefore been able to go throughout the treatment course without drinking heavy amounts of alcohol.\n\nI\'m just calling it like it is. In the USA culture, binge-drinking is commonplace in college-age years (really age 16-22). When you are younger, you are dumb. You think you are invincible, and it is very hard to think about long term health effects when you feel amazing all the time. If I were to take Accutane at age 18 or 19 in college, I wouldn\'t have curtailed my drinking habits very much.\n\nAccutane is a serious drug. The side-effects can be mitigated, but this requires effort. You must be prepared to use a longer skincare routine at least once/day. Mine is currently 8 steps lol.\n\nAccutane already puts a lot of stress on your liver and other organs, I think a lot of the long-term health effects can be avoided if you simply don\'t drink frequently or use any dangerous drugs during your treatment. Also I would highly, highly advise taking a probiotic supplement to help with immune and stomach effects from this drug (also it\'s just a good thing in general to take lots of probiotics during your life, there is pretty much 0 downside to this and it can also help with acne).\n\nBtw, I had about \\~10 alcoholic drinks during my 9 month treatment, and every time I would drink I made sure to skip my pill for that day. Yes, this is not ideal, but I never had more than \\~2 drinks in a given night. Overall, 10 drinks in a 9 month period is very low compared to my college days when 10+ drinks in a night was not uncommon lol.\n\nI personally think that if Accutane can be avoided at these ""younger"" ages, it would be better. The human brain is still heavily developing up until age 25, and I\'m not sure of accutane\'s effects in this area, but I would rather not risk it unless it was necessary. A lower dose could be considered as well, as lower doses are very safe and very effective if you have minor-moderate acne. If you have severe acne, I would just jump on the highest dose and get it over with the right way.\n\nThat being said. If you are age 18-22 & have severe cystic acne, it\'s a no-brainer: get on Accutane asap, and socially isolate yourself for the next 5 months if you have to. It\'s going to be a shitty 5 months, but the time goes by fast. Develop an exercise habit, and sleep a lot lol. Don\'t drink.\n\nIf you are age 18-22 & have moderate cystic acne and you know you can be mature and not drink alcohol. Then, 100% definitely go ahead and take Accutane.\n\nIf you are age 18-22 & have minor cystic acne, think about if you would still have the confidence to do public speaking if you had your cystic acne flare up the night before. If you view it as a minor inconvenience and it is not soul-crushing, consider waiting it out a few years. One thing that might be helpful is to set a realistic date in your calendar and say ""if I\'m still struggling with acne by this date, then I\'m going on Accutane"". Also, if you work a career where you are a performer or are on camera a lot, then definitely do Accutane, at the very least a lower dose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. The Worst Side-Effects Are Brain-Fog/Lack Of Energy + Immune Weakness\n\nThese are the worst side-effects in my opinion. Everyone talks about the dry skin and chapped lips, sore joints, etc. Well, these can be solved fairly easily...\n\nDry skin - Cerave healing ointment every night as your last layer\n\nChapped lips - Dr. Dans + Aquaphor applied 3-5 times per day and your lips are fine.\n\nSore joints - I take 2 Jarrow Krill Oil Pills every morning and this solves it\n\nOn the other hand, brain-fog + immune system weakness are impossible to fully ""solve"".\n\nBrain Fog/Lack Of Energy:\n\nYou must be prepared to not be performing at your highest cognitive potential during the duration of your treatment. Before taking Accutane, I could public speak for 4 hours straight with complete control of an extensive vocabulary. Never really needed to drink much caffeine either. During accutane, at many times I feel ""foggy"" like I\'m kind of drifting through life. Focusing has become much harder, essentially.\n\nI am probably mentally performing at 40-60% of what I know I could perform at. It can be frustrating at times for sure. It is a trade I am willing to make to get rid of acne. Maybe I will update this thread a few months after I am done with Accutane and see if the brain fog has dissipated.\n\nThe best way to help with this is caffeine. If you don\'t currently use caffeine, well you\'re probably going to want to start when on accutane lol. You can also try other stimulants like modafinil, but I personally don\'t like modafinil because it makes me irritable. I personally take 2 caffeine pills every morning to kickstart my day, and then I sip organic black coffee throughout the day as needed. I\'m actually up at 8AM right now writing this after taking my daily caffeine pills in case you were wondering lmao. Supposedly caffeine is considered as a slight cure for depression as it gives you some power to feel you are in control and on top of your life. As mentioned earlier, when you focus on things you are in control of and make progress in accomplishing those things, this generally makes us as humans feel happier :)\n\nA contributor to the lack of energy is dehydration, so I\'d recommend drinking lots of electrolyte water, and consider adding pedialyte to your water as it helps with hydration. I go through about 1-2 bottles of pedialyte per week, and I can\'t really live without it, as I currently live in a very dry + hot climate (very annoying place to be on Accutane in, humidifiers ftw)\n\nSide-Note: While I\'m talking about supplements, another one to consider is collagen as Accutane lowers the collagen levels in your skin. If you want less scarring + more rapid healing, I would take a hefty amount of collagen powder everyday (it\'s also a very healthy form of protein, and I believe it\'s good for joint health as well).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImmune Weakness:\n\nThis could be serious or minor depending on your underlying health conditions. I have a fairly strong immune system in that I rarely get sick. Likely because I\'ve exercised a lot throughout my life, take a shit-ton of health supplements (thanks acne) and take a ton of probiotics (thanks again, acne).\n\nI ended up getting a really bad flu (maybe was COVID) about 2 weeks into my treatment. So, be prepared that you might get sick a few more times than normal during your Accutane treatment. With COVID going around currently, consider if you are ok getting it in exchange for being rid of acne (hopefully a COVID vaccine comes out soon).\n\nI would 100% take probiotic supplements throughout the duration of your treatment. I think it is very dumb that many doctors don\'t recommend this. (most doctors also don\'t tell you to take probiotics while taking antibiotics as well, which is very dumb as it is essentially a no-brainer to replenish good bacteria (probiotics do this) while killing off all bacteria (antiobiotics is like a nuke going off in your gut flora, kills bad and good bacteria)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. Don\'t Worry About An Initial Breakout\n\nThis was something that worried me before starting as well. I just assumed that there was a terrible initial breakout with Accutane like I had with my short-lived Tretinoin experience.\n\nLet me reiterate this. Accutane solves your acne. It\'s pretty much guaranteed. Especially with higher doses. Accutane is the best solution currently available in terms of effectiveness. By far. If you are reading this and haven\'t started yet, it\'s 99% going to work for you and you will literally feel like you are in a waking dream with the fact that your acne is finally ""solved"".\n\nFor me I had very little initial breakout. I had some acne pop up over my first 2-3 months of treatment, but it was nothing worse (in fact far less worse) than the acne I had been experiencing the prior 3 months before treatment.\n\nI would recommend eating clean during the first months of your treatment (no dairy, grains, processed sugar) and definitely wash your face every day, change pillow cases, etc. (for me I had been doing all of this for years before starting Accutane!)\n\nEven if there is a slight initial breakout, Accutane will solve it in the long run, and in my experience I had pretty much 0 initial breakout from Accutane, and this is coming from someone who had a TERRIBLE initial breakout with Topical Tretinoin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. Be Grateful That Accutane Exists\n\nA lot of times in life we are warned that things are ""too good to be true"".\n\nWell, this is definitely true a lot of the time, which is why it is important to research things, and hopefully that is why you are reading this post.\n\nBut, there are quite a few times in life where a thing is simply very good & very true.\n\nAccutane is the solution to acne. It is not particularly dangerous when used with in tandem with a dermatologist and the monthly bloodwork.\n\nI think most of the ""danger"" stigma around it is mainly because of the birth defects it can cause.\n\nDon\'t be a masochist and make yourself go through 3-5 years of struggle like me thinking that I can ""solve"" my cystic acne through the magic alignment of the right supplements, diet, and topical solutions.\n\nCystic acne is a disease. It is not normal. If you have it, it\'s probably not going away anytime soon. I\'m talking YEARS of your life. And this is likely your 20s, the supposed best time of your life! (Elon Musk seems to be proving that one wrong though haha)\n\nCystic acne is not normal people acne, what they (those clearskinned fuckers!) would consider tiny bumps.\n\nI noticed my mom in her 50s even had a cystic acne pop up. That was pretty insane to me when it happened and made me realize that for whatever reason I have acne in my genetics.\n\nOne of the things that made me go for accutane at age 26 (pretty damn old for this shit smh) is that I found out a close friend of mine had gotten on it at 30 years old! And he is now 32 with perfect skin.\n\nI realized that fuck, I easily could be stuck with this acne until age 30, and STILL end up having to take it! That\'s why I decided to write this. If I can convince even 1 person at age 20-22 to take Accutane now rather than delay the inevitable, I\'ve done some good in this world lol.\n\nI\'m grateful for Accutane, even with all its side effects. Grateful as fuck. I will certainly be having my kids take it as well if they show signs of cystic acne. (Unless there is a huge medical advance in acne curing in the next 20-30 years).\n\nAlso, this is just overall life advice, but there ARE amazing opportunities in life. The mindset of ""it\'s too good to be true"" is very limiting. Have the courage to pursue new ideas and make ""small bets"" on things with high upside.\n\nAnyways, I\'m shocked I was able to write this. At the start of Accutane I always was excited to be one of the success stories. Maybe I can share B&A pics at some point in the future, but for now, this is everything I want to share.\n\nHope this helped you, and feel free ask questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr:\n\nStop wasting years of your life battling cystic acne.\n\nJust shut up and swallow these damn Accutane pills.'"

Now that Ive taken my last dose of accutane, I figured Id make a big old post with all the questions I had, my experiences, etc! But first, progress pics, I know why you're here\n\n[Skin progress!

I got my BC for free with a phone appt and that prescription is free. Didnt pay for labs since they were doctor ordered.  \nGenerally: \\~150 in supplies for side effects\n\n  \n**Product Routine: Less is more!**\n\nAM/PM- Mario Badescu spray, Neutrogena hydroboost gel cream  \n\n\n**Products:**\n\n**HG, die without:**\n\nMario Badescu rose & aloe spray\n\nNeutrogena hydroboost GEL CREAM (for extra dry skin)\n\n1% hydrocortisone cream- great for corner of lips\n\n  \n**Helpfuls:**\n\nAyr saline nasal gel with aloe- dry nose\n\nSystane balance- mild eye dryness\n\nSystane gel drops- longer lasting relief\n\nHydrocolloid bandages- overnight on recently broken whiteheads (Ie within a few minutes of breaking)  \n\n\n**Chapsticks:**\n\nChapstick medicated- 9/10, odd smell\n\nBooda Butter- 8/10, needs a lot of reapplication, light and matte\n\nAquaphor- 5/10, good for extreme dryness, bad taste, shiny, doesnt stay on lips\n\nChap-lip lip balm- 10/10, cheap knock off, works as well/ better than chapstick, and tastes better\n\nVaseline lip balm- 7/10, does alright, dont like tintVaseline- 7/10, layered over aquaphor overnight, wears off, does an ok job\n\n  \n**Hated Its:**\n\nCerave Hydrating Cleanser- stopped after a few days, burns my skin on accutane\n\nAquaphor (tub)- too thick for face, didnt keep with it\n\nNeutrogena oil free sunscreen- white cast, pilling, sweat turns it white, began to burn after a while.\n\nNeutrogena hydroboost WATER GEL- heavily perfumed, doesnt hydrate as well  \n\n\n**Other product issues:**\n\nCerave cleanser bar/Cerave PM Moisturizer (With niacinamide) These both caused my skin to flip out and break out into closed comedones in month 5. Stopped after 4 days and returned to older routine.  \n\n\n**Side effects, when and how I handled them:**\n\n  \n**Chapped lips**\\- within week 1, any chapstick you can find (menthol kinda burns though), remove dry skin by gently exfoliating with sugar and olive oil Cracked lip corners- hydrocortisone 1% solves it overnight  \n**Dry skin**\\- within 2 weeks, moisturize with oil free, non comedogenic moisturizers on face, whatever on body  \n**Baby purge**\\- 2 weeks, a couple new breakouts mostly around my mouth. Once burst, put a hydrocolloid on overnight, purge was done in 10 days  \n**Old rashes popped back up**\\- 1 month- I think due to skin being thinner old rashes came back, treated easily with athletes foot cream  \n**Scrapes and cuts**\\- Im clumsy and trip while running- keep wet with neosporin as long as possible, do not let scab  \n**Sunburns/tans**\\- moisturize, try to avoid  \n**Sore lower back**\\- around 2 months, ibuprofen (From running, I was doing 10ks, that was too much, 5ks are fine)  \n**Headaches**\\- 3 months, minor and infrequent, treated with Ibuprofen  \n**Dry eyes**\\- 3 months, Systane balance was good for mild dryness, the summer sun pushed me to systane gel drops, but only needed eye drops a handful of times  \n**Dry nose**\\- 3 months- alternates from being dry and congested to runny. Ayr and drinking water help a little, but not annoying enough to do much else  \n**Flushing**\\- 3 months on, skin just turns red easily, cheeks are always pink. Didnt treat because I dont really mind it as much. My skin tone normally never flushes so its a fun change for me. Niacinamide is touted as a solution though  \n**Loose hair**\\- 3 months on, not sure if due to accutane or just not showering every other day. Still have plenty of hair  \n**Drowsiness after taking pills**\\- \\~4 months, noticed Id be drowsy after taking pills, usually just napped for like 20 minutes  \n\n\n**Fun bonus side effect!** I found my cheekbones became much more pronounced on accutane, possibly due to no longer having as much underlying inflammation. Now my entire face shape has changed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n**General tips:**\n\n1. Drink more water/ fluids in general\n2. YES you HAVE TO take it with 20 g of fat (Peanut butter was my go to on toast)\n   1. Also, peanuts, macadamia nuts, avocado, french fries, ice cream lmao\n3. NO you CANNOT wax/get a tattoo/suntan/dermaroll/ break or stress your skin in any way, I dont care how low your daily dose is or how mild the side effects\n4. STOP all other products with actives- antibiotics, topicals etc.\n5. Dont use oil based moisturizers of your face, your body is fine\n6. You can drink, but dont black out or do it every day\n7. Ibuprofen is your friend, not aspirin\n8. If you get constant headaches, call your derm immediately\n9. Keep injuries like scrapes or cuts moist with neosporin while they heal- it does take longer than usual, but they scar easier too\n\nSo, as you can see, month 3 was a fun month for me side effect wise, but I pushed through, because thats when my skin was getting REALLY clear and the scars were nearly gone. I did have one or two very small bumps that never fully surfaced up to month 4, month 5 was clear. I ended up above the 120 mg/kg because there was a few months between my initial appointment with a weigh in and when I started the drug, so Id already lost weight between then.  \n\n\n***Do I recommend Accutane?*****Yes**, but with caveats- in my time on this sub, Ive seen people complaining of severe side effects and lasting damage that may be from accutane (a lot of stunted growth) and the common denominator was that they were boys whod taken accutane as teenagers (AS YOUNG AS 14 WTF) and while my acne was worse as a teenager and could have benefitted from accutane then, Im glad I took it after puberty and urge teenagers on this sub exploring accutane to consider the same.  \nIn my imgur album I included some pictures of me as a teen/preteen and my entire face was a zit. I would get headaxches from the pressure and the pain, and nobody in my family believed how much I was suffering. So I understand, a lot of people here will understand. We just dont know exactly what accutane is doing in the body in every tissue at every age.  \nSevere acne sucks, I really do know. But the cost credible severe side effect Ive seen with accutane is stunting growth in pubescent boys.  \nSo i recommend it to people post puberty who have tried several other options."""

Eventually it started getting worse and I developed a slight red bump inside the butt crack and as well as outer. (If photo is needed for medical use I can put one up). Eventually, I was able to lay down and walking was alright but whenever I would sit for example to drive I would get this stinging pain and when I would try to get up. After that, I took a medication prescribed by my doctor called meloxicam. Its helped a lot and now Im able to lay down and mostly sit.

I am located in Minnesota and will absolutely take a recommendation on a professional to see.\n\nOver the past few weeks I have seen 8 or 9 different doctors between the emergency room, my GP, a OBGYN, breast specialist, nurses, a PA and a dermatologist, I even saw a hematologist due to unusual blood work. No one knows what is wrong with me, how to diagnose me or how to treat me. But they all agree something is very wrong. Originally they thought Lupus and then the ER said vasculitis.

Blood vessels are bursting and I experience swelling and pain with this. \n\n-vulva swelling with distended veins.\n\n-I have problems with spikes in blood pressure and heart rate that cant be explained and I was often told it is anxiety.

It is usually self limiting to hours and they dont have a known trigger.\n\n-my hands swell and turn red and purple if I get too warm or too upset.\n\n-I dont sweat anymore. Being hot makes me feel very sick and my face turns bright red. My skin feels like it is burning. It takes multiple ice packs and hours in front of an air conditioner to cool down to a regular temperature.\n\n-I get stretches of unexplained chest pains.

barbiturate,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/4jj37d/facing_a_bipolar_diagnosis_and_i_am_struggling/,b'Facing a bipolar diagnosis and I am struggling',,"b'I was diagnosed with depression in December 2010, and I have taken a multitude of anti-depressants since then, some effective, some less so - some effective for the first month or three then a major crash, blahblahblah. A list of antidepressants I have been prescribed includes (but may not be limited to the following, I have memory problems) fluoxetine, citalopram, mirtazapine, amitriptyline and sertraline. A doctor once considered venlafaxine but I went for the sertraline instead.\n\nAnyway, I don\'t want to have a huge post so I will try to cut short. My original December 2010 diagnosis was just ""depression"" and then after a few years and multiple different ADs my doctor just said I was suffering from resistant Major Depressive Disorder (i.e. not situational, not going away by itself or with the use of first line drugs). I was offered counselling, I agreed to go - unfortunately I was not told it was a group conselling programme like AA or NA and that was not something I felt comfortable with at the time. I was younger, more anxious and I couldn\'t face it, so I didn\'t go after all.\n\nIn August 2010 I had a weird experience where I became randomly, out of nowhere, excitable, motivated, yet utterly depressed still. I was agitated if I kept still, I could not stay in the house for longer than 30 minutes - I had to keep moving, keep busy. I walked about 7 miles every day and spent around 12 hours outside, alone, from 10am until around 10pm. Doing nothing in particular, I just had to keep moving - when I did, I felt free, I could breathe, I was content and things were good. But when I stopped or sat still, I wanted to kill myself.\n\nI went to my GP as this was not an experience I have had before, thinking it may be a hypomanic or manic state - I know that bipolar is usually misdiagnosed for years. Anyway, she was worried, I had not slept for 3 days, so she referred me to the Community Mental Health Team (CMHT). She gave me diazepam to help me sleep. They didn\'t work.\n\nI was assessed at the CMHT and was deemed low priority due to my diagnosis being ""just"" MDD, and they said they didn\'t think it was a hypomanic or manic state as although there was agitation, no sleep, needing to keep busy etc. my mood was actually low and depressive. Fair enough. So I received almost a year\'s worth of CBT from them rather than any other programs or treatments.\n\nJanuary 2015 I overdosed on barbirurates and benzodiazepines after my boyfriend broke up with me. It was not a suicide attempt, and I am so thankful that I lived, but also that people UNDERSTOOD that it wasn\'t a suicide attempt. It had been around 5+ days since the break up, I was still sad over it, but getting better. The problem was I could not get any sleep at all... after 4 or 5 days of no sleep, you become stupid and reckless. That is how I overdosed on the barbiturates and benzodiazepines. It helped that I had lots of both available and it was obvious that I hadn\'t taken even say 30% of them, whereas apparently people with suicidal intentions take the whole lot. So that was on my side. I didn\'t die, I was OK.\n\nThere have been numerous ups and downs since January 2015, but skip to January 2016. I has been feeling increasingly low since November 2015 and it was getting too much. I was prescribed propranolol for anxiety (benzos were sort of avoided because... well, the above), and my sertraline was raised to 150mg.\n\nAnd it felt fantastic. I had a solid 3 weeks of feeling amazing. My mood was great, I felt the best I had in over a year, I was so motivated, I wasn\'t doing just my own job at work but doing extra work. Fantastic. But two coworkers noticed this sudden change in my behaviour and spoke to our manager saying they were worried about my behaviour and personality change. \n\nMy manager who is a pharmacist suggested it was me probably just getting used to the drugs after the increase. So we gave it a few weeks. The happiness and everything was good, I just kept trying to be less excitable/loud etc. at work so people would not complain.\n\nThen in March/April... major crash. I was having neurological symptoms such as major memory loss and confusion, sleeping for 16 hours in weird places and at weird times... I got an MRI scan and an urgent referral to a neurologist.\n\nThe neurologist has sort of cleared me, he said I have a sleep disorder called REM behaviour disorder meaning I sleepwalk/talk/act and basically I was so tired all the time and sleeping for so long because my ""sleep"" wasn\'t actually restful or refreshing. I was spending too long in REM sleep and my body was acting my dreams out. Spending too long in REM means skipping sleep stages as well which is apparently why I was unable to remember things from the day before... my brain hadn\'t had chance to process them overnight.\n\nLong story short, he wants to prescribe clonazepam for the REM behaviour disorder. But obviously after the January 2015 overdose we have a potential issue there. He said it should be fine, once I spoke candidly about the context of it all, the fact it wasn\'t to get high or suicidal, just a desperate need for sleep, and suggested that we could just do prescriptions for 10 nights at a time for the first few months, if it made me feel better/safer. I thought it was nice how he didn\'t just say ""hell no"" to the clonazepam; in fact it was his suggestion and he basically said there is no other pill we can give you that will work as well for a parasomnia like this. He said I must avoid the three Z sleep drugs cos they can make it worse, and he wants one that will make me sleepy, reduce my REM sleep (I am jumping straight in to REM, so a drug that reduces REM is actually a good thing for me in this situation even though it is a bad thing generally), one that will keep my muscles relaxed (to reduce the likelihood of acting out my dreams and sleepwalking etc.) and one that isn\'t too long-acting like diazepam because I do actually work when I am not on sick leave and any drug needs to be compatible with a normal work life. He also said whilst diazepam is a great muscle relaxer it takes too long to take effect and lasts too long. So clonazepam it is.\n\nBut then at the end, he said we need to get to the root cause of my REM Behaviour Disorder, particularly because it is sort of new and only started a month or 2 ago. I told him about the complaints at work in January, I told him about August 2014... he knew I was depressed, I asked if that could have an impact, he said yes.\n\nThen he said, as well as a neurologist, I am actually qualified in Psychiatry as well, and I am able to work as a Psychiatrist as of 3 years ago. So I am like - this is brilliant, killing two birds with one stone.\n\nThen he says it... ""I think, quite probably, that you have bipolar disorder"". And I have thought it was possible before... In August 2014.... In January 2016............ but I\'m usually so low all the time, I never seem to have any huge manic periods or hypomanic incidents. But he said I was thinking about it too much and had been biased over what I know about bipolar (I teach Psychology) and how I probably think of it as the extremes. He asked if I looked it up before, I said yes loads of times for both personal reasons and work reasons. And I listed all the symptoms I don\'t have... and he was like yes, but the ones that you do have are the most important ones.\n\nSo. Because he saw me that day as a neurologist rather than a Psychiatrist, he would like me to see a second Psychiatrist for a second opinion and formal diagnosis (even though he is qualified, that is not what he was working/employed for at the hospital I saw him at). He said not to worry and how it is a good thing as after 7 years I may finally get things sorted. I cried and said that\'s all I want, to get things sorted. I felt relieved. He said forget the stigma, forget what you read, see or hear, just go see this second Psychiatrist when I get the appointment, and if I am diagnosed with bipolar we can work something out between me and the Psychiatrist and how it will be much better in the long run. I spend 90% of my time depressed and 10% of my time super happy and motivated, but also anxious about when it ends. To have an antidepressant that works would be fantastic and for one to work for longer than a few weeks or months (I always thought that was just the time it took my body to get used to it - turns out it was probably just hypomania from the SSRIs as I was obviously not on a mood stabiliser or anything else) would be a great bonus. I left the hospital feeling relieved but slightly anxious.\n\nThat was 5 days ago. Now my mood is in the gutter, I just feel like crying, and I am so depressed I just want to sleep forever. I will obviously not take anything extra to help with that due to... the reasons previously highlighted. But that is how I feel, really depressed, anxious, tired. I just want to sleep for a week or 3.\n\nSo I don\'t really know what this post is about. I am sorry it is probably just a useless wall of text. I guess I am just facing a potential, more than likely than not, bipolar diagnosis and it feels like a whole new world. Some good, some bad - the goods being I might get better treatment tailored for the condition rather than just having SSRIs thrown at me, the bad being... well, having bipolar.\n\nI know depression is tough. I know bipolar is tough. I know it won\'t be easy. But if anyone would be as kind as to share their stories about how they got diagnosed, what happened immediately afterwards in terms of medication and treatment, and whether you feel better in the long term after being diagnosed. I guess my biggest worry is if I am diagnosed, but if things don\'t get better. If I get the right diagnosis, and the right treatment and things still don\'t start getting better... that is what I am worried about. At the moment I have hope, but also anxiety. Because I really want to feel better. And I don\'t want the label and stigma that comes with being diagnosed as bipolar, if I actually don\'t feel any better for it, if that makes sense?\n\nSorry this is so long. It is almost 3AM here in the UK.\n\nThank you. '"

I actually had appointments that I've cancelled from the parking lot and have paid cancellation fees because I'm shaking and horrified to walk in, I had a VERY bad pediatric dentist).  I know I was pre-periodontal at that point and definitely likely have it now. I brush religiously and have a Waterpik I use. \nI finally decided that enough was enough and my smile means more to me than an hour or two of anxiety. I had an appointment scheduled for march 31st that was cancelled due to lockdown and in the past two weeks my dental health has drastically declined. \n\nI have epilepsy (diagnosed in 2018) and am on keppra. I still have frequent breakthrough seizures and I swear EVERYTIME i have one, my bite changes. In addition my medication makes my mouth dry and I think I'm experiencing receding gums (I can see more of my teeth and my gums bleed everytime I brush). \n\nI also have severe bruxism (stress lol) and even though I wear a nice sleep dental guard, it's not getting better. My teeth are sharp, and I have permanent scarring on my cheek and tongue:( I think my gums would be swollen if there was enough of them left to swell. It definitely feels like theres sores in my mouth and I cant eat the same stuff I used to. \n\nWell today as I was using the waterpik I noticed I now have a very obvious cavity in the middle side of one of my back molars. Not where it meets another tooth, just in the side. I have NO idea how it got there, I literally am OBSESSED with my dental health, it's quite literally all I think about (constantly reminding myself: lips closed, teeth apart) I can see some tarter build up on my bottom front teeth, and am planning on getting some sort of tool to try and clean up what I can, but I'm worried about bleeding. The backside of my lower left canine has a filling and  its grinded so far down, it's almost even with my gum line. Everytime I touch it with my tongue it feels WEIRD. \n\nAny suggestions on how to keep this situation from getting any worse until I can get in to see someone? I deeply regret not just going in for regular checkups. I was in college at the time and that just exacerbated my anxiety.

It began around 8 months ago which is the same time I started weening off of my Escitalopram (Lexapro) after 4 years. After the first 4 months of not being able to clear it up, I went to the Dr and they prescribed me an antibiotic called Doxycycline which did not help. At that same time they gave me prescription for topical Benzoyl Peroxide and Clindamycin. About a month later they then prescribed me Spironolactone (first 25mg, now 50mg) around the same time I took my last Lexapro pill as well as a topical Tretinoin. It has now been a little over 2 months on Spironolactone, & no Lexapro, I still use the Benzoyl Peroxide & Clindamycin in the morning and Tretinoin in the evening, and I do think it's a little bit better but I'm still getting new pimples at least every other day. I also want to add that I've smoked weed consistently for about 4 years now and have pretty much stopped drinking entirely (unless it's free lol, in that case I'll have 1-2 drinks very randomly). I haven't done keto or whole 30 but I typically eat pretty clean. I have a feeling it's either the stopping of lexapro or the consistent weed smoking but my Dr says there is no research to determine if either of those is true. I am thinking about going on Accutane but am a bit nervous of the symptoms & it increasing depression now that I am off of the Lexapro. Have also thought about just getting back on the Lexapro if it will make the acne go away. Anyone else experience cystic acne after stopping Lexapro or smoking consistently for a few years?

They all feel very much the same and also never really change over the weeks and months, even with dose adjustments.\n\nZoloft and Lexapro feel very similar, and are the only ones that don't make me feel a LOT worse. They both just make me feel a bit lightheaded and slightly nauseous on the first day and then not much after that. There will either be a very slight increase or decrease in my usual level of irritability which will revert to normal after 1-2 days. Then I pretty much feel nothing apart from an overall reduction in my irritability by maybe 10%. That's as good as it gets. Zoloft also tends to make my insomnia and OCD motor tics a bit worse.\n\nProzac and Trintellix felt the same, except Prozac was way worse and more intense. Day 1 felt uneasy and extra irritable. The next 2-3 weeks felt even worse, with my pre-existing feelings of constant dread and sense of impending doom much worse. Occasional worsening of my insomnia. After about a month, my nervous tension and social anxiety increased dramatically and my lifelong stutter came back (it had been much improved by taking Klonopin for the last 6 years). Weeks 5-8 just felt like a nightmare of constant worsening of dread, like something horrible was going to happen. After 2 months, I couldn't sleep at all and had to stop taking it. I had been taking an antihistamine every night for 6 years to sleep and never had a problem until now. The Prozac was just overriding both the Klonopin and the antihistamine. I stopped abruptly with no side effects except some feelings of relief. It took me a month before I could sleep decently again, despite doubling my dosage of antihistamine. It was also the first time in 6 years that I felt the need to take extra Klonopin, just to relieve the extra anxiety.\n\nEffexor felt similar, except it didn't give me insomnia. It hugely worsened my sense of impending doom and constant dread though. After about 3 months I had to go off it as I just felt so miserable and paralysed by anxiety, I couldn't even deal with the 10 minute walk to my doctor to get more or try something else. I abruptly went off it and felt no side effects except relief.\n\nCymbalta felt similar once again, except for the first week it felt more like Zoloft or Lexapro. Very mild. Then I started to notice after week 2-3, that all too familiar feeling of worsening dread. Everything felt very dark and hopeless. Nothing brought comfort or relief except sleep. After week 4 I felt extra irritable and angry. SO sick of feeling so bad basically. I went off it, again abruptly, and again with no side effects.\n\nIn between each, I would go back to either Zoloft or Lexapro, just because they were slightly better than nothing.\n\nThe other one I tried was Moclobemide, which didn't make me feel worse thankfully, but instead felt like nothing. No difference, except excessive sleepiness. I kept falling asleep an hour after each pill, so twice a day, for hours, and that went on for about a month with no benefits, so I had to go off it.\n\nOther than that, I was on Lamictal for months, alongside both Effexor and then Zoloft, which felt like literally taking nothing. Only after my dose got up to 150mg did I feel extra apathetic and dull, sleepy, as well as cognitively slow. I'd lose words, or use the wrong word, etc. After I stopped taking it, my mind remained slow for about 3 months afterwards.\n\nI was prescribed Seroquel for sleep and anxiety, but it was horrible and made me so tense and wired, irritable and wide awake that I couldn't sleep at all!\n\nThe same thing happens with things like Benadryl, Hydroxyzine and Ashwagandha.\n\nI tried Ritalin for apparent ADHD, but again, it felt TERRIBLE, made my body ultra tense and exhausted at the same time, and my mind so tired, bored, dull and depressive that all I could do was lay on the couch staring into space. I couldn't focus on anything and couldn't read or write properly. I kept skipping words. That was a dose of only 5mg and 10mg.

At one point, I thought it might be KP (which I have on my arms), so I tried light exfoliation with a washcloth and it started itching really bad.

He did echo, carotid ultrasound, EKG, week monitor, and chest ct without contrast, no valve regurg, everything on CT was unremarkable or no lesions present (aorta, upper abdomen, lungs, bones) BUT he saw heterogenous thyroid. Went for US and they found about nine nodules. Recommended biopsy for one due to size but endo says he believes its a cyst but did FNA due to size. Waiting on that. He also did a series of blood tests and noticed I had low vitamin D but said because of my tsh/t4 being normal and my PTH and phosphorus being normal he doesnt think thyroid is causing symptoms. (I thought maybe I had hyperthyroidism)\n\n\nHeres where it gets a little weird on two accounts:\n\nPart 1:\nIm not a conspiracy theorist in anyway, but all this started happening after my second Covid shot. So that was one theory I had that maybe Im just one of the unlucky few. I had Covid too (before the shots) but besides a cough and the worlds worst headache I was pretty okay. \n\nI got the shot in June and symptoms started late June early July. \n\nHeres where its weird part 2: \nI was never tested for STDs even though I thought I was. I thought my doctor screened me at every blood test. Im also not sexually active outside of relationships but I had an ex (10 years ago) who REALLY wasnt honest and I got a pretty weird sore throat that made my tonsils touch while dating her, responded to cefixime, not to zpack, my mom took me to hospital and they thought I had mono and shot me with steroids. Which made me WORSE. I told them no way cuz antibiotics were working. Turns out I didnt have mono (did have igg for ebv though) after the steroids I had a peeling hand rash like blisters and really bad mouth pain that I assumed was a side effect of IV methyl prednisone. When I saw my PCP after he said Its not mono we checked you for everything its probably a virus to which I also disagreed but I was 22 at the time. Also when he said everything, I thought he meant stds too. It took me a while to feel better/tonsils to go down.  \n\nSo now ten years later, I freaked about the symptoms I had back then(hand rash, mouth pain, sore throat, and I had dry flaky skin around genitalia and a raised round rash/welt on side of scrotum at the time that I thought was eczema or jock itch) and ran to an ID doctor cuz I thought it could have been syphilis. He did full panel negative for all STIs twice just to make sure  (didnt test for herpes) Including FTA ABS, then he did a TPPA I had two rpr and also two reverse screens (one from labcorp one from quest) all now (ten years later, not back then) that Im worried are pulling false negatives due to length of time/waning antibodies and the fact that I basically was drinking heavily out of anxiety during those months October to December. Im talking like four or five drinks a day sometimes (I would stop a day or two before the tests, but I drank whiskey the day before the FTA ABS test) Im worried the antigen specific antibodies went down. ID doctor wouldnt treat me unless I came back positive.\n\nSwitched PCPs, this one heard me out a little better and prescribed me doxy 100mg x 2 for 28 days because he could see I was visibly worried. (No penicillin allergy but he didnt want to give me the shot yet since I keep testing negative and maybe it is something else) so I cut the drinking out since I started the doxy (I had like one beer that I split in half, and another day I had a little glass of sake but Im abstaining for the doxy to really work)\nHe did urine culture and dipstick test both normal. (No microanalysis)\n\nEye pain stopped after doxy I noticed, also high albumin dropped from 5.5 to 4.8\n\nOn one hand im worried Im having some wild vaccine reaction\n\non the other hand, Im worried I might have syphilis/neurosyphilis from ten years ago which is causing the eye pain, floaters, twitching, ect. I hope god forbid the doxy would be enough to stop further damage. \n\nIf not that, then maybe some other bacterial infection that wasnt treated right. Or Covid/Covid shot side effects.\n\nCould the alcohol really have messed my std tests up/ should I retest after the doxy/a month of not drinking\n\nCan anyone recommend any other tests or something else to look into.

I have never been super sensitive to the sun, except maybe my eye-lids and upper lip lol. I rarely burn. That being said I was aware of the increased sensitivity with both medications. I didn't notice a huge difference with the Tretinoin, merhaps because my moisturizer had SPF.\n\n\n\n- After I started taking the Doxy I noticed that when I was out in the sun my skin everywhere would feel tingly and get warm which freaked me out bc I had never reacted to the sun like that. I work outside 75% of the work week, so I started taking precautions including wearing hats. I guess it didn't work because [a few days ago](https://imgur.com/a/1EVHF1G), small red itchy dots started showing up on my chest, neck and weird texture on my chin and forehead.

The only thing that helps me do so is Lorazepam but the doctors dont want to give me any more.\n\nI fully understand and have educated myself on the long-term side affects but have yet to notice any cause for concern. Even as far as immediate side affects go, I occasionally get drowsy after taking it but not sure if thats the lorazepam or just the mental/emotional toll of leaving my house. \n\nI was prescribed it by a doctor who was happy for me to be on it and agreed that anti-depressants were not the way to go. Theyve never worked previously and I dont have depression.\n\nWell a couple of months ago (Id been on lorazepam for about 5 months, I want to say), I asked for some more medication and was told no. During this 5 months, not once was I asked how I was doing, how the medication was impacting me, any side affects, etc. I was simply being given it and then told no. The only thing I take Lorazepam for is to get to imperative appointments. Meaning that if I have 3 appointments in a month, Ill take Lorazepam 3 times in that month. If i have 1 appointment in a month, Ill take lorazepam once in that month, etc. Hy appointments I mean doctors appointments, e.g. check ups, blood tests, cervical screenings, etc.\n\nThe benefits significantly outweigh the side affects because Im currently not experiencing any. It allows me to leave my house and go to see doctors in person. Recently, Ive had to rely on seeing them over the phone. I was told to go in for an EKG and couldnt.\n\nI have toothache but cant see a dentist. I have severe psoriasis and finally got a call saying they have an appointment for me but I had to cancel it. My partner and I have to move soon and if the move requires more than a 2 minute drive, I cant leave. I have gynaecological issues going on and been referred, havent gotten an appointment date but I wont be able to go to that either.  \n\nI have so many things I need to get sorted but cant.\n\nHow do I make the doctors understand this?\n\nI struggled with something similar back when I was 15-16 and my doctor happily allowed me to take Diazepam whenever I needed it. I wasnt forced to ration it or made to feel dirty for asking for more. I was given 28 at a time, whereas they only give me 7 lorazepam at a time. He monitored me, checked in, asked how they were helping me, what I was using them for, etc. Eventually I came off of them because I no longer needed them. I never had to increase my dose or experienced any side affects. I was taking them for almost a year. \n\nThe doctors have since prescribed me Mirtazapine. I knew that this would do nothing for my acute anxiety or help me leave the house but I took it anyway because I felt forced. I was also given promethazine but again, it doesnt seem to help. \n\nMy psoriasis is getting worse, my teeth are getting worse, my anxiety is getting worse because I feel the one thing I can count on to help me leave the house is no longer accessible. I dont know what to do.\n\nSurely I have some say and choice in this? Ive not experienced any withdrawal or noticed any tolerance build up (2mg is my magic number and its remained just as effective the entire 5 months, no need to increase my dose - even if I did need to, I wouldnt because I have a severe phobia of vomiting and would be terrified that 3mg could end up making me sick. 2mg feels safe). \n\nIve been made to feel like some kind of drug addict for asking for it. I feel dirty and guilty but I just want to know that if I need to go to an appointment, I can. Same as if someone gets car sick and needs anti-sickness tablets on a car journey. I need lorazepam to go to appointments. \n\nIve expressed Im more than happy to have weekly calls, be monitored, provide proof of appointments and when/how Im taking the medication. What else can I do? \n\nIm incredibly open to trying other medications but I want to know that until I find something else that works, or until I get better, Ill be able to have access to lorazepam for when its imperative that I get somewhere. \n\nI also understand that exposure is important and I cant rely on them forever but I have so much going on right now that needs to get sorted and is causing me overwhelming stress and anxiety, that I just need the extra help and knowing I have something to rely on. When Ive got my psoriasis sorted, teeth sorted, know where Im going to live etc, Ill feel much more prepared to try things without medication. But with my psoriasis for example. Ive been waiting for MONTHS for this appointment. If I go without Lorazepam, freak out and leave, Ive now missed out and who knows how long Ill have to wait again. I cant even shower, my hands are raw and my nails are falling off. Its not something I can just chance, like going to the shop. If I go to the shop and have to leave, no big deal. But appointments, I have to see it through and lorazepam is the only thing that guarantees I can.\n\nI totally understand that if I was showing signs of addiction or tolerance build up or any negative long term side affects but the doctors havent even seen me or asked me any questions so I dont understand taking me off of it when Im only using it a couple of times a month for appointments.\n\nHow do I convey this to the doctor?'"

Like food allergies, people can overcome their allergies to penicillin antibiotics. According to them, 80% of people who were allergic to penicillin recovered from their allergy after about 10 years. \n\nWide use of broad-spectrum antibiotics has led to a greater chance of antibiotic resistance and the potential to create superbugs (strains of bacteria that are resistant to most antibiotics). \n\nAlso, the broad spectrum antibiotics kill a wide range of bacteria which sounds great, but when we say ""a broad range"", we also include the good bacteria that are responsible for our healthy gut.

But on hindsight, I do think I also have BP issues because it runs in the family and my anxiety simply worsens it.\n\nLong story short: Here in our country, the vax procedure requires you to have a stable BP. So they take your vitals before injecting you. I\'ve dreaded this day for months ever since I found out they take your BP prior to vaccination\n\nThe nurse took my temperature and oxygen levels (which were fine) but my pulse rate (they used the device on the finger) and registered at 122! I was very uncomfortable especially during the wait as I see people getting deferred because of high BP ahead of me. I felt pressured to give a stable BP. And lo and behold my first reading was 170/100!\n\nI tried to look calm but deep inside I just wanted to die of the embarassment. The nurse said I was very nervous and set me aside to ""calm myself down"" and after 15 mins, my BP was 160/100 (I was still feeling anxious and uneasy).\n\nNurse referred me to the doctor whom I told about my anxiety and told me to calm down. He said I looked and talked very nervous and gave me this anti-hypertensive med which you put under the tongue. After 10 mins, they took my BP and said it was 140/90 and was already good enough. I know it\'s still high but the moment they said I\'m ok to be injected, I immediately felt a wave of calmness and relief.\n\nAnyway, as someone who suffers from health anxiety, I can\'t help but obsess over these numbers. I cannot bring myself to even measure my BP at home because I will drive myself nuts as I will obsess over the results. I want to but I don\'t know where to start.\n\nI\'m going to a cardiologist next Monday to help me with this and maybe it is about time to finally confront my issue so I can be given proper meds.\n\nCan someone please extend me some success stories with regards to BP or any good stuff while I wait for my appointment?

My adventures to get treatment have been.. eye-opening. I'd like to have some input from any lurking physicians in here, if any.\n\nI'm 24, I've been symptomatic for almost 10 years now, my condition greatly worsening around 4 years ago. I have been on 'temporary disability' for 5 years, I am unable to work or study, I haven't even finished high school. Basically, after sleeping for couple of days (20-40 hours with some hours spent up in between) I have few days when I can keep up my concentration and my physical condition before terribad fatigue and tiredness sets in - basically a mixture of chronic fatigue syndrome and idiopathic hypersomnia. Needless to say, I don't really have much social contact IRL\n\nDespite this, I've had 4 doctors tell me they couldn't do anything for me; they would not prescribe any stimulants or other meds that could help. At some point I was able to get a prescription for modafinil, which helps me immensely, but I still have trouble with concentration and hypersomnolence. I can study (stuff like physiology) by myself for 2-6 hours, on good days, but that's it. I like to jog when I can but that's usually limited to maximum of 2 times /week because my performance goes so low, similar to athletes with overtraining syndrome. Actually, even then it seems to sloooowly build up and force me to rest (i.e no physical exercise)\n\nI had a polysomnograph done with no evidence of sleep apnea or other disorders. Total sleep time was 550 minutes: S1 17%, S2 46%, S3 10%, S4 13% SREM 15%. AHI 2.2/hour, PLM index 12/hour. Now, the SREM was very low, which I expected, and the physician scoring it explains this with my venlafaxine (300mg/d) I am on, and I agree with her. Other physician (neurologist) thinks it's very abnormal and definitely not explained fully by the medication. I can't find any support for this in Pubmed/Google papers. Anyway, he wanted to keep observing my situation, despite the fact that I have been on 400-600mg of modafinil for 2 years and still unable to work or go to school. I pushed him to GTFO and he caved in and prescribed me 36mg of Concerta per day.\n\nSad thing is.. I don't notice really anything. Slight headache and tremor at times, that's it. Today I took my usual 400mg modafinil with 36mg Concerta, 3 hours later I crushed a 18mg pill to test if that has any effect, but I still had to take a 3-hour nap in middle of the day (7 hours after modafinil dose). I do feel a tiny bit more alert but really, this is it? This shit was so hard to get and it does nothing? \n\nI'd like to test dextroamphetamine but I strongly think the current doc won't prescribe it, seeing how reluctant he was with Concerta. I don't understand how doctors can abandon patients like me, even though there exists drugs that can work. They have nothing to lose but I've already lost almost everything. I don't drink alcohol or smoke at all and my relatives don't have any history of drug abuse. I'm motivated to go to school and help others. Yet, it's as if I have to fight for every treatment to get it. \n\nI don't seriously understand this. Physicians of reddit, please share your thoughts."""

It\'s either they don\'t believe you, or think you\'re a junky trying to get high on pain meds or that you\'re lying about the amount of narcotics your doctor administers for break\n\nYears ago, I had an older physician Dr. B, who was part of a cancer practice group. He was amazing, the best part was he actually listened to me. It honestly felt like a partnership. I saw him for close to 10 years, and because it was a cancer treatment facility, when I got flare ups, I went in and was prescribed/administered IV pain meds and fluids.\nAs Dr. B was older, he finally decided to retire in order to spend more time with his family.\nWhen he did retire he referred me to a new doctor who joined the practice. Dr. S.\n\nRight off the bat, on our first meeting she was immediately combative, she went on a diatribe about my pain meds and how she\'s strict about them. She immediately made me sign a pain management contract and stated if I ever broke the contract I was out.\n\nThe first time I had my crisis, and came to the infusion center, she cut my prescription from 6mg to 4. Not a big deal, but now most times I have to go in 2-3 days to get my pain under control rather than the 1 day before.\n\nThen we had a discussion about a drug Hydra. I mentioned that Dr. B had me on it, it caused me to get sick more frequently and eventually caused me to almost die in the ICU. I was going into sepsis from toxicity from that particular medication.\n\nShe didn\'t care, wanted me on it. I tried to argue my case but she never listened. So, I decided I just won\'t pick up the prescription from the pharmacy.\nEventually she found out I wasn\'t taken the meds (blood tests), I reluctantly agreed to start taking them.\n\nWell my previous experience is repeating itself, I\'m having more frequent crisis, almost every other week.\nThe last time I went into the infusion center for pain management, the drugs were cut again, this time from 4mg to 2.\nI talked 4mg Dilaudid orally, which as I understand it, the bioavailability comes down to 2. So wondering why she\'did prescribe 2mg when I\'ve done 2mg every 3 hours at home didn\'t help.\nAnyway, talked to the administering Nurse and was told ""well you\'ll get a second dose later so it\'s the same thing"". This came from Dr. S.\n\nWith my crisis getting more frequent and having this, I pretty much stopped going to the infusion center. It\'s all the inconvenience of getting there, getting a ride to come back, without actually relieving my pain, seems like I\'m just as well taking the same dose at home.\n\nThis brings us to today, she had me stop the hydrea to try a new medication, an infusion of crizanlizumab.\n\nThis triggered a bad flare up, my pain was at a 9 in my joints and back, my face was flush. My bp which is normally 110/60 jumped to 155/70.\nThe nurses gave me benedryl, and steroids to mitigate the reaction.\n\nThe doctor refused to prescribe pain meds. The nurses asked her a number of times, finally she said I could have Toradal.\nAnyway, I wasn\'t looking/feeling better and both nurses decide to contact the doctor again requesting pain meds.\n\nWhen the nurse came back, she whispered to the other nurse that she asked the doctor whose response was ""I don\'t believe him"".\nIt\'s one thing to go through crap like that from ER doctors who don\'t know my history, but from the doctor that\'s been treating me for over 5 years?\n\nI know this is an unusual situation/question for this sub, but at this point I\'m at a loss for what to do.\nSo, doctors in the sub, what do you recommend?'"

macrobid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/ap25ar/quick_and_probably_paranoid_question_about/,b'Quick and probably paranoid question about Citirizine dosage.',,"b'So about 2 weeks ago I had this urticaria episode, random huge welts and red areas with what looked like random red lines, etc. I also had extreme itching and pain in my right arm after it got covered by a huge area of welts fused together. No one knows what caused this and the only hint could be that I had just finished a round of macrobid antibiotics for a UTI though I had taken that before with no issues. Anyways my doctor prescribed 20mg Citirizine and I swear the bottle says ""take 1 tablet twice daily for 1 month"" but someone mentioned that was a lot so I googled it and damn it says everywhere I shouldn\'t even be taking more than 10mg daily, is that true? Though to be fair my damned welts were intense and I had never had a rash in my life, let alone with actual painful welts so maybe that\'s why I got prescribed a high dosage? I think I\'ve taken this for 2 weeks now so did I kill my kidneys or something? I swear the bottle says 2 pills daily so I\'ve been taking them every 12 hours. They help by the way but the welts are still coming back though with significantly less pain and itchiness. I\'m currently waiting for a referral to see the allergy doctor. Anyways, just scared I might have ended up needing to check my kidneys or something. Also I went to see my doctor again on Wednesday for an update on this and I think he told me I could switch to benadryl now, the OTC one but ugh no one tells me for how long -_- and yeah I was still flustered over the welts not going away so I didn\'t really ask either. Anyways, I would appreciate any responses to this, I know the doctor prescribed this but who knows what if the pharmacy made a mistake? With my luck well it could be :/ Thank you in advance.'"

If you\'re reading this it\'s because you\'re either coming up to getting an MD (Microdiscectomy), want a MD (I did the same searches) or have had a MD and want to calm your nerves (literally and figuratively) regarding what you feel.**\n\n\n\n\n#Long ass Backstory, feel free to skip this if you just wanna get to my advice.\n\n\nI herniated my L5S1 disc around November 2020. Initially it was treated as a \'get over it\' sort of injury, people around me initially thought I did something to my hamstring because how could an otherwise healthy 23 year old get a spinal injury; my ex\'s physio convinced me that nothing was wrong and that I\'d be all fine and dandy if I just pushed through it. Of course, as the pain didn\'t improve, my lack of regular, known and friendly Doctor meant I wasn\'t really taken seriously till much, much later.\n\nAfter said ex kicked me out of her life because I just laid on the couch in pain (bad sign, if you don\'t improve after a few weeks SEEK MEDICAL HELP from a *GOOD DOCTOR*), I moved back home with my parents (funnily enough, that phone call I made to mum explaining how my life fell apart and I needed to flee home was captured by an Apple Maps Street View car. The LOWEST moment of my life is publicly viewable. I have it bookmarked and show people for a laugh). Embarrassing, but important. After a few months of being there, I knew I\'d have to \'start the process\' in whichever new city I moved to.\n\nOnce the move occurred, I sought out a trustworthy GP. Mum mentioned that as a child Lyrica was prescribed to me and it helped me a bunch and that I should go to talk to a doctor about it. I did, and it didn\'t really do much at the low dosage I was started on. In the end I was on 600, sometimes 1200mg a day, but I digress.\n\n\'the process\' is the pathway of increasingly severe interventions a Primary Healthcare Provider will request to help manage your pain and overall condition. Surgery is the last and most serious intervention they can request, they don\'t want to operate on you unless they know it\'s the only thing that will fix you. Call it ego on behalf of the surgeons, but the reason you have to go though with all of this is simple, you don\'t want surgery unless you absolutely need it. If a twice yearly injection \'fixes\' you, that\'s good news. Run with it. In my case, I got my first CT guided injection roughly 1 year after the initial injury. I couldn\'t really help it, the city I moved to is the city known for having the most lockdowns in the world, so even though I arrived in August last year, it wasn\'t until something like November or December that year that I received my injection. I don\'t know if it was the additional movement due to the lockdown ending and me finding work or the injection but I began to feel better, but that feeling didn\'t last long.\n\nAfter switching jobs to something I thought would be better (it wasn\'t), my pain got worse. Then, one day, I crashed my Electric Scooter doing something dumb to impress a girl (she didn\'t sleep with me again, boooooooo). Mum argues that is what made my herniation go from \'manageable\' to \'unbearably bad\' and although I disagree, it was around that time that I realised this new job was horrible and made my back condition worse. I was pushed out of that job by the incompetent asshole of an owner (your groans and cries of pain are off-putting to the customers perhaps you should consider another job). Never again. I left that job in April of this year and have been (sadly, not from a lack of trying) unemployed since.\n\nFrom there, I spent the next 4 months on my ass getting worse and worse. I\'d given up. Who can blame me? I was in crippling pain every day, my mood was super low and my dreams were shattered. I\'d moved to this new city hoping to make a fresh start and I\'d ended up being haunted by the ghost of my past. In those 4 months I considered either throwing myself in front of a car to cause Cauda Equina, throwing myself off my balcony to end the pain entirely, or going to hospital and telling them I wasn\'t leaving until I got surgery, cut marks on my arm notwithstanding. It sucked. I wouldn\'t wish it on my worst enemy, well, maybe my *worst* enemy, but definitely not someone I disliked a bunch.\n\nFrom getting referred to see a specialist and getting my second (ineffective) injection in April to seeing a specialist in August, I was in Limbo. This was the time where my left leg lost a lot of muscle mass and mobility, compounding the issues I was facing and making things worse. I was so fucking glad I had the scooter, I don\'t know if I\'d still be here if it weren\'t for me having it, I have no clue how I\'d have gone to get groceries or get around in general otherwise, was absolutely my \'mobility scooter\' for the entire time.\n\nSeeing the specialist in August was the first time I had hope in a long, long time. As negative as it sounds, being told that ""you can do all the physiotherapy, exercise, walking, well wishing and medication you want, but you won\'t get better unless we remove that thing from your back"" was the best thing I\'d ever heard. I felt vindicated for all the time I\'d spent languishing in pain, being told by bad physios that \'you just need to push past it\' (horrible advice, if you have a scan that shows a herniation larger than 1cm you ain\'t pushing past SHIT), taking more and more severe medication to control the pain, all of it for nothing to change. My surgery was a definite \'end\' date to this period of my life.\n\nI was classified as a category 2A patient. Category 1 is \'oh shit we gotta do something about this or you\'ll end up with serious damage/dying\', category 2 is \'oh damn we need to get you fixed up but you won\'t die or be left crippled from this if we put you on ice\' and category 3 is \'uhh, I guess we should operate, but you don\'t seem too phased by this so we\'ll see you in a year\'. Mum again thinks my scooter crash bumped me from a category 3 to a category 2, and if that\'s the case, I\'m fucking glad I did because I\'d have ended up on my ass either way, so if I get surgery earlier because of it I\'m happy.\n\nFrom there it was a waiting game. I was told 3 months was the \'recommended\' amount of time I should be operated within, but given the fact they couldn\'t operate on Category 2 patients at that time (my consult was via phone but they deemed my situation so important that I should come in, they even tried to keep me overnight to operate on me the next day, but the surgeon told them (and me) to get the fuck out because she literally couldn\'t do it) and given the fact that the public hospital system was broken and still remains broken, I wasn\'t expecting to get a surgery date until next year whilst simultaneously letting them know to just \'chuck me in wherever you can fit me, even if it\'s 24h notice\'. Once I was told I was getting surgery, I could also push my GP (doctors where I live are called GPs) to give me stronger medication. I was given Codeine paracetamol beforehand, and arguably too much of it because I developed an addition to it, but I could now ask for stronger medication because it was a \'make me comfortable whilst I await surgery\' sort of thing instead of a \'I need this to walk but not really walk just to sleep properly but not sleep properly mainly just not feel pain for a few hours\' sort of thing.\n\nBang on 3 months, I got the call. ""Hey, what\'s going on? you didn\'t respond to our email, we want you to fill out this form and get your blood test done so you can have surgery!"" Wish I got that call last week, because I spent the weekend languishing in pain, mental and physical. My surgery was less than two weeks away. Amazing. Mum cried a little, she\'s got so many back, shoulder, neck and knee problems and she knows how good it feels to be told that \'we will fix you soon\'. If you\'re waiting for that call, and I promise it\'ll come, it\'ll be like finding out you got your dream job, it\'s such a relief, the light was now visible at the end of this horrid tunnel.\n\nBut now my feelings of helplessness were replaced with feelings of concern and anxiousness. What will I do to recover? how will I get food? Will I reherniate 3 days after and be back where I was? I\'m completely alone, how will I deal with things like dishes, cleaning, organising things? Sure, my spoilt, child-like, \'I moved out of home but not really because my parents own this apartment and I see them 5 times a week anyway\' 23 year old housemate who has to be nagged to unstack the dishwasher let alone clean anything will be about as helpful as catnip at a dog show so yeah, completely alone; all of these questions now flew around my mind and caused me to panic, and I\'m mainly writing this because...\n\n\n\n#Here\'s all of the things you should do to prepare for your Microdiscectomy\n\n\n##Do a buttload of washing and clean your house\n\nYou\'ll need clothes. You\'ll need clear spaces, or at least clear spaces which you\'ll make messy but be able to clean up without bending, you\'ll need clean bed sheets, you ain\'t changing them for at least 6 weeks if your bed is in the corner like mine is, all of these things need to be done and they all need to be done before your surgery. A mate of mine came over to help me clean, mainly to keep me on task but it was important.\n\n##Have a plan for food and pre-purchase any heavy goods\n\nYou won\'t be able to carry anything heavier than a gallon for 2 months. Plan accordingly. I moved my microwave from below the counter in a \'microwave hole\' as I call it to on top of the counter. I didn\'t buy foods that required oven cooking, and if I did I didn\'t eat them until at least a week after surgery. I got a bunch of noodles, random fruits and veg, a bunch of these things called \'Zooper Doopers\' which are sticks of frozen sticky liquid which you either eat like a candy bar or bash on the counter to make into a smooth ice dessert,  whatever you like to eat get some of it and eat it during your recovery. I filled my veg crisper with lettuce, oranges, pears and carrots.\n\n## Treat yourself to some paper plates, disposable cutlery and plastic/paper cups\n\nLast thing you wanna worry about is doing dishes or stacking/unstacking a dishwasher. If all of your tableware is disposable, you won\'t have to worry about it or risk your back bending down to stack/unstack a dishwasher. Yeah, environmentally it sucks, but you\'re recovering from surgery. Remember, environmental atrocities are still being performed en masse by faceless, greedy corporations fuelled by humanity\'s desire to destroy the planet on which they live; fuelling the ever growing hunger for growth and dividends; the horrible late stage capitalism we all know and love. Don\'t stress it, the disposable cups, plates, bowls and cutlery won\'t make a damn difference (think globally act locally is a disgusting lie), I forgive you.\n\n##Buy a \'grabby stick\' or reach extender\n\nThere\'s no worse feeling, especially directly after surgery, than awkwardly picking something up off the ground or reaching to grab something. An example would be me forgetting my AirPods on the other side of my bed. Pre surgery me would have just reached over to grab them, post surgery me has to log roll his ass onto the bed, grab them, then log roll off the bed to leave the house. Get a grabby stick. My recommendation would be for one with a metal rod which directly connects the jaws to the handle. you can rotate the head, apply way more pressure to things than the string based ones and it won\'t break on you.\n\n##Have shoes you can put on whilst standing\n\nI didn\'t. First thing I bought  post surgery were a pair of comfy, slip on vans (platform with checkerboard patterns because I\'m secretly an emo kid from 2007), you don\'t wanna fuck around with laces, and I love laces, my normal boots are 11 eye Solovairs, I know I was drunk on a night out when I wake up with my pants around my ankles laying the wrong way in bed with my boots half off because it requires perseverance and gumption to get them off, so you\'ll want something that isn\'t that.\n\n##Don\'t over-prepare\n\nIt\'ll be tempting to do some whack shit when you prepare for your MD, especially if you\'re alone. I did a bunch of other things, but I won\'t mention them because it\'s pointless to do so. They didn\'t matter.\n\n#My recovery experience so far\n\n* Day 1 was me waking up from anaesthesia and walking around my ward a bunch and having troubles getting in and out of bed. They give you a bunch of drugs so you aren\'t in pain, but you should feel immediate relief.\n\n* Day 2 I got released from hospital. My mate picked me up and we went to a local market and wandered around eating cool food and getting harassed by meat vendors. That was such a special day to me, not only because I\'d just spent a day in hospital but because for the first time in years I didn\'t feel like I needed to sit down or take way too many pills to enjoy myself. It was great.\n\n* Day 3-5 was nerve pain free and very comfortable. I had drugs to keep me feeling good, my back was incredibly stiff and sore, but I could walk and found it incredibly enjoyable. Be aware that this is a temporary feeling. Walking after a MD is such an amazing and novel thing, but you are still beholden to your stiff back.\n\n* Day 6 I walked a little too far and stretched my leg a little too much and my sciatic pain came back. I legitimately though I reherniated. Despite the specialist assuring me that \'you\'ll know when you\'ve reherniated\', you\'ll think that any sciatic pain or general leg pain is you reherniating and feeling terrible. Funnily enough, that was the day I forgot to take my medication, silly me, wonder if that had anything to do with it.\n\n* Day 7-11 was really more of the same, I\'d feel better, do some whack shit (like walk 4 km, the furthest I\'ve walked in 2 years), suffer the consequences (I got goddam DOMS from **WALKING**. ONLY in my left leg), think I\'d reherniated, remember that I hadn\'t taken my meds, take my meds and feel A-Okay again.\n\n\n#Things I\'d tell someone if they were facing a Microdiscectomy procedure\n\n##Everyone\'s journey is different and it\'s okay if yours isn\'t the dreamlike recovery you see described here\n\nYou may not feel complete relief immediately post surgery. Sorry, that\'s just the truth. I did, and it was amazing, but it wasn\'t linear. Once the Lidocaine in my back wore off and I was out of Oxys I started to feel sciatic pain again. It\'s a horrible feeling, you\'ll think you reherniated and that it was all for nothing, it\'s kinda crushing. But you will continue to get better. I keep thinking \'damn this shit isn\'t working\' but then I remember I\'m less than 2 weeks out from getting operated on. I\'m not even meant to be driving a car let alone completely healed from this. Depending on how long it\'s been since the initial incident, you\'ll feel more or less sciatic pain post surgery. This is because you have other associated problems like nerve damage (which will repair itself), restricted range of motion in the affected leg, muscle weakness stemming from your aversion to using that leg (you know, because it hurt like hell to do) and other random bits and pieces. I, for example, have to lose 20kg (45lb) to fit back into my pre injury clothing. That\'s gonna suuuuuuck, but at least I can now.\n\n##You aren\'t going to be as fucked up as you think you will be\n\nWhen you hear \'spine surgery\' you think of stupidly long recovery times and a complete inability to do anything meaningful, I know I did. Reality is, most people are up and walking after surgery. I was. Sure, you might get worse in the few weeks after surgery, but I was pleasantly surprised by how ambulant I was in the days after surgery. I made hamburgers, went for walks, was able to pretty easily stand up for extended periods (and preferred it to sitting), Absolutely didn\'t need the 20L of water I bought to put in my room *just in case*. As long as you\'re careful, and trust me, you\'ll be careful, you\'ll be able to do a surprisingly large amount of things immediately post surgery. Heck, I put on and hung up a load of washing because my asshole housemate couldn\'t be fucked doing it whilst I was in HOSPITAL, dumping it into my basket and washing her own shit, leading to it rotting and stinking up. Ugh. But still, I was able to squat down carefully, put it in, drag it out, kick it across the floor, pick it up from the basket with my grabby stick and hang it up. I didn\'t enjoy the process, but I was able to do it.\n\n##Beware of the period after the initial stiffness dies down\n\nAfter about a week post surgery the overwhelming stiffness that forced you to log roll and be careful of your back will fade. This is both a good and bad thing. It\'s good because you know, healing, but bad because you\'ll have what I like to call \'oops moments\'. You\'ll forget you have had back surgery (yes strange I know) and and instinctively go to do something, only to feel something weird, scare the shit out of yourself and slap yourself on the wrist. I dropped my AirPods case in a gutter full of rain water (the case is fine thankfully) and had a little split second freak out of ""Oh shit, I need to grab that now. OH SHIT BENDING DOWN TO PICK STUFF UP REQUIRES CAREFUL PLANNNING AHHHHHHHHHH"" and very carefully squatted and was able to fish it out of the gutter. Phew. Other \'oops moments\' include:\n\n- Shifting around in bed and feeling weird pain from your back and freaking out thinking your reherniated\n\n- Hearing the door ring with the pizza you ordered and launching yourself out of bed instinctively only to catch yourself, flop back into bed and log roll out of bed\n\n- Having the dog step on your nuts (seemingly her favourite activity) and having to resist the urge to curl up from pain, or at least curl up in pain in a safe manner, something which is hard to do because a goddam dog kicked you in the nuts.\n\n- Having your phone fall off the bed and going to twist and reach for it, only to again catch yourself doing that, log roll out of bed and fish it out with your grabby stick (buy a grabby stick buy a grabby stick BUY A GRABBY STICK)\n\n- *NSFW* Going to jerk your hog and realising you can\'t reach it properly laying completely flat and straight so you go to bend your back like you always do, catching yourself and working out some other way of making that whole thing work.\n\n- Getting out of the shower and going to bend down to dry your legs, catching yourself, getting annoyed and instead letting those boys air dry. I\'d consider getting a Terry cloth bathrobe instead of a towel so you can just wrap yourself in it to dry off.\n\n\n##Old habits die hard\n\nWhen you hear you\'re getting a MD soon you\'ll start to think of all the amazing things you\'ll do when you get out of surgery. You\'ll go for big walks, get back into the gym, never take muscle pain for granted ever again, whatever. But old habits die hard. You\'ve just spent X amount of time doing very little in the way of movement due to pain. Even with the absence of pain you\'ll very quickly slip back into these old habits. I know I have. Surgery isn\'t the immediate cure you think it is, it simply removes the root cause of your overall condition. In my case, my left leg still has the same crappy ROM it had before surgery, that isn\'t fixed. That\'s why my leg will hurt after extended walks (extended being more than 1km), it doesn\'t have the same ROM as my other leg and because I\'m actively focussed on walking straight and consistently I end up being sore afterwards. This will take time to fix, and once you\'re given the green light to attend a physiotherapist you\'ll be able to begin fixing those problems and *really* recovering from all of this.\n\n\n##Start lifting mindfully and never, ever stop\n\nYou will have a weak spot in your back for the rest of your life. How do you protect it? By making sure the muscles that surround it are as strong as they can be. Right now they\'re weak, tight and fragile, like your back is. Eventually the Annulus Fibrosis will seal back up, but it\'ll be with scarred tissue. When you\'re recovering, talk to your physio about what you can do to strengthen that area and never stop doing those things until you die, or become so old you can\'t.\n\n\n###*Arguably the most important one*\n\n#*Your time suffering from sciatica has been a gift. Do not forget your pain.*\n\n*You have, in a sick way, been given a gift*. This gift is a glimpse into your future if you don\'t take care of yourself. If you get surgery, you get to leave the pain cave. Many people don\'t get that luxury. This is your gift. Cherish it, remember it when you don\'t feel like going to the gym, doing your stretches or going for that run in a year\'s time. Never, EVER forget the pain you lived through, the dreams you had of not being stuck inside your home, unable to exist in the world as a healthy, ambulant, productive member of society, completely hopeless and alone in your suffering. I won\'t ever forget that time, it was horrid, easily the worst time in my life, I\'ll probably get some sort of tattoo to etch it onto my skin to ensure I don\'t ever forget it.\n\n#Suffering from Sciatica was the worst time of my life, and I\'ll do whatever it takes to make sure it stays that way.\n\n\nBoy, that was a long post. I don\'t really care, you don\'t get a TL;DR. I\'m glad I got to write down my thoughts, and if it helps anyone I\'m glad.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions about what I discussed or any questions you have in relation to the process. I\'ll probably make a post at the 6 or 12 week mark, see how I feel about it.\n\nAlright thanks for listening.'"

I need the pain relief but I have severe anemia & have thought maybe the ibu could be causing blood loss (dont have any ulcer symptoms but I havent started dxg yet) \n\nIve felt strange ever since. But Monday, I also had a bad reaction to a mmj edible (was locked in for almost 3 hours, I thought I was having a stroke). Could the diphenhydramine be metabolizing differently alone than the combo?\n\nI have a host of other medical problems I should be having diagnosed but not really interested in doing anything to prolong my existence (therapy is on the to do list as well)\n\nBut Ive never taken Benadryl just for allergies, always as a sleep aid & with a painkiller like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. I stopped the acetaminophen because of the potential for liver damage after long term use. Ive had sleep problems since around 1995 & they just get worse with age. If I try to sleep with nothing, I just doze in this really disturbing limbo. Very similar to what I experienced Monday but I literally do not even remember trying  to go to sleep, which makes me think it was the edible. I was thinking coherently, the day was just on replay in my head, but I couldnt move without a LOT of effort. Even swallowing was deliberate, not reflexive. \n\nMy apologies for this muddled mess.

NSAID,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/10lhvuw/sciatica_newbie_63_years_old/,b'Sciatica Newbie - 63 years old',,"b""Quick bio:  63 YO female, had mild scoliosis my whole life with no real impacts.  Now I have some degenerative changes due to aging and what I believe is an injury due to weight lifting, which is spondylolisthesis of L4 slipping over L5.  \n\nAbout six months ago I started to experience a lot of pain while sitting up in bed.  That evolved into sciatica radiating down into both legs and I eventually went to the doctor for that.  She put me on a burst of prednisone, which was very effective, but when I was done with that the pain gradually returned.  Now it's changed and it's mostly right side.  \n\nHere is my problem.  I'm a musician and, though I'm retired from my day job, I have an active life with shows and rehearsals.  I have a show scheduled for this coming Saturday and have three rehearsals this week.  \n\nMy problem is that my sciatica comes back without warning and basically cripples me.  Yesterday I could not walk unless I was bent almost fully over and I could not bear any weight on my right leg at all.  It was so bad I ordered a pair of crutches so that I could get around without using that leg at all.  \n\nI had a rehearsal last night, and I have prednisone leftover here so I took that in 10mg increments until I hit a point of relief just so I could get through my obligations (40mg was the magic).  I know that I can't use prednisone every day but it is the only thing I've done so far that gets me functional.  I do have several different kinds of braces that I wear depending on where the pain seems to be radiating from but they don't always help. \n\nI texted my doctor yesterday; it's very hard to get an appointment with her, but she sent me to a nurse for two injections today; Toradol and decadron.  From what I gather, one is an NSAID and one is a steroid.  \n\nIn the meantime I've also been doing stretching and physical therapy, and I'm on 15 mg of meloxicam daily and also nortryptyline.  I don't think any of that is helping much.  \n\nI have an appointment with my doctor on Feb 2, not sure what I should be looking for in terms of next steps. This thing is utterly crippling when it comes on and I am not sure what I can do on my own to alleviate this.  I have thought about contacting a different doctor through telehealth to see about getting emergency prescriptions so that I have prednisone around for burst use when I just need to be functional over the short-term, like when I have a show.  I know the dangers; my career was in public health and I understand what it does to my immune system and my adrenal glands and not to use it daily.  But so far it's the only thing that's given me my life back long enough to get something done.  \n\nI guess I'm looking for any additional thoughts.  I'm so new to this.  I had no idea this could be so crippling and I feel so bad for everyone here who goes through it.  My heart goes out to you.  Thanks in advance for any help or thoughts you can offer."""

My father, aunt and uncle also have acne. My Fathers acne went away when he was about 28-30,all of them have bad scarring. (My uncle has horrible deep scars and his acne is just like mine.) My uncle seems to get more scarring with age. Now at 37 his face is covered in super deep scars. I had clear skin for few years, but now my acne is completely out of control. \n\nI always had moderate-mild-ish acne form when I was a kid, I scarred only when I used epiduo, but in general, my acne didnt leave much scars. in 2017 I found a derm, who prescribed me adapalene+clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide 5%, + dexpanthenol cream (bepanthen) as moisturizer. It worked wonders. I didnt have any purge, my skin was clear after 4-6 months. After that I periodically used adapalene, but for the most part, I had very mild acne, just few pimples that didnt bother be much. \n\nI was relatively clear for 2.5 years, and 2.5 years ago I suddenly started to break out more. Had a lot of stress back then, so may be it was a trigger. I tried same formula again - it didnt work. I used BP and Adapalene gel alternately for some time and it made my skin worse. I tried to moisturize again, but I felt that the cream clogged my pores and made acne worse this time. So I stopped, and the products dried my skin a lot. I stopped using them after about a month and used nothing on my skin, just cleanser and water.\nAfter that my acne started to get worse and worse. I went to 7-8 derms, they prescribed me all kinds of things like Azelaic acid, topical sulfur, different light acne products, all of which didnt work. \n* I must note that I have some kind of allergy to dimethicone, so all moisturizers like CeraVe, Cetaphil etc, cause my eyes to burn. any dermatological creams without it make my skin even oilier and break me out more. So I dont use them.\n* I have chronic lip condition called exfoliative cheilitis that make me even hard to talk. I have it for almost 2.5 years already, so its make it impossible to take accutane.\n* I have back acne that didnt change throughout the years. Just get 1-2 pimple a week. May be 1-2 pimples on chest a month.\n\nLast summer I tried adapalene again. Used it for 3-4 months, on last month I added BP again. BP seemed to work, but it dried my skin out completely. Even when I kept it on my face only for 15 minutes. My skin gotten only worse with each product I used. \nSo in November I stopped using anything on my skin but water. After all this products my skin became dehydrated and super oily. Its very tight, oily, flaky, and I get red rush randomly during the day.\n\nI used only water for 2 months and then I tried caveman regimen: I didnt wash my face for 40 days. Worst decision ever. It gave me a lot of scars, clogged and dilated pores, Ice pick scars between by eyebrows. I went to derm and she prescribed me accutane, so I decided to microdose, because of my lips. I take 2 10mg pills a week (8mg really, its lidose formula). Started in the beginning of March. No effect yet. I read that it worked for some people, so I hope, at least, for reduction in oiliness. Still washing my face with water only 2 times a day. On active pimples Im using metronidazole/AA AM and tretinoin+dexpanthenol PM.\n\nThe reason Im writing this is because every pimple of mine started to leave huge scars. I dont have cysts, just pustules, but they leave huge deep scars that 2 times bigger than pimple itself. My lower chicks are just a mess now. Im starting to look like a monster. So many deep scars from each pimple, Im ashamed to even take a photo of them. I cry every day when I see myself in the mirror, and I realize that its going to get only worse and I cant do anything about it. Im suicidal for the last 3 months. Dont know what to do. Derms only prescribe products like retinoids, that I already used and they made my skin worse. All skincare products that I use break me out even more.\nThinking about adding oral antibiotic like minocycline, but afraid if it will ruin my gut, since I have already some problems with constipation and drink a lot of pills. I just want to calm dawn breakouts for the next couple months to prevent further scarring until accutane begins to work.\nI already take vitamin D and Zinc supplements. All my bloodwork is great.\n\nSo here is my questions:\n\n* Did anybody take minocycline (maybe while on mini dose of accutane)? How fast it started to work?\n* What can I do to prevent scarring? Should I keep spot treat with tretinoin, hoping that it will boost collagen? (Azelaic acid didnt help with scarring)\n* Have anybody tried microdosing accutane? What was your experience?\n* I have topical clindamycin, but its drying, since it contains alcohol. Im afraid to use it on whole face. Should I use it?\n\nI would be really happy to hear some advise, or if youd just share your experience! Im really desperate for any help.\n\nI attached some photos of my skin and photo of my lips with chronic EC, that prevents me from full normal course of accutane. I didnt attach photos of scars on cheeks as Im ashamed to take them.'"

I have not felt super great about the progress made/relationship I've developed with the PA I've been seeing.\n\nI have not felt listened to regarding feedback I've been giving on various treatment methods/medication regimens. I feel like this PA is hearing me, but not 'listening,' and just kinda throwing medication at me willy-nilly.\n\nAn example of this is treating my PTSD diagnosis (my full diagnoses are ADHD, OCD, PTSD and GAD).\n\nMy provider opted to put me on Prazosin (blood pressure medication that has been shown to help with PTSD/nightmares). However, I am also on Lisinopril, a blood pressure medication. I take the Lisinopril in the morning. I took the Prazosin at night as instructed, and instantly my blood pressure DROPPED. Like, a lot. To the point where if any time I stood up I would immediately feel like I was going to pass out. It wasn't low enough to warrant a hospital visit, but I notified the physician and thankfully have a bff nurse who was there to watch and escalate if need be.\n\nFast forward to a couple weeks ago, my family was hit with a major tragedy that re-triggered and re-activated a lot of anxiety and increased PTSD flashbacks/night terrors and has affected my sleep. It wasn't the fear of sleeping, it was just my brain obsessively worrying and not turning off. I told my PA this, and they immed went to prescribe me Prazosin again. I had to insist and insist over and over again that they had already tried Prazosin, that I was NOT going to take it again because the adverse effects scared the absolute daylights out of me. And that it's not the dreams, it's the ability to sleep. I had to insist over and over and over again that they check my chart/prescription history.\n\nThere have been other things, but that's the most recent one.\n\nAnywho, I'm curious if others have ever re-thought their relationship with their psychiatrist, and what steps they took, if any, when questioning it. Like, I've been going to this office for around 5 years. But this new person isn't the person who has been treating me for all these years. I'm too anxious to tell the PA that I'm not liking their approach, though.\n\nI'm also like, is that a thing? Would I be looked at funny if I make an appointment with a psychiatrist because I'm not liking the relationship with my current/'updated' practitioner?\n\nI want to also be very clear that I'm not looking for someone to prescribe me a specific drug that the current PA isn't prescribing me. I'm not looking for a pill mill. I just question her approach and the most recent interaction re: Prazosin really rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nI'm just...idk. Either looking for validation that I'm making an 'okay' decision & that other people have gotten second opinions or changed dr's, or for feedback on what I could do to mitigate the thoughts/feelings I'm having. \n\nThanks for reading and apologies for the novel!"""

But we'll see how that pans out, as the situation is a bit  of a doozy. Or perhaps, the much-feared combination of doozies. A  multi-doozy epoch, if you will.\n\nAt  the outset of the pandemic, I got laid off from a job where I had some  decent opportunities and great, supportive colleagues. I had a tough  time finding work after that - quotidian lockdown stressors, job  hunting, and maladaptive coping strategies sent me spiralling into a  manic episode where I had to be hospitalized... Obviously this was  world-shattering and terrifying.\n\nI  spend the following year-and-a-half working a job where I feel totally  underemployed and useless. Once my contract runs out, I find myself in a  near-identical situation to 2020 after my contract expires.\n\nOut of work -> bored -> depressed -> pot/alcohol -> funny farm for a few days.\n\nThis  time was much worse and I successfully scared the living shit out of my  partner and friends, only bolstering my sense of alienation further.\n\nThis  time, my manic behavior was so awful, that I had to move back home with  my parents due to the way I was treating my partner. The immediate  month out of the hospital I felt totally estranged from reality and  living back home brought to surface many reminders of why I moved out at  such a young age.\n\nSome key things to note.\n\nOne,  I am aware that I am a fucking idiot - if insanity is making the same  mistake twice and expecting different results, then the shoe does indeed  fit well.\n\nTwo, my partner after  both episodes has chosen to stay with me. I am confused, yet eternally  grateful for that, but I will eternally feel guilty. So that's a healthy  dynamic, especially when talks of marriage are on the table (I have  suggested couple's therapy and she's amenable).\n\nThree,  my experiences with my industry (biotech) have left me completely jaded  towards the field. Yet, I am at the moment pigeonholed by my  experience. I want to switch careers (IT/lab automation/data  science...I'm open to options), but I am completely at a loss for a path  forward. A master's degree seems most sensible, but where is the money  for that coming from when I'm currently unemployed and still saddled  with undergrad debt?\n\nFour, I do  have a psych and therapist. Still unsure if the meds I'm on are right  for me though (wellbutrin+celexa: been equally interested and repulsed  by the idea of ketamine therapy or my skin potentially falling off via  lamictal).\n\nDespite these  experiences, I am still at my core an ambitious person. I love learning  and desparately want to improve my circumstances, however as I get older  (28 now...) my preoccupation with past failures and acute awareness of  limitations set forth by Time (and how I've routinely mispent it)  hampers my motivation. Too many of my figs have gone black as I sit  paralyzed with regret and self-loathing.\n\nI  have no schedule right now and every fiber of my being seems to resist  creating and adhering to one. Why? I can only guess, but as with other  failed attempts at self-improvement, it's most likely distrusting that I  will actually follow through with whatever my new goal might be. I  usually stick to a new habit for three days or so then just say 'fuck  it' and return to complacency.\n\n7 Habits of This Highly Ineffective Person:\n\n1. Eating/drinking alcohol out of boredom (for the record I completely quit pot, at least)\n2. Joylessly masturbating multiple times a day and then self-flagellating over porn usage\n3. Waking up to a 'PM' on the clock\n4. Chronic procrastination vis-a-vis video games, half-assed engagement with hobbies, scrolling\n5. Refusing to exercise and taking minimal action towards self-care\n6. Engaging  with the world in such a negative, critical light and almost believing  that those who don't (aka those who are happy, or at least content) are  ignorant...\n7. Leaving the door and windows unlocked for Comparison to come and go, looting happiness as it pleases\n\nAwareness  of these issues obviously isn't enough, but I feel like I have so much  to overcome that overwhelm just pushes me from one shitty habit to the  next, creating the illusion of activity.\n\nI  want to give up (or more realistically...severely limit my usage of)  alcohol, pornography, sugar, social media - essentially all those common  Opiate of the Masses types of things. And start exercising, reading the  hundred or so books on my backlog, reengaging with hobbies in a  thoughtful way. However, I just find a litany of excuses. Or in the case  of something like choosing a book from my library, I'm greeted with the  doubt that I'll finish it and even if I do, when's the next time I'm  going to find the motivation to read another one? Surely it's a futile  effort...(\\*eyeroll reacts only\\*)\n\nI  want to exercise, oh but my bike is too small and I don't have the  money for a new one...What about body weight exercises? Yeah, I  guess...I don't have a yoga mat though... How about going for a walk  then? My neighborhood isn't very walkable and I don't want to drive  somewhere just to walk, seems silly.\n\nI  want to improve my coding skills, but oh there are so many languages  and I'm too dumb to remember syntax and vocabularly, let alone  logic...Well you can just do what everyone else does and google those  things as need, plus didn't you take many advanced math courses in  undergrad? Yeah... but ever since my hospitalizations, I feel stupid and  incapable of remembering things.\n\nI  want to be more intentional with my art, but well there are so many  more talented writers/musicians/artists out there and what are the odds  of getting exposure? Shouldn't the primary goal of art be to nourish the  soul or whatever? Yeah...but, I should be using that time to job hunt.  Yeah, I suppose, but you aren't, you're just in bed, playing Tetris 99  ad infinitum and listening to shitty podcasts...\n\nI  just want to find the motivation to get back to work. Having income, a  place to go, a slight sense of purpose would improve my overall  situation greatly.

When I have a cold I sometimes end up going to the emergencies if for example over the counter meds don't work or what my doctor prescribes does nothing and it's past 7pm or during the weekend or like literally 3 in the morning no doc no pharmacy open and even then yes there are those on duty but they can only do so little.\n\nBeen struggling with this for a while and I can't stand it anymore. It's so bad that even strong meds don't work for me (have not built any resistance nor do I take them often, I avoid them as much as possible honestly.

M. Feedback Appreciated.\n\nHello, I am currently on 500mg of Divalproex DR (250mg tablet twice a day).\n\n\nRight before this, I was prescribed 10mg of Haldol (5mg morning/5mg night) when nightmarish hallucinations manifested due to sleep deprivation and my panic was noticed by my partner and mother. However, this treatment did not last long because I experienced really severe Tardive Dyskinesia (TD), so the doctor at the ER suggested that I stop the Haldo and gave me Lorazepam and Benadryl via IV to help alleviate the side effects. I then proceeded to take the 50mg of Benadryl that the ER prescribed for the following days until I saw my psych again.\nBefore the TD set in, Haldol's cons were that it made my mind feel really foggy after I woke up.\nI initially had numerous lows when starting Haldol (took 5mg the previous night/5mg that morning) where I'd tear up suddenly. It settled down throughout the day, and because the TD was really distressing, I didn't think the mood dips were as crucial. I don't know if that's related to the Haldol, but I still feel it's worth a mention.\n\nThe week following the Haldol ordeal, I started on the Divalproex DR. \nI have noticed some improvements after two weeks and got another two weeks refilled. While I did experience some random gloom here and there, it's short lasting. Overall, I did notice a significant improvement how I felt and those around me pointed out improvement of my attitude/behavior.\n\nHowever, as of lately, I have noticed a return in night time paranoia (which I'm anxious will cause night terrors again), and unfortunately experienced an excited state a few days a go and felt a rush of aggression seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nCurrently continuing Divalproex as instructed; I see my doctor next week and will mention this, but I was wondering if anyone has been through a similar situation and if the random paranoia/quick agitation/aggression was able to be treated. Hesitant to use antipsychotics again, but not completely against the notion. Any perspective is appreciated, thank you"""

Then, it came back again with new bumps every few days and the existing bumps never really going away.

I am very happy with the results so far and my skin feels smooth instead of oily.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\n\nDon't waste your time and money with any over the counter solutions for the Rosacea and go directly to a Dermatologist.  In America, I spent about $110 for the consultation with the doctor (no insurance) and $40 dollars for the prescription (after hunting for discounts).  Which almost equals the amount I spent on OTC solutions.  I can provide some pictures if requested."""
penicillin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/s0fgjn/so_many_questions/,b'So many questions',,"b"" Hello. I've suffered from psoriasis for 17 years now. It's a struggle. It all started after a big party and woke up next day extremely hungover. Progressively felt so bad I took myself to the hospital. Ended up with mono and strep. Have no idea how. Anyhow doctor gave me penicillin  had a horrible reaction, ended up getting a full body rash, then ended up with guttate. Started with small dots, then just got worse over the years. I'd say it's moderate now, as I have patches all over. Scalp being the worst, it's such a bummer!. Anyhow doctors are a joke when it comes to this desease. They laugh at me when I say I'm 90% sure I have this because I had strep and ask if they can look into getting my tonsils removed. They just shrug and say they have never heard of a thing. So been on steroids for years. So finally got fed up made a appointment with a Derm, got denied any treatment because I was told I had latent tb. So I leave the office confused as F. Asking how the F did I ever get TB, mind running wild. Went to my doctor got tested for tb about 5 times  all negative. So I asked them if they are giving me the latent tb test? I had 3 or 4 doctors say there is no such thing! Can u believe this? I did finally find one doctor that knew what the test was in emergency, but couldn't give it to me because it could get him suspended? Can you imagine? So I'm just like F this. Wtf. Then the pandemic happens. So now I think I have tb, I'm a strep carrier,  I feel like I have mono everytime I get a cold. Now I got to worry about covid, and I'm covered in psoriasis. \n  I just can't believe how uneducated some doctors are to psoriasis. I find it amazing that probably most of us know more about it then actual doctors. I've been put through the ringer....and I don't even know what to do anymore. I have a very busy job, 2 kids, a wife, and it's just work, family and sleep. Not alot of time to be running around trying to find answers from uneducated doctors.\n\n At my wits end. I won't give up on this, but wow....is it this hard for everyone else to get answers?  I bet it's even harder with covid around to get the help I need.\n\n Don't even know where to start anymore. Because I feel like the same thing is going to happen. I feel no confidence in doctors at this point.\n\n Still just as confused as the first time I went to the Derm..."""

I\'ll get straight to the point: I\'m a 29F with a mystery illness that has been eluding doctors for the last 10 years. It\'s getting to the point where I\'m thinking about suicide because I\'m unable to live this way anymore; coming to Reddit with this is pretty much my last resort. I\'ll start off by listing my symptoms from most bothersome to least bothersome, my medical history, and then I\'ll tell you what tests I\'m currently aware of having been done. I have the actual results available but be aware that they are not in English and it\'s over 20 pages long.\n\nSymptoms:\n\n- Fatigue : this is the main symptom. I\'m extremely tired all of the time. I sleep up to 16hrs a day. Sometimes I get sudden bouts of fatigue where resisting falling asleep is nearly impossible, I usually deal with this by just sleeping. I try to exercise but my physical fitness doesn\'t seem to improve at all despite going to the gym 3 times a week.\n- Diarrhea/stomach cramps/gas/bloating : I have diarrhea  literally every day. The stool is pure liquid. It\'s accompanied by horrific stomach cramps that can last for hours\n- Rash : there\'s a rash in my face that never really goes away. It\'s particularly bad around my eyes and mouth. I sometimes get patches of rash in the folds of my arms or in my armpits. They\'re itchy and very sensitive, sometimes swollen.\n- Vertigo : I get spells of dizziness. These spells can go from anywhere between a couple of minutes to several hours. Several times it has gotten to a point where I have to lay down and wait for it to be over because even just turning my head makes me nauseous.\n- Low blood pressure : I experience episodes of low blood pressure that often go hand in hand with the vertigo.\n- Abnormal vision : my vision will often ""swim"" amd I\'ll have trouble focusing my eyes.\n- Allergic rhinitis : runny nose, dry mouth, dry eyes.\n- Excessive sweating\n- Difficulty regulating temperature : I tend to feel very hot in the morning, throughout the day I go back and forth between way too hot and way too cold.\n- Cold extremities : sometimes my feet and hands are like ice and just won\'t warm up no matter what I do.\n- Migraines : these are actual migraines with halos and sensitivity to light and sound. I also get a lot of regular headaches.\n- Neck and shoulder pain : could also be related to an old sports injury and general shitty posture.\n- Paleness : could be related to other symptoms but I sometimes look paler than a ghost.\n- Anxiety : although I obviously have reasons to be anxious I\'m still mentioning it because it feels abnormal. I get random panic attacks that seem to come out of nowhere.\n- Cold sores : I get way more cold sores than normal people. I have one about every 2 weeks. Could be related to the rashes around my mouth of course.\n- Dandruff\n- Frequent urination\n\nI also experience some depression but to be honest I think everyone would be depressed if they were going through this. I\'m very slightly overweight, being 5ft3 and 140lbs.\n\nMedical history:\n\n- RCPD (basically your lower esophageal sphincter is too tight and won\'t let you burp), I got a botox injection that fixed this\n- Stomach ulcers\n- Eczema (as a child)\n- Lyme (as a child)\n- Arthritis in C4 vertebra, very mild, dr said it would not explain any of my symptoms except some of the neck pain\n- HPV : I had HPV in 2018, this is likely unrelated as my symptoms started long before that\n\nTests that have already been done:\n\n- RBC, platelets, hemoglobin, hematocrit : normal\n- WBC : high end of normal\n- BMP and CMP : normal\n- Cholesterol : normal\n- Iron : normal\n- Vitamin D : normal\n- TSH, T3, T4 : normal\n- (edit) Cortisol morning, evening : normal\n- Coagulation : normal\n- STI tests : normal except HPV\n- ANA : dubious, further testing for fluorescence and ANA-associated rheumatoid diseases revealed nothing, dsDNA was positive in first test but negative the second time\n- C3, C3d, C4 : normal\n- RX Thorax : normal\n- MRI cervical, thorasis and head : normal except the arthritis mentioned above\n- Ultrasound abdomen : normal\n- Gastroscopy : H. Pylori found, another one after treatment for ulcers was normal\n- Lactose intolerance : mildly lactose intolerant\n- (edit) Stool : don\'t have the specific results but they were normal, no mucus and no inflammatory markers\n- (edit) Tilt table test : normal\n\nMedication I\'m currently taking:\n\n- Neurontin : for the migraines, helpfulness is dubious\n- Cetirizine\n- Valaciclovir\n- A bunch of supplements, vitamin D, B12, magnesium, others\n\nThings I have tried that did not work:\n\n- Pantoprazole\n- Pepcid AC\n- Omega 3/6\n- Several different SSRIs and SNRIs\n- Bilastine\n- Others that I don\'t remember off the top of my head\n- (edit) Low FODMAP and low histamine diets\n\nI\'m sorry for the length of this post. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have, I will answer them to the best of my abilities. I really hope someone will be able to make sense of all this. Thank you for reading this.\n\nEdit: Reddit is acting up and won\'t allow me to read the last 30 or so comments. I\'m assuming they\'re going to appear eventually and I will read all of them at that time, but for now I\'m unable to respond, I\'m really sorry.

I'm 25 years old, I've been training at the gym since I was 18 - usually 3x a week, additionally I run once a week. The supplements I have used so far are: creatine, proteine supplements and pre-workouts. I don't drink or smoke, and I've never taken steroids. I eat healthy. Since I was a child I had health problems. I have been suffering from headaches  for years. Plus, since I started farming sex (18 years old) I have problems with erection. Not that I don't have it at all (it was the first two times - stress) . It's just weak and hard for me to achieve, so I usually have sex with an incomplete erection (60-70%), Same with masturbation morning erection also of poor quality for years. In addition, sometimes literally seconds after erection it starts to losem hardness. It doesn't matter if I AM alone or with a girlfriend, I just want change the position and I lost my erection. I've also had low libido for years  and I often have no desire for sex, I am often tired. I've been to several doctors as a kid, nothing it came out bad. In 2017, I started my examinations again, I visited a urologist and a neurologist (everything was fine), but at the endocronologist I had prolactin 2x above the norm, then in the hospital I had a MRI ( tumor wasn't detected), then  next prolactin check was normal, the rest of the hormones too. After that, I didn't go to the doctor for 5 years. In the meantime, I tried various preparations myself, e.g. Ashwagandha, Tribullus, Maca root, zinc + arginine( here a slight improvement), and sildenafil and tadalafil (the best for me,  in most situations I can normally have sex). This year, on September 2, I went to the hospital, fainted and had a heart attack.Same day After a few tests they let me out of the hospital and I started going to the doctors again and getting tested. It turned out that I have high blood pressure. I've been taking high blood pressure medication since September 20. First I got RAMIPRIL  2.5 mg, after 3 weeks the 5mg dose and now the third week I am on Ramipril 5mg + Amlodipine 5mg . I feel great, my head stop hurts  (previously I had a headache at least once a week, and sometimes 2-3 times a week). I really feel a huge improvement in my daily functioning. As for erections it's a little easier for me to achieve it, and morning erections are more frequent but it's still all of poor quality and I still have a low libido. Since taking these drugs for high blood pressure, I managed to achieve a full erection 4-5 times with woman, but it still doesn't work as it should.I'm getting tired of this, I need help. I would like to have normal sex and not on cialis or viagra. Now I will present to you the results of my research since the hospital. I've been to the family doctor (he said I have high blood pressure), two cardiologists (heart is fine, echocardiography fine, hypertension-drugs), neurologist(neurologically fine, hypertension) and endocrinologist(fine, hypertension). In the hospital: ECG 50/min(good), Computer Tomograph of the head fine, blood pressure 150/90. Most research blood tests fine, only Glucose 110[60-99], Creatinine 1.24[0.70-1.20]. After the hospital: a few days later, morphology blood test fine, urine fine, creatinine 1.10[0.8-1.30] and eGFR >60. Then Cholesterol 135[120-190], Cholesterol HDL 35.60 [40-60], LDL cholesterol 100, Triglycerides 88 [30-150], Glucose 93.3 [74-99], HbA1c 5.5% [4,8-6]. Further tests: TSH 2.98 [0.35-4.94], Creatinine 1.11 [0.70-1.30], Prolactin 304.85 [72.66-407.40], Testosterone 570.09 [47.01-980.56], FSH 3.10 [1.50-12.40], LH 5.87 [1.70-8.60], Estradiol 32.70 [11.30-43.20], Progesterone 0.57[<0.05-0.149], ACTH 62[7.20-63.30], Cortisol 20.70[4.82-19.5] and vitamin D 32.80 [30-50 optimal concentration]. Latest research now from early November: Fasting Prolactin 376.37 [72.66-407.40], Prolactin after MCP: 2511.39 mlU/l. Revised Cortisol 19.80[4.82-19.5] and ACTH 71.70[7.20-63.30] plus DHEA 11.30[1.70-6.10]. All these results were recently seen by an endocronologist and he did not find any hormonal abnormalities, what do you think? I'm curious about this prolactin, because it has been with me for years so elevated, the symptoms also match (low libido, fatigue, etc.) that's why I plan to supplement with Vitamin B6 in the form of P5P in the near future to check my body's reaction to it possible lowering of prolactin and then, if necessary, go to another endocrinologist.I would like to add that in January I am enrolled in the hospital for an MRI of the pituitary gland"""

Attending looks at her JVP, says he thinks she's volume up and diuresis will help. I didn't see the JVP (but I never do lol), and the AKI continues to get worse with diuresis, so we consult renal, who says they think she's volume down and the diuresis made things worse. They gave her fluids, and her AKI improved.\n\nAnother is a 40 yo woman with reactive airway disease (some kind of asthma-like presentation but we didn't know exactly what was going on). Attending looks at her JVP, says she's volume up, and diuresis might help clear out her lungs.

My symptoms have been on-going now for several months and have not improved at all. Oddly enough, I had symptoms appear at the end of October and then go away after a couple of weeks that match what Im currently experiencing. Prior to experiencing my symptoms in October, Ive had a number of other symptoms appear that I think are related, but I cant verify if they are or not.\n\nCognitive Issues\n\nCurrently the symptom Im experiencing everyday is a cognitive disorder. Its hard to explain exactly, but it feels as if I havent slept for a week or that I'm buzzed. The symptoms are typically worse in the morning and night. If Im working in the middle of the day I dont experience this issue (as much). The symptom also gets worse if I do any sort of physical activity like walking my dog, hiking, or mountain biking. That being said, I do sometimes notice I feel better after doing physical activity. Sometimes the cognitive issue is also paired with odd head sensations like head pressure that I notice around my ears and the back of my head. Sometimes Ill also have a tingling feeling that happens on the sides of my head near my ears. In addition to the tingling sometimes Ill have an odd aching sensation on the top of my head near the vertex (the coronal suture) and back of my head near where the occipital bone and parietal bone meet. The aching sensation almost feels like my skull is about to split open. Ive also experience increased head pressure and a pulsing sensation on my head sometimes when my cognitive issues are at their worst. Less commonly, Ill also have issues with vertigo and balance. Specifically, if Im walking Ill feel like my balance is off and Ill lean to one side- usually my left side. Ive had on-going issues with tinnitus as well. Its not persistent, but it seems to happen most often at night. I experience it almost everyday. Sometimes I'll lose my hearing temporarily as well and it'll come back after about a minute. Lastly, my left ear will sometimes feel clogged and nothing I do seems to relieve the pressure. My cognitive issues also seem to be much worse after taking a hot shower. Specifically Ill have increased head pressure and have an increased jet lag/hangover feeling.\n\nChest Pain\n\nThe second most common issue that Ive experienced is chest pain. The chest pain I have manifests in different ways, but usually its an aching sensation that I notice on my clavicle head and extends to the sternocostal head slightly and it occurs on both sides of my chest. Sometimes the pain is also a burning sensation. Ive also had pain that occurs in my sternum thats a sharp pain. Most often these pains occur at night or in the evening.\n\nHeart\n\nMy heart related issues seem to happen less often, but have started becoming more frequent as of late. The most common issues that I experience is heart palpations. Commonly it manifests with either a racing heart, the feeling I skipped a beat, or a fluttering feeling. I experience these symptoms most often at night and especially while Im sleeping. Ive had a few incidents where Ill wake up in the middle of the night with my heart racing. I wear an Apple Watch SE most of the time now since my symptoms started and Ive noticed my pulse is as high as 96 when I wake up in the middle of the night with my heart racing. I dont have nightmares- I cant honestly the last time I remember having a nightmare in fact. My pulse has recently been pretty high when I'm sleeping as well. Usually it's between 40 - 50, but recently it's been between 50 - 70.\n\nAnother issue I used to have, but has sense improved greatly since I cut down dramatically on caffeine and stopped eating late at night is heart burn.\n\nRashes\n\nAnother odd symptom that Ive started having is red rashes that manifest on my chest, stomach, arms, or legs. The rashes are usually a solid red color or are spotty and sometimes cover a large area or a very small specific area. Ive had a very large chest rash that covered the entirety of my chest and other times Ive had small rashes on my legs that look like a small line.\n\nEyes\n\nAnother very common issue for me is bloodshot eyes. I will usually wake up in the morning with my eyes completely bloodshot. The only thing that seems to relieve it is eye drops which I use at most once a day. I will strangely also sometime have very red and visible veins that extend from my pupil to the tear duck. Near my pupil Ill have a spot that can be either very red or slightly pink. I usually know Ive having this issue because my eye will burn and begin to water. Sometimes I wake up with this issue and other times it will come and go throughout the day. I usually notice it during the middle of the day while Im working on my computer.\n\nVeins\n\nI really dont know if this is a cause for concern or not or if its even related, but Ive noticed my veins on my arms and hands are more visible than they've ever been. Theyre a very deep blue color and theyre most pronounced in the morning, after I take a shower, or do any sort of physical activity.\n\nMuscle Mass/Weight Loss\n\nIve noticed that since of February last year to today, Ive lost quite a bit of weight. Last February I weighed approximately 138 and now I weigh about 130. I havent had any significant changes in my diet other than not eating late at night. I attribute most of my weight loss to muscle loss which I notice physically because Im not able to lift as much weight as I use to be able to. I use to take creatine monohydrate regularly which I know will increase muscle mass and weight so Im sure this is part of the reason Im losing weight, however, even after not taking creatine for several months Ive still struggled to keep on weight and muscle mass. Since my symptoms began Ive been diligently tracking my diet and on average I eat approximately 2,400 - 3,000 calories per day.\n\nMuscle Twitching\n\nThis is a symptom Ive had for at least a year now. Typically Ill notice it in my arm near the extensor carpi radials longus. What will happen is an uncontrollable twitching sensation that will be visible if I happen to look at it. This happens on both arms around the same area. Ill also have muscle twitching as well in my ankles sometimes, but its not very frequent. I've had it in my face as well on my eyes and lips. Occasionally Ill also have restless legs when Im sleeping, but this does not happen often.\n\nUncontrollable Teeth Chattering\n\nOne strange event that I had before was while I was sitting on the couch. I was feeling otherwise normal, but my teeth began to chatter uncontrollably for no apparent reason. I didn't feel cold either.\n\nHands\n\nAn issue that Ive had for many years now is cold hands. Sometimes theyre purplish in color, very pale or very red. My hands will become cold for no apparent reason. Theyre not cold 24/7 but at least several hours of the day. A specific problem that I have with my left-hand is that it will often be weak, specifically its difficult to pick things up with my left hand. Also when I type on my computer Ill frequently have pain in my wrist associated with it. My pinky and ring finger also sometimes go numb especially if I bend my arm for a long period of time.\n\nArms\n\nAs I mentioned above, I frequently will have muscle twitching in my arms. Another thing Ive noticed is that while Ive had my symptoms, Ive had a few nights where Ill wake up and my arm is totally numb. Lately for the last few weeks my left arm has felt heavy and perhaps slightly numb. It seems to happen on the outward facing side of my arm specifically.\n\nFace\n\nAn on-going issue that Ive had for years is facial flushing. It seems to have gotten worse since my symptoms began. It feels like I have a fever, despite taking my temperature and not having one. Ill typically notice the flushing mostly on my nose and it will extend to my cheeks. Sometimes when I get facial flushing Ill have congestion as well. I noticed Ill frequently have dark circles under my eyes as well. Ive had this issue for quite a while now, but its become even more pronounced lately.\n\nFeet\n\nMy feet are also frequently cold. Ive noticed my toes often are purple. My big toe on my right foot also has dry skin. This has been an on-going issue for years. Recently my left heel went completely numb. Ive since gotten feeling back but it lasted for a few days.\n\nAnkles\n\nIll frequently have heaviness in my ankles like theyre swelling, but they dont appear to be visibly swollen at all. Its been an on and off experience that can sometimes last for days at a time. One night my left ankle felt extremely swollen and painful. The veins in my legs were pulsating as well.\n\nThighs\n\nI havent had much thigh pain, but occasionally Ill get the same muscle twitching in my thigh or aching pain in my quadricep or my abductors.\n\nPrivates\n\nThis is one of the strangest symptoms Ive had. Sometimes Ill have issues where Ill have pressure near my prostate (I think). It makes me feel like I need to urinate even though I dont have to. Also have I finish urinating sometimes Ill have a pain in my privates like I just passed a kidney stone which I definitely don't have.\n\nStomach\n\nWhen I started having my symptoms I would typically have pain in areas like left flank above my left hip. It was either an aching pain or a sharp pain. I havent had that pain recently. Another pain that Ive had frequently (maybe a few days per week) is located on my top left abdominal muscle.\n\nBack\n\nIve had a dull aching pain in my upper back for quite some time that I attributed to my sedentary lifestyle, but lately its gotten a lot worse to the point where its very painful. Its still an aching pain but its much more severe. It's since gotten better.\n\nRibs\n\nI dont usually have rib pain, but when I do its an aching pain thats tender to the touch and lasts a few days.\n\nBreathing\n\nI havent had any issues feeling out of breath at all even when I had Covid.\n\nNausea\n\nSince December Ive had nausea maybe 5 or 6 times total and I didnt start having symptoms of it until January. It seems like its gotten more frequently lately. I havent vomited, but I have the feeling like I might.\n\nBad habits\n\nI had a bad habit of drinking a lot of caffeine per day. For at least a couple of years I think it was higher than 600mgs per day. I cut down to 600mgs per day prior to having my symptoms, but Ive slowly gotten down to having 100mgs of caffeine a day or none at all. I also used to eat at night shortly before going to bed which gave me heart burn and caused me to have sleep issues. I also used to drink lots of diet drinks like diet sodas. Ive since almost entirely cut out aspartame from my diet except I might have a diet soda a couple times per month. I think I also had a lot of sodium in my diet from the vegetarian meat substitutes and canned foods I was eating. I also drank a lot of water per day. Probably at least a gallon.\n\nPast events\n\nIn addition to the other strange past events Ive had like uncontrollable teeth chattering. Ive had a few other strange symptoms that have come and go. One such event I had was in July or September while I was mountain biking. I was biking up a hill but I didnt feel like I was pushing my self exceptionally hard. When I got up to the top of the hill I got very lightheaded and had the same jet lag/hangover feeling Im experiencing currently. The same happened in November shortly after I got over my symptoms in October. I had the same lightheaded feeling and cold sweats I experienced before while mountain biking. Also a few months back I had the same experience but while walking on the treadmill. I began having sudden cold sweats without explanation, but I didnt feel light headed at all. Another time I was taking my dog\n\nSleep\n\nIve mentioned that Ill frequently wake up with my heart racing, but I also sometimes wake up suddenly without any explanation. Sometimes Ill wake up because my back is in pain and I have to transition to my side or vice-versa. Ive tried both firmer and softer mattresses and neither seem to make a difference.\n\nSupplements\n\nMelatonin at night to help with sleep\n\nCannabis sleep capsules\n\nGingko biloba to help with cognitive issues\n\nCreatine (cut out since symptoms began)\n\nPre-workouts like amino energy or L-Arginine (stopped taking these when my symptoms began)\n\nEnergy drinks like Reign, Alani Nu, and Ghost that have 300mgs of caffeine and high B vitamins and taurine\n\nCovid\n\nI had Covid in mid-November that I tested negative for on Black Friday. It wasnt severe- mostly cold like symptoms with a very bad headache and head pressure. I thin Covid probably contributed to my current condition, but Im not sure if its the cause of my issues considering my major symptoms began before I got Covid in October.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTests Done:\n\nUTI - negative\n\nPSA - waiting on test\n\nUrinalysis - normal\n\nCBC - normal\n\nJAK2 - negative\n\nEPO - normal\n\nCRP - near 0\n\nSedimentation rate- near 0 / 2 march\n\nCreatinine - low 7.3\n\nHigh co2 in metabolic tests\n\nNT pro BNP - 26\n\nTroponin - 5\n\nLipase - normal\n\nFerritin - normal\n\nIron - normal\n\nFolate - normal\n\nCortisol - normal\n\nT4 - normal\n\nFree T4 - normal\n\nT3 Uptake - normal\n\nFree T3 - normal\n\nCreatine Kinase - normal\n\nTSH- high in October but tested twice and was normal high again in March\n\nImmuglobulin - normal\n\nA1C - normal\n\nLyme - negative\n\nKidney stones - negative\n\nCT scan on head - normal\n\nWhole body MRI - normal except for a minor bulging disc in my lower spine\n\nHIV - negative\n\nANA - negative\n\nSleep apnea- negative\n\nComprehensive Metabolic Panel - normal except slightly low creatinine, slightly high co2, and high albumin on very test\n\nLiver panel - normal except high albumin and low globulin sometimes.

Is that safe?'",,"b""I saw a psych NP from 2014 to 2020 that began in person but then moved to telehealth. I believe she moved to telehealth in late 2015/early to mid 2016, moved to Texas but kept her Rhode Island license. I looked through the records I had received a few months ago (I'm making copies for a new psych practice I'm going to), and it says I had been taking 15mg Adderall XR and 5mg Abilify from 2014 to around April 2017, alongside a Lexapro dosage of 20mg and then later 30mg. I have no memory of taking Adderall or Abilify, but I did remember being on a medication I couldn't remember the name of, so it may have been that.\n\nIs that considered safe to take 30mg Lexapro alongside those medications? I didn't have any heart monitoring in 2015 or 2016 or any sort of blood work/testing until 2020. Again, nothing bad came of it healthwise, I felt perfectly healthy in 2015 and 2016, so there's not really anything to be upset about, but this is all new to me since I have no memory of taking those meds at all.\n\nThe thing is, this NP moved out of state in I believe late 2015/early to mid 2016, but kept me as a patient via telehealth. From what I know, Adderall is a controlled substance, and this is before the laws were relaxed due to COVID, so was she allowed to keep refilling it while not located inside my state, even though she was licensed here? I stopped taking it in 2017, and I didn't feel sick or weird while on it, so no harm no foul really, but I'd like to know if that would have been allowed back then. I think the law was you had to see a patient at least once in person, which they did.\n\nJust to make it clear, from mid 2014 to early 2017, my records say I took 30mg Lexapro, 5mg Abilify, and 15mg Adderall XR. I genuinely have no memory of taking Abilify or Adderall. I remembered taking some med before/during Lexapro, and maybe that was it, and I just forgot.\n\nI took Risperdal before Abilify from 2012 to 2014. I had my prolactin levels tested and they were normal back in 2014."""

I have suffered from somnolence as my sleep has always been very aggressive (screaming , shouting, kicking and things like that) . \n\nI have never taken any medication for anything related to mental health but here i am :) \n\nFirst i tried Concerta but didnt go well with it, then Elvanse that went way better for me. Then a very small dose amitriptiline before bed for my sleep and that has made a huge difference. Wellbutrin for over 6 months now and it has been the best one (even better than Elvanse) for physical energy . \n\nSo ... i have been sleeping 8h a night and it has been great ! I wake up feeling rested and no need to nap as i used to (for years and years) . \n\nBUT i feel that my low grade depression and low mood is still the same.

My prolactin levels is around 20 - 30 and that is higher than the range but not enought to think it is a pitituary thing.. i looked around and it has to do with endometriosis . It could be this or something else but i have ZERO sex drive. I dont even think about it but i have a partner who do :P \n\nAnyway, Abilify / Aripiprazol has been suggested from my doc as a way to lower prolactin but at the time i have said No right away . Now i am considering as it could help my Wellbutrin work better and maybe help with libido?\n\nHas anyone have a good experience for this ? wellbutrin and Abilify (i also take a very low dose Elvanse but that one i can live without) and libido getting better or should i be looking for something else ? \n\nI know SSRIs kill libido so i am not yet considering those. \n\nThank you and PLEASE SHARE your stories'"

My doctor last year prescribed me nortriptyline to help with my chronic chest pain, but also to help me sleep through the pain at night because it keeps me up and I never get much sleep. I was scared to take it because of all the horrible side effects I have read about so I never took it. She recently just recommended for me to give it a try this time and she just prescribed me it again, 10 to 20 mg once a night. I think it should be important to also say that I take 2400 mg of Gabapentin daily, and also take around 8-10 mg of Dilaudid daily. That worried me because I also have read about Serotonin toxicity/syndrome being a possibility that could come into play because I am adding a new drug into my system that could cause that. Am I overthinking?  could this drug hurt me or help me and should I give it a try at the 10 or 20 mg range? Just looking for advice. Thanks!'"

Drink and eventually fall asleep, wake up anxious, end up drinking again for the anxiety and to have the ability to actually fall asleep. I quit drinking altogether a few weeks ago. My daytime anxiety has easily dropped 50% maybe more. However, my night time anxiety is in full force. As the night goes on my anxiety creeps more and more and I absolutely dread going to bed so as it approaches i just keep getting more uncomfortable and anxious. When it comes to bed time, I am lucky to fall asleep within 3-4 hours because I lay their anxious. The longer I lay there unable to fall asleep, the more anxious I get. If I'm able to fall asleep quickly, I usually shoot out of sleep within an hour with a racing heart and disoriented. I lay back down but the shock of it keeps me awake (for a long time). I met with a psychiatrist yesterday hoping for a low mg of Valium to take shortly before bed to help me wind down and stay asleep (I never mentioned that to her). She wrote me a script for Hydroxyzine. Anyone have experience with this? Does it help with anxiety/sleep? I can't stand sleeping like this anymore. Any advice or experience is greatly appreciated.

I was started initially on Trazodone, Topamax, and a some other medications because I had depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, nightmares, and that attempt. The Trazodone was a wonder with my insomnia, which I had struggled with puberty. Unfortunately, it fucked with me heavily in the morning. To the point of me not being able to walk properly.

In fact, Adderall makes me smarter than when I don\'t take it. Ambien doesn\'t seem to impair any cognitive functions after usage, so that can\'t be it.\n\nInformation seems to be light on the net for either of these meds. I get the feeling it\'s the Topamax, given that it seems to be called ""_Dopamax_"" on forums. I\'ve discussed it with my psychiatrist, but he seems to think it\'s all it\'s just in my head.

Guidelines underestimate the severity and duration of antidepressant withdrawal, with significant clinical implications.\n\nDavies and Read are both psychologists who have longstanding grudges against psychiatry. Both have also been chastised for getting papers published with dubious scientific methods.\n\nThe difficulty of meta-analysis is garbage-in, garbage-out. I am somewhat dubious of the conclusions, especially given the biases of the authors, but going through all the included studies to determine whether the conclusion is justified or not is laborious. I actually did a quick peek back when this first released, but it\'s time for a deeper dive. Let\'s go through the publications included in the meta-analysis, or at least the first part.\n\n[Montgomery et al. 2005](https://www.psychiatrist.com/read-pdf/22320/): ""A 24-Week Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Escitalopram for the Prevention of Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder""\n\n>Patients were randomly assigned... to 24 weeks of double-blind treatment with escitalopram (continuing with the dose level administered at the end of the open-label period) or an abrupt switch to placebo.\n\nIt is accurate that 27% of patients switched to placebo had an elevated DESS score at week 1. 16% at week 2. However, this compares to 9% and 8% who were continued; the placebo-controlled discontinuation symptom rate is 18% and 8% at weeks 1 and 2. (Whether this should be normalized for placebo is tricky, since many of the studies don\'t have a control. That is part of the problem.)\n\nBottom line: The study is intended for a different purpose, but it provides reasonably relevant data. The data are misinterpreted by Davies and Read. Severity is not covered.\n\n[Boghetto et al. 2002](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00023210-200216040-00006): ""Discontinuation Syndrome in Dysthymic Patients Treated with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors""\n\n>The mean time at onset of symptoms was 2 days after drug discontinuation and the mean duration was 5 days."" It occurred in 4/45 discontinuing fluoxetine (8.9%) and 22/52 discontinuing paroxetine (42.3%).\n\nBottom line: Yes, this is relevant, but it is not blind and not placebo-controlled. Paroxetine is a standout offender.\n\n[Oehrberg et al. 1995](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/paroxetine-in-the-treatment-of-panic-disorder-a-randomised-doubleblind-placebocontrolled-study/D4604C0DE0BDFAFB4E6AA1A9AEA8DF97) (note that the table misspells as Oehberg).

Most patients reported just one adverse event, most being rated as of mild or moderate severity\n\nAgain the comparator by Davies and Read is wrong (withdrawal over placebo is 21%, not the raw 34.5%)\n\nBottom Line: This is the correct study design, still the control-for-placebo issue, and we know that paroxetine is an offender.\n\n[Fava et al. 2007](https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/10/6/835/804825): ""Effects of gradual discontinuation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in panic disorder with agoraphobia""\n\n>Tapering of antidepressant drugs was performed at the slowest possible pace (50 mg every other week for fluvoxamine and sertraline, 10 mg every other week for paroxetine, fluoxetine and citalopram, with 10 mg every other day in the last segment).\n\n9 were taking paroxetine, no more than 3 taking any other specific medication. 9/20 developed discontinuation symptoms, but that\'s also 5/9 taking paroxetine and 4/11 not taking paroxetine. There were no controls in this trial.\n\n>""All discontinuation syndromes subsided within a month in all but three patients (27%). These three patients had all been taking paroxetine and displayed alternation of worsened mood, fatigue and emotional lability with trouble sleeping, irritability and hyperactivity, meeting the DSM-IV criteria for cyclothymic disorder except for duration.""\n\nBottom line: Paroxetine bad (sense a theme?) and leaving out paroxetine, withdrawal was relatively short and milder.\n\n[Tint et al. 2008](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0269881107081550) ([PDF](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269881107081550)): "" The effect of rate of antidepressant tapering on the incidence of discontinuation symptoms: a randomised study""\n\nThey called their tapers short and longer, but that\'s 3 days vs 14 days. I\'d say very short vs. short. Again, a pretty random mix of SSRI and SNRI. No controls.\n\nBottom line: Hard to interpret. Short tapers, and no baseline to compare to.\n\n[Rosenbaum et al. 1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322398001267): ""Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor discontinuation syndrome: a randomized clinical trial""\n\nSertraline and paroxetine produced discontinuation symptoms. Fluoxetine did not, unsurprisingly given its half-life and the short interruption. Although there was an uninterrupted control group, it appears not to have been compared.\n\nBottom line: Fair. I don\'t entirely understand what happened to the controls, but I got interrupted while reading.\n\n**Read et al. 2014, 2018, and read & Williams 2018 will come later.**\n\n[Yasui-Furukori et al.](https://journals.lww.com/clinicalneuropharm/fulltext/2016/05000/Characteristics_of_Escitalopram_Discontinuation.2.aspx) 2016: ""Characteristics of Escitalopram Discontinuation Syndrome: A Preliminary Study""\n\nNo blinding, no controls, but the study itself acknowledges its limitations and just says that discontinuation reactions are common.\n\nR.C.P. 2012 is a bit of a mystery. The article links to [https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/treatments-and-wellbeing/antidepressants](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/treatments-and-wellbeing/antidepressants), which doesn\'t provide any data and isn\'t an article, [or to a book review](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA147011407&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=14658720&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=nysl_oweb&isGeoAuthType=true). 512/817, mixed antidepressants, online survey, but the data are missing.\n\nThis seems sketchy.\n\n[Zajecka et al. 1998](https://journals.lww.com/psychopharmacology/Fulltext/1998/06000/Serotonin_Reuptake_Inhibitor_Withdrawal.3.aspx): ""Safety of Abrupt Discontinuation of Fluoxetine: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study""\n\nThis one actually triggered a memory for me, specifically the memory of having read this study, which then reminded me that I\'d done a briefer version of this very journal club, because this one is damning:\n\n>""After 12 weeks of fluoxetine treatment (20 mg/day), 395 responders were abruptly randomized to placebo (N = 96) or to continued fluoxetine (N = 299)...   Reports of new or worsened adverse events were similar for both groups at each visit after randomization. Patient discontinuations related to adverse events were also similar in both groups. Mild, self-limited lightheadedness or dizziness occurred in a small percentage of patients who discontinued fluoxetine treatment but was of little clinical significance. No cluster of symptoms suggestive of a discontinuation syndrome was observed. Abrupt discontinuation of fluoxetine treatment was well tolerated and did not seem to be associated with significant clinical risk. ""\n\nSpecifically, 64/95 (67%) of patients switched to placebo reported 1 or more adverse effects over the 6 weeks of follow-up. But 223/299 (75%) who had no change made reported events. *There was no withdrawal effect observed.*\n\nBottom line: This one is a flat-out lie. Calling this 67% withdrawal is true if you don\'t read it, but it actually goes against what the paper says.\n\n[Hindmarch et al. 2000](https://journals.lww.com/intclinpsychopharm/Abstract/2000/15060/Abrupt_and_brief_discontinuation_of_antidepressant.1.aspx): ""Abrupt and brief discontinuation of antidepressant treatment: effects on cognitive function and psychomotor performance""\n\nAgain multiple different drugs, with a 4-7 day double-blind interruption with placebo. Paroxetine discontinuation caused all kinds of problems; ""these effects are not evident in patients receiving fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram, suggesting they are not an SSRI class phenomenon."" This study had equal, fairly small numbers for all four drugs.\n\n[Sir et al. 2005](https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/depression/randomized-trial-sertraline-versus-venlafaxine-xr/) ([PDF](https://www.psychiatrist.com/read-pdf/16858/)): Randomized Trial of Sertraline Versus Venlafaxine XR in Major Depression: Efficacy and Discontinuation Symptoms\n\n""A priori analyses of symptoms associated with treatment discontinuation demonstrated no difference between treatment groups. However, in post hoc analyses, sertraline was associated with less burden of moderate to severe discontinuation symptoms. "" This study had 8 weeks of double-blind treatment, followed by a 2 week taper. There was no placebo, and the taper was not blinded (because everyone had to be off the medication at the end.) This is the wrong design to assess anything except burden between sertraline and venlafaxine.\n\nRead and Davies say that the study gave 85% discontinuation symptoms, 110/129, broken down into 39/67 venlafaxine and 44/62 sertraline. That\'s possible, but I cannot find the source for any of those numbers in the article. Actually, I can\'t make any sense of the numbers at all. There were 163 subjects total, 79 and 84 on sertraline and venlafaxine, respectively. I can make no sense of the Read and Davies numerator or denominator. If anyone else can, I\'m not certain that I\'m wrong, but I can\'t figure it out.\n\n[Black et al. 1993](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-42410-001): ""The abrupt discontinuation of fluvoxamine in patients with panic disorder."" I can\'t access the article, but that loses only an n of 14.\n\nLet\'s back up now.\n\n[Read et al. 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178114000833): ""Adverse emotional and interpersonal effects reported by 1829 New Zealanders while taking antidepressants""\n\n""A google webpage advertising the study was established ([www.viewsonantidepressants.co.nz](https://www.viewsonantidepressants.co.nz)). This webpage provided participant information and a link to the online questionnaire. The study was publicized in the New Zealand media via media releases, interviews with the researchers and advertisements.""\n\nThe website is defunct. The exact questionnaire does not seem to be available.\n\nHey, while we\'re processing badly collected data, I want the good stuff!\n\n>The majority (82.8%) reported that the ADs had reduced their depression. Participants reported the following levels of depression in the year before taking ADs: severe  42.7%, moderate  37.8%, mild  11.8%, and not at all  7.6%. While taking ADs the rates were: severe  10.5%, moderate  23.1%, mild  45.2%, and not at all  21.2%. The question While taking antidepressants my quality of life was.... elicited the following response rates: greatly improved  49.2%, slightly improved  36.1%, unchanged  5.8%, slightly worse  4.4%. a lot worse  4.5%.\n\nYes, no control... and no quality control... but 82.8% is a good effect!\n\nAnyway, 1367 provided responses about discontinuation effects. Read and Davies say that 750 of those 1367 reported some. That\'s not explicitly given in the text, but 55% report withdrawal effects.\n\nMy primary complaint is that this is an online survey that has demographics not matching the country with unclear question phrasing and, the biggest issue with such things, unclear promulgation. Did this get circulated by psychiatrists? By Scientologists? There is no way to know.\n\n[Read and William 2018](https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082545820&origin=inward&txGid=6c46292757c8434f923c84ab37d28749&featureToggles=FEATURE_NEW_DOC_DETAILS_EXPORT:1): Adverse Effects of Antidepressants Reported by a Large International Cohort: Emotional Blunting, Suicidality, and Withdrawal Effects\n\nAgain I don\'t have access to the article, just the abstract. It\'s another online survey. The same concerns apply.\n\nThe assessment for severity and duration includes some different studies. I\'m not going to repeat the exercise.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\n2258/4052... but of that, 1278/2330 is by studies done by Read (2014 and 2018). If you include the missing data from the RCP survey, then 512/817 more, for 1790/3147, or 56.9% of online study respondents noting some degree of withdrawal.\n\nSubtracting those out leaves a much smaller 468/905. They\'re also methodologically so heterogeneous that I don\'t think meta-analysis works, noting again the inclusion of Zajecka et al, which in fact shows the opposite of what Davies and Read assert.\n\nA more rigorous reassessment would require redoing the statistical analysis excluding Read\'s studies, and redoing this for the other conclusions drawn. I won\'t. I\'ve run out of interest. As I have asserted, once someone starts pulling methodological skullduggery and gets caught, all of their conclusions should be discarded. The problem isn\'t that the conclusion is necessarily untrue but that it is unsound; it is, effectively, fake science rather than real science. The onus is on the writer to provide real data and analysis, not make things up. And, in this case, use other, smaller, better studies as a way to disguise large, bad studies.\n\nThe devil is in the details. I agree that systematic review and meta-analysis are the top of the evidence pyramid, but that\'s predicated on the work being done carefully and in good faith. Bad systematic review is a great way to put a level of remove between the conclusion and the bad data underlying it. Uncovering that takes effortenough effort that it\'s an effective trick. If I were in charge of the institutions of science, I would want forensic statisticians on every study and critical readers to do assessment of every meta-analysis. That\'s not achievable, but it\'s still important to catch this and promulgate the catches when possible.\n\n**tl;dr:** Include large, bad studies in meta-analysis and you can hide that you\'re weighting bad data. It\'s scientific skullduggery.'"

It wasnt the actual being alone part that depressed me. . .  but it did make my realize how completely underdeveloped I am, and now Im feeling horribly depressed and inadequate because of it.\n\nSo heres a little background. I was adopted by my grandmother because both of my parents were drug addicts and completely unfit to care for a child. For the first 10 years of my life, it was just me and grandma. Her health was never great, though, so she was usually in bed most days and I would usually go off on my own, with little to no guidance or structure. My mom moved in with us after that, but she was pretty useless as a parent herself. Most of her days were spent knocked out on the couch on methadone, or caring for my grandmother (who eventually passed when I was 16).\n\nFast forward to the present, and Im now living in the worst environment possible for someone like me. There are seven people crammed into a two bedroom apartment. The household includes myself, my mom, step-dad, sister, and my sisters three kids. No one ever leaves because no one is employed, with the exception of my sister, who occasionally does some real estate. The other two adults are jobless junkies. The place is in complete and utter disarray constantly, and for the first three years there was never one moment of silence because of my sisters inability to reign in her kids. I was completely and utterly depressed those years, and only had the emotional and mental energy to put myself through community college and nothing more. My days were usually spent either in class, or holed up in my room-- and thank goodness I have a room of my own, at least theres that! I just didnt have the stamina to be out in that mess of a home. Things did improve once all of the kids started school and my sister started volunteering in their classes, so the household was actually quiet enough to be bearable. I slowly became more capable, and started doing more around the house. \n\nDuring the weekend, there was a welcomed change for once. The family left for a short vacation and I was allowed to stay home alone for the first time in a very, very long time. And the first day was absolute heaven on earth. I got everything tidied up, and went out and bought some new, clean kitchen ware with the budget I was given. We needed it, and I dont know why no one ever thought to make that investment earlier. I grabbed some basic ingredients too, and prepared a few lunches and dinners to keep me going for the next few days. I got to take a bath without any interruptions (theres only one bathroom and seven people, good luck doing anything without interruptions). By the second day, things were still wonderful and I asked myself why anyone would ever choose to *not* live alone. But the problem was, everything I attempted to do I was horrible at, because it was technically my first time ever trying my hand at anything, really. But I did try. The meals I made werent great, but they were edible, and the house was dirty beyond my capacity to even begin to know how to make it spotless. I still tried my best to put it together though, and it looked decent. When my family finally did come back, they noticed how clean I had made it. Ive always wanted to learn how to draw, so I gave that a try to keep myself occupied and my sketches came out looking like something a 12 year old might make. Theres definitely room for improvement. Then I tried playing around on the violin I got for Christmas and it sounded like a cat being gutted. But Im still depressed even now, because the whole experience made me realize that anything I do or learn, Im starting completely from scratch. Im 23 years old and barely know how to cook a meal, because of the fact that Ive never had any real adult figures in my life and because Im not living in the type of environment thats conducive to any kind of motivation. But I tried to learn and do as much as I could during the few days I was given, and Im hoping there will be more days like that to come. I desperately need them if Im ever going to make any progress. \n\nWell, thats the gist of how Im feeling at the moment. I thought it would be best to share it with people who might understand.

NSAID,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/uozbnd/could_healing_take_more_than_four_months_postroot/,b'Could healing take more than four months post-root canal?',,"b""I had a root canal performed on a molar that didn't require it (the offending temperature-sensitive tooth turned out to be the one behind, for which the cause was never established. However a subsequent RCT fixed it). The first root-treated tooth had no symptoms of its own, as the pain turned out to be referred.\n\nBut since the RCT it has been pressure sensitive and hurts (almost itches) when I wobble it. This began even before the RCT when the dentist first decided to replace the old filling, and never subsided. NSAIDs aren't giving much relief.\n\nOn a recent visit to my dentist to explain the problem, she did a cold test (no sensation, tooth is dead), an x-ray (showed no issues) and confirmed that she did not find any crack when looking for one during the procedures. She suggested the issue could be bruxism and recommended a nightguard. \n\nCould there be any other potential issue to look for? Or can some root treatments cause discomfort that is so long-lasting? I am finding it difficult to accept the bruxism theory, but will invest in a custom night guard anyway. I have been using a boil and bite one for a couple of weeks in the meantime, with no improvement.\n\n(No medical issues, non-smoker, no medications except NSAIDs)."""
depakote,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12gui46/pretty_lost_nonchalant_about_it_too/,"b'Pretty lost, nonchalant about it too'",,"b'First time posting in here! So I\'ve been dealing with depression for a little over 6 years at this point. I\'ve had numerous people tell me that I can\'t be depressed since I\'m able to get out of bed everyday, and that I\'m faking it. I basically have no friends - just acquaintances and two cats. The reason for not having any friends is that everyone wants me to support them, but when I need it, nobody\'s here for me - or they tell me I\'m faking it for attention or just flat out faking it since ""other people have it worse than I do and I just need to suck it up"" - or they act like it\'s a mental health competition. My depression is getting better - I just need medicine for it, and every time I ask for help, I either don\'t get the meds I need or I get put on something else that doesn\'t work and messes me up mentally and physically - such as depakote. I was on Zoloft then prozac many years ago, but the person who prescribed it to me didn\'t believe that either medicine could possibly be helpful since I had a bad experience with lexparo which this same person prescribed to me - and she has a mentality that if one thing didn\'t work, then all things similar to it automatically won\'t work, so it\'s not even worth trying. She wanted to put me on lithium after my neurologist complained that my depakote dose was too high for it not even helping, so I was eager to get off it (it was also supposed to help for migraines, which was an epic fail too). I haven\'t seen her since January of this year since she wanted to put me on lithium - not that I didn\'t want to go on it, but more or less I\'m just depressed at this point and don\'t see the need to be on such a heavy duty medicine when prozac and Zoloft worked well in the past. I also stopped seeing her since over time, she became incredibly childish when she realized that I\'m able to make my own decisions without her consent, never saw me on time, thought it was fine to schedule someone else during my appointment time, and never listened to me, so it just wasn\'t worth the hassle to keep spending time seeing her since I wasn\'t getting better under her care. \n\nI\'d like to get back on an antidepressant such as prozac or Zoloft, or maybe even symbyax. I\'m tired of going in circles not getting anywhere or better for all that matters, and I don\'t want to unalive myself, but I wouldn\'t mind not being here either.'"

""how could i feel this fucking miserable and tortured. how could i feel this powerless and abused. how could a world that ""loves"" me just rape me, scream at me, hit me, betray me and trap me if it\'s worth anything at all."" ""if god is real then he will probably send me to hell for not believing in a future with him, he will send me to hell for killing myself because i should have had more faith. i shouldnt have been so prideful, i shouldnt have doubted his plan, i should have seen the good the world has to offer etc."" ""why wouldnt he send me to hell."" sooo in my mind i figured if i take these pills and immediately tell my mom about it then maybe during the time that she rushes me to the hospital (keep in mind this was at the peak of covid and the hospitals were packed and dangerously busy) and by the time the doctors finally get to me ill probably have OD but god wouldnt consider it suicide because technically i tried to save myself by telling my mom. so i walk out of the bathroom, tell my mom i took 56 sum pills and her and her friend jumped in the car and rushed me to the hospital. in the car all i could feel was worry about if god was going to send me to hell and also relief that i might finally fucking die and never have to be here again. we get to the hospital and my mom has to leave me alone because the hospital wasnt accepting visitors because of covid. so im sitting in a wheelchair (outside because the hospital was packed) silently panicking because i began to worry about if id have a horrible seizure or if id end up brain dead and alive, all of these awful possibile outcomes start fucking with my head all while my eyes start to get heavy (it was about 30 min after i had taken the pills) , my heart is pounding, my mind is racing and i keep nodding out/trying to keep myself awake and all of the nurses and doctors were frantically working with all of the covid patients. i rememeber thinking ""fuck this was a bad time to do this because people are on the brink of death and im just here not fully comitting to this fucking ""suicide"" and basically just awaiting help like everyone else suffering around me."" i was about to die, i could feel my body being taken over by the pills and i could feel my soul screaming for help while hoping for peace after it all. i begin to worry because i was unsure of how my body would react to the pills so i start asking the nurses when they will be able to help me and they just kept saying soon. after about 15 min they finally take me inside the hospital and they tried to get me to walk somewhere but i could barely walk because of the pills and my balance was really off so they sat me on a bed in one of the main hallways and i just laid there wondering what was going to happen to me for about 20 minutes. by then i was surprised the pills hadnt completely knocked me out yet.. then i was taken into another room, then another room, then one more room where i was lying on a bed next to a few other people... i rememeber the doctor bringing me some black charcoal looking drink and told me to drink it and in between the refills i remember nodding out, the pills were starting to win and all i could think was ""i think im about to die. am i finally going to be at peace?"" my eyes couldnt stay open anymore and it was like i was just simply falling asleep but the doctors and nurses around me were rushing as if they knew the pills were going to actually kill me and i remmeber just letting myself go. i just let it all leave me. the worry, the pain, the questions... i just let it all slip away and i shut my eyes. the next thing i remmeber is waking up and seeing the nurses around me asking me if i could remember where i was and if i could remember the day but none of the answers came to me, i just sat up in the bed trying to remember where i was and what day it was and i rmemeber panicking because i couldnt remember and i was wondering if the pills had damaged my brain and if id ever remember anything again... eventually the answers slowly came except for one, i couldnt remember what day it was. the doctor just gave me more charcoal stuff to drink and eventually i came to my conscience... then they moved me to another room, let me sleep (while a nurse sat in the room with me) then when i woke up they asked if i thought i could leave the hospital or if i should be on suicide watch and i remember thinking ""what a fucking odd question to have to answer to"" and i just told them yeah i was fine and they released me the next day. then i went to rehab that i was miserable at. my suicide attempt was a relief ina way. it was like an inch closer to a peace of mind ive been yearning for endlessly. when im sad i just imagine my mind fading away into the darkness that was at one point just a moment away form a final death. the end. this was when i was 22 and im now 25. still depressed but happy that death was almost obtainable.'"

celexa,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/4qsttz/minocycline_gave_me_severe/,b'Minocycline gave me severe depersonalization/negative psychological effects',,"b'I\'m writing this post in hopes that this would benefit anyone who needs help as bad as I did. \n\n\nOctober 2015 I was prescribed minocycline after years of fighting acne. 100 mg every 12 hours. It cleared me up perfectly - face, shoulders, chest. No problems there. Although I did notice having diarrhea more frequently than usual. That was a side effect I was willing to exchange for having the clearest skin I\'d ever had.\n\n\nAround this same time I began experiencing what I thought was depression. This whole time frame was during my last year of college, where I was a soon-to-be graduate. I was under a tremendous work load doing a research thesis and there was a lot of uncertainty about my future. I thought it was normal for a college student (which it is) to undergo some depression. I felt a sense of nothingness and had serious trouble sleeping (neither of which I ever had in the past). This continued in ebbs and flows and I tried to grind my way through it in college. This, of course, came with serious consequences. I would lay in bed for hours in the dark with all the blinds closed. My health went in a downwards spiral as I didn\'t eat much or go to the gym. I destroyed my relationship with my S/O - piling everything on her like a personal therapist. I wasn\'t interested in hanging out with my friends. I was unhappy in the moments around my family that I hadn\'t seen in a long time. I got the most exciting job offer in my life, yet I was excited about it for about 20 minutes. I became distant from everyone and everything.\n\n\nWhat I noticed in particular were 2 things, which aren\'t just attributed to depression, but more so to anxiety:\n\n\n* I was always ""fending off"" the next breakdown for as long as possible, but it was inevitable.\n* There was a self-realization of mental deterioration, and this was extremely visceral. Racing thoughts like ""what the hell is happening to me?""\n* I was constantly in a state of worry, racing thoughts, and inability to have a calm state of mind.\n\n\nAfter I had broken up with my S/O *over text* (appalling) and didn\'t care at all that that was a horrible approach, refusing to communicate...finally I went in search for help. \n\n\nI saw a therapist and he and I began to rule out every possible cause of these negative feelings. Relationship, weather, workload, etc. After he brought up a possible cause of it being organic, I immediately called the dermatologist and asked if minocycline could have such effects. The doctor said that was not possible. I looked online, and people just like me were writing stories about similar experiences. Depersonalization, seemingly, is a rare side effect of this medication. \n\n\nI went to the pharmacist and requested a refill history. There was a gap in between fall and spring semesters where I wasn\'t taking this medication. I remember distinctly a time over winter break where I was crying profusely about being under stress and my career prospects. I had not cried at all (I was incapable of feeling both good and bad emotions) in these 6 months, except during that gap. \n\n\nI went off minocycline and within days I noticed improvements. I gradually began to part with anxiety like an old friend. I started to challenge myself to do new things rather than chase happiness as a feeling. A few weeks later on a road trip with my family I was beaming and talking excitedly the entire 13 hour car ride. I was finally able to cry about my relationship. Crying never felt so...*good*.\n\n\nI don\'t know if there are any credible studies about the psychological effects of minocycline, but I have good reason to believe minocycline adversely affected my mental health for about 6 months and ruined my last year of college.\n\n\nI urge you to seek help if you\'re having mental health problems. Shutting people out, as I found out the hard way, will only make things worse. There a lot of people out there who love and support you.\n\n\n'"

I should have kept better track of my results but after month 2 I was concentrating on healing than documenting. I tried to remember as much as I can and tried to include as much info as I could.\n\nThe TL;DR of this is that I was able to recover near fully (i'm still working on it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key Points**\n\nFirst off I think here are the most important things in recovering\n\n\\- Definitely have the optimism or drive to continue to discover and improve.\n\n\\- Finding positive posts like [https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/7rbrx0/a\\_much\\_needed\\_fing\\_sciatica\\_success\\_story/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/7rbrx0/a_much_needed_fing_sciatica_success_story/) can help.\n\n\\- I understand the pain can be debilitating, which is why having loved ones that support you is important.\n\n\\- Self experiment and try new things\n\n\\- Time and dont rush.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly speaking, looking at Google, it says most Sciatica resolves itself around 6 months and has greatly improved. So I'm not 100% sure if it was just time, or if it was my due diligence and stretches and exercises. I want to say that the stretches helped a lot and if i just left it alone for 6 months I wont be much better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Timeline**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAug 2018\n\n28th - Started to feel some discomfort, I dont think i did anything out of the ordinary, maybe sometimes I had to lift 50lbs or so weight but I've always lifted carefully. I think the culprit is from sitting too much. I sit in an office for 8 hours then go home and sit front of a computer for another 5-8 hours with bad posture.\n\n29th/30th - The pain worsens\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSept\n\n3rd - Started taking Ibuprofen, didn't really help\n\n4th - Started to go to the gym to stretch (this was my biggest mistake). Not because I went to the gym, but I didn't research the appropriate stretches\n\n10th - Started to use Robaxacet (didnt' really help). Started muscle relaxant and painkillers. I want to say it might have helped a bit with the relaxant and pain killers\n\n11th - From the meds I started to feel better, maybe 20-30% less pain, but once again I do not recommend this unless you really can't sleep since it is just covering up the symptoms.\n\n14th- I noticed my posture is off and my back is straight (it should have a natural arch) but it is straight.\n\n15th - Tried some THC and rested. I dont think this really helped either.\n\n17th Started to do tennis ball roll on the back, it was really painful, didn't help too much either.\n\n18th feels like i can bend and move more, sitting presses against my nerves, but i can do back lifts/extension  without issues. This is also the day where I started feeling less back pain and more in the legs. The pain is moving down to my foot.\n\n19th- Went to Athletic therapy and realizes pain worsens. This whole time the stretches I've been doing involved a lot of flexion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wqd093kj7jm21.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=af6234fbed2508666cad6fcad197bef61e0f5fae\n\nI always heard if you can touch your toes, you have a healthy back. So I continued to push myself no matter how painful it was to do the flexion exercises. However this is what damaged my back more. I gritted through the pain believing no pain no gain.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT DO THIS. This amount of pain brought tears to my eyes. Later in Nov/Dec I had my MRI and CT scan I realize in addition to sciatica, this was a herniated disc with a huge mass pushing against my spinal nerves.  So pretty much my flexion stretches pushed out that disc gel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n21st - I went to the doctors and Naproxen, but I dont believe this was strong enough to ease the pain.\n\nAt this point in time I can't walk, sit or sleep without extreme pain.\n\n21/25th- Started to try Chiropractors. I never trusted chiros and didn't believe in their work. After this entire event, I am still sticking to that. None of the cracking, or manipulation aided in the recovery. They did give me a back support belt which wasn't helpful during that time. I've used the back support belt in January- March 2019 on and off. So...there's that\n\n26th- Massage therapy, at this point the RMT wasn't too helpful, however advice of soaking in warm/hot water with epson salt (i didnt use salt though) for 15-30 minutes was a bit helpful. Im not sure how helpful, but it allowed me to relax and promote blood flow on the back. Hoping this would heal it faster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOct\n\n26th/Oct 3- tried acupuncture. I am afraid of needles and this was a painful procedure too. I can't say much about this experience. I dont think acupuncture can cure sciatica, however I do truly believe the pain it causes during the meeting releases natural pain killers ( adenosine ) this enables you focus and on resting and recovering the back. Imagine you hurt your arm and someone comes and slaps you in the face, you forget about your arm and focus on the face. This is of course temporary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring this whole time I've been going to Physio too. Keep in mind finding the right physio is crucial. I've been to a few that denied it was sciatica or gave me flexion stretches.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point I have taken (please don't mix meds! Consult your doctor if you are uncertain)\n\nNaproxen\n\nGabapentin\n\nAmittriptyline\n\nCyclobenzaprine\n\nI hate pain killers, I normally dont even take tylenol or advil. However because of the pain I was in. I had to take some for the nerve pain and some for sleep. Essentially all these meds, chiro, acupuncture, massage, physio was to get me comfortable enough to rest and sleep.\n\nI wanted to reiterate, I can barely walk, I would limp and it wouldn't be far. I can't sit at all. I would need to lie on the floor to eat, and watch tv. I can't sleep at night unless i take drugs. I've tried pillow between legs etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n12th This is when I found a physio that knew the Mackenzie method of back recovery. I did a lot of research on the Mackenzie method and thanks to  [u/ItchesForRiches](https://www.reddit.com/user/ItchesForRiches) post I was able to find a Physio that did Mackenzie. I tried to do these stretches a bit on my own but thought they were useless. Until I went to the physio and he very very methodically went through a few items and slowly introduced exercises. I'm not patient and this guy was super slow. However his exercises worked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Oct- Dec**Following exercises and customize exercise. Went to take MRI and CT scans, waited to see if I need surgery. Had the meeting in March, spoilers, I do not need surgery. Maybe back in Oct/Nov I might have been recommended surgery, but even then they can't push that gel back in, they need to cut it out, remove it, possibly even fusing my spine which would limit my back movement. So if you can, try to avoid surgery since it's not even a guarantee heal.\n\nDuring this time I essentially just continued to do the stretches like clockwork, over and over again. 3 times a day, for 3 months. Each week or two I'd notice less pain and slight improvements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the exercises\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 1 Flexion\n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bntvhnsk7jm21.png?width=240&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=229d7dba30586edadeccde3e401fb1248c121096\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxhhr7jl7jm21.png?width=240&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=21eba8d818f6072f090264a75f2d0c546d6bf426\n\n**Instructions**\n\nStand up straight with your feet together, about one foot away from a wall.Place your outermost hand on the side of your pelvis so as to apply pressure on the top of the pelvic bone.Use your hand to push your pelvis towards the wall so as to cause your back to stretch towards one side.Relax your back.PROGRESSION: Repeat with your feet further away from the wall.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** every 3 hrs | **Hold:** 5 secs | **Tempo:** glide hips to left only\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 2 Active ROM rotation\n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ys2j54hm7jm21.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f11f0a9db64b5ee27d6fcf74cded309d6a466fdd\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jkfrerfn7jm21.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9d93a5aa12b63bd5f1161bb6067f17e2e2c5a417\n\n**Instructions**\n\nLie on your back and with your knees bent and foot on the floor (crook lying).Place arms out to side for stability.Slowly lower legs to one side until you feel a gentle stretch and then to the other side.Return to neutral position and repeat.Keep your knees together during the movement.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** 3 x a day | **Hold:** 15 secs\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 3 Single knee to chest\n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7rt4ijbo7jm21.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=00e4e80f2e202b4206c965a388b20902652b9baf\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/de2m8gap7jm21.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6e005c7f71d79fa5ea7dc7497f086d6645dbc621\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Instructions**\n\nLie on your back with both knees bent, hands behind one knee.Pull the knee towards your chest slowly, release and then repeat until pain relief or as prescribed by your therapist.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** 3 x a day | **Hold:** 15 secs\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 4 Thoracic stretch\n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/73sxlk5q7jm21.png?width=240&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=09af89f032842e7da84846d814a4507830bed1de\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y2zi5uvq7jm21.png?width=240&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=04f85c381905ffbfcd0a964a179eda591b95d89d\n\n**Instructions**\n\nLie on your side with knees bent at 90.You can place a towel under the head for support.Place the bottom hand on the knees and press lightly to make sure they stay on the ground.With the top hand, reach for your ribs and pull gently as you rotate the torso.Hold the position for the required time and repeat following guidelines.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** 3 x a day | **Duration:** lay on right side only | **Hold:** 15\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 5 Passive ROM Extension\n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45wkr5ur7jm21.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f06c6095c95681c90dc726b490f007e5050be40e\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3acvoxks7jm21.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=46f994a1c9e9d13f7b8db3d62b99f6f5c71decdb\n\n**Instructions**\n\nLie on your stomach with your chin tucked-in.Place hands at approximately shoulder height and bring leg out in to a figure 4 pattern.While keeping the hips and legs on the table, press trunk upward with armswhile relaxing abdominals and buttocks.Slowly return to neutral position and repeat.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** 3 x a day | **Duration:** right leg to side | **Hold:** 2 secs\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 6 Leg glide in supported 45 \n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvhcpq0d8jm21.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f7d799560ac46b851194c763e2be668d07881d27\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u37d2wyt7jm21.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0fdee24ad26b00e8f5ea35e3057a2ce2fcfd1b0e\n\n**Instructions**\n\nLie on your back with the affected leg straight and supported in an elevated positionat a 30 to 45  angle.Pull the toes up toward you, to flex the foot on the elevated leg.

When you reach the point where you feel a pulling sensation along your leg, let go and return to the starting position and repeat.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** 3 x a day\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had pain in the lower right side, So i had a preference side. These exercise help focus on the injured side. The goal is to centralize the pain and push it from the legs back up to the lower back.\n\nWith these exercises I focused on doing this 2 to 3 times a day. 10 reps for each exercise, holding for 15 seconds each.I did this for about 2 months straight and I've been introducing my own stretches (this is where you need to experiment and find what helps).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MODIFICATIONS**\n\nFor example here were my changes (be careful since everyone is different). Do these at your own risk\n\n**1 Flexion**\n\nIn the flexion exercise, I had my pain on the right side, so I would push my hip to the left. I modified this exercise, and instead of using the wall after I got used to it, I went more extreme and stood straight up and bent without the wall hoping to bend further.\n\nWhat the flexion exercise does (at least my understanding of it) is that it sets your back straight in order for you to proceed with the other stretches.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2 Active ROM Rotation**\n\nI did this unchanged throughout the whole time until in March 2019 where i did this on the end of a couch or bed so my legs can drop further and i used my arms to pull it further down and thats when you really hear your back crack. I dont recommend this until you are almost healed since I dont know what effects it will have before then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3 Single knee to chest**\n\nI did these with double knee to chest once I felt comfortable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4 thoracic stretch**\n\nNo changes\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5 Passive Rom Extension.**\n\n**There are many variations of this i did.**\n\nA) First i followed the instructions. I believe the knee bend is to focus on the right side of your back.\n\nB1) Some modifications I did was not to bend any legs. Once you are comfortable with both of those you can try some of the other modification\n\nB2) another stretch I tried was just lying face down and fully relaxing and see if your back hurts. Try this again but with knees bent about 90 degrees, then try to tilt it to the left or right.  I use this as a test to see if there's any improvements after these modified stretches.\n\nC) I had my wife sit on my back and push down near the pelvic area, since I noticed my body lifting when I'm doing these extensions. With her keeping my pelvic on the floor i was able to stretch the back more. **This would be probably one of the more useful exercises with my wife sitting down**. It gave me more movement and less pain. I kept pushing this exercise. I felt pain, but its not like a bad pain, more like a sore pain, (hard to explain), but I was able to push more and further each time. It was hard but helpful.\n\nD1) This modification is where i had my chest and neck **on the floor** and my lower body on the ball and I've asked my wife to lift my legs and bend it towards my head, this was uncomfortable, difficult and painful. below is the closest picture I can find, i apologize for the unclear picture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mxinxkiw7jm21.png?width=183&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f861574a8c49754b1c8503f2337305e641fa5585\n\nD2) At the same time as C's I used an exercise ball (really large one, larger than the picture below) and I did the following. I lay on my back and the ball was large enough that my legs barely touching the floor. I would roll the ball back and use my arms to balance my body and let my lower body/legs dangle, fully relaxed. I would lift both legs up balancing with my arms then drop both my legs down fully relaxed to really stretch it out. (I caution when trying this, it may cause injury if done incorrectly.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kflog57f8jm21.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=04e8f093e8070c2f7623bae10908ec2ab38cd6e3\n\nE) Once my wife was on a business trip and wasn't able to aid me, I was able to conjure up another method of this stretch.  I tried the camel pose, please see below. It was too difficult for me to do. So I did this at my bed room doorway but I had a broom stick placed across the door frame and place it around my pelvic area height-wise. Then i leaned back and stretched. **This modification was another exercise that allowed me to see great improvements.** . Be careful as the broom might snap, and it did damage my door frame by rubbing some paint off. I was able to achieve great flexibility with this exercise and it helped with a lot of the pain. I would say the base exercise gets you ready and modification C and E was the most impactful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzp1m41y7jm21.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8413c97ee5a87fce687afc940977fb5320db897a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nF) After I did the broom stick stretch (above), I started to do the camel pose properly, I still can't do it, but I'm working on it. The key is to try to relax your back and let it drop.\n\nG) The final modification was similar to Step D1\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/adav58xg8jm21.png?width=183&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=30d3eb94e5022d0dff0e6a1b9b9ebfed82d5eceb\n\nWhere instead of a ball i rested my legs on a couch and would try to let my body reach the ground. The key is let your back fully relax and drop. this is hard to explain, but try to be as limp as possible. I tried placing my upper body on the floor and letting it droop and relax and breathe in and out to make sure it gets a full natural stretch.\n\nI found that the stretches in the earlier stages used more muscles to force you into that position, but i still felt there could be improvements from the pain. I am still doing this exercise till this data (march 2019). I let everything relax and let my legs rest on the couch and i feel the tightness, and soreness on the back. This allowed me to slowly stop using the back support belt when sitting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**step 6 and 7 in the physio guide**\n\nI didn't really do them since i was in too much pain, and when i started to mod my stretches, i was able to move more, and flexibility and strength came back and didn't require to do these at all. But if you find them helpful, please continue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Jan- Feb**\n\nRest with minimal stretches . At this point there is some discomfort and would hurt if i sat too long or took too big of a step, too sudden of a movement. But during this period I would say i have had major improvements after the 3 months of constant stretching and testing. My right leg muscles have atrophied but I slowly started walking and doing more which built it back up.\n\nAlso during this time, Not sure if I got lazy or if i found resting at this point made some improvements. I tend to have rested a lot and stretched twice a week, down from 3 times a day.\n\nI also used back support belt when sitting since sitting still gave pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**March**\n\nStarted to feel even better and do not require a back support belt. I did further Customized stretches. Which I explained above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAt this point, there is still a bit discomfort when sitting too long, but thats about it. I'm trying to continue these stretches to make sure my back is nice and flexible. I haven't tried to lift anything too heavy with my back yet. I will naturally ease into this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Take aways from**\n\nChiro - not helpful, the belt was a bit helpful during Jan/Feb.\n\nPhysio- Find the right one that knows what they are talking about, do your own research\n\nAcupuncture - Good way to divert the pain and numb it and allows you to rest and for you to do other things such as stretch and sleep.\n\nMassage Therapist - Not too helpful, but got the idea of soaking in hot/warm water to promote blood flow and recovery\n\nDoctor - gives drugs out, those can help you sleep, but I would recommend try to minimize this. The less drugs you have the more you are able to determine what you need to do to improve instead of just numbing the pain.\n\nSpine assessment clinic - too late for surgery.\n\nStretches - Test, experiment, be careful, know your limit, have someone there helping you if you need.customize on what makes you feel better. But do educated research so you aren't injuring yourself more\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: clarified the meds on the post."""

NAD.\n\nI wrote in r/eesti about my success in getting our equivalent of the NHS to apply a little-known clause in its bylaw. They covered my sedation for wisdom tooth extractions because I have sometimes had difficulties getting fully numb with local and require more local than is normal. Here sedation dentistry is virtually unknown of, even if they dig around in your jawbones for an hour. Some clinics offer sedation and our equivalent of NHS has to cover it in quite a few situations... but most patients don\'t know about sedation at all, doctors don\'t know when it should be covered and wanting sedation is considered extra. It\'s usually reserved for people with severe developmental disabilities.\n\nI\'m so proud that I pestered the clinics, our equivalent of the NHS and finally even our ministry of social affairs - and not just because I saved some money. I created a useful precedent for patients who can\'t have their teeth extracted without sedation. And I contributed to normalising sedation for dental surgery. I know someone who unlike me can\'t get numb at all and he had his wisdom teeth pulled awake. That\'s barbaric and I\'m doing my best to inform the other patients about their options.\n\nI assume that the nuances of our medical bureaucracy are of little interest to most English-speking readers, but my original post that started as a guide to the bureaucracy got a bit out of hand, and I also wrote about my experience with sedation and recovery. So I decided to translate those parts of my post for the benefit of other highly sensitive patients. A few redditors who are considering extractions seemed to appreciate the level of detail.\n\nSorry for any awkward grammar. If you find some particularly egregious error, I\'d love if you point it out since I\'m trying to improve :)\n\nThis post is long. Even by my standards. I think all of my posts in r/eesti have gotten at least one more or less snarky comment about their length. I want to write about my experience as honestly and vividly as I can.\n\nIf you know someone who has been putting off extracting their problematic wisdom teeth due to abnormally high pain sensitivity or bad dentist experiences then maybe my post can help them get it done while avoiding unpleasant issues during recovery.\n\nI have split this post into two parts - my experience with sedation, and other tips for abnormally sensitive people. I also started both parts with a TLDR and have tried to use some bold font to make it a bit more readable.\n\n**MY EXPERIENCE WITH SEDATION**\n\n**TLDR:** I read that some patients have success with oral anxiolytics or laughing gas but concluded that those aren\'t a good fit and I should go with IV sedation. There was nothing physically unpleasant about sedation and the recovery was quick but waking up under the influence of drugs in a white room with stitches in your mouth can result in some major panic. I do think that sedation was the only reasonable option for me and I would have really regretted doing the operation awake.\n\nI briefly considered an oral anxiolytic. My GP prescribed me alprazolam (Xanax) for dental visits and I used it for the last two fillings. It turned out that the effects of alprazolam on me, at least in the small doses I have tried, are a big fat nothing. I do hope that a more substatial dose or a different drug might help. I\'ll ask my GP or a psychiatrist to help find the right drug and dosage that would take the edge off during normal dental visits. But something as serious and potentially painful as a wisdom tooth extraction is not the time to experiment with a drug that MIGHT eliminate SOME of the problems.\n\nSome clinics offer both laughing gas and IV sedation. I strongly preferred the second option since I\'ve read that IV sedation is better if the patient has extreme anxiety and laughing gas can cause nausea and a headache, especially if you have to breathe it for a whole hour. Fortunately it turned out that my clinic employs only IV sedation.\n\nSedation is much easier than GA. They don\'t intubate you, you breathe independently with a bit of supplemental oxygen that is given non-invasively via some tubing under your nose. I was explained that unlike with GA I won\'t be given any drugs that can cause vomiting after the operation. So if you\'ve heard bad stories about coming out of GA or experienced it for yourself - sedation is different.\n\nDoctors sure are weird. They seemed very invested in making me look away during IV insertion and warned that the drug will burn. Considering why I was there, those seemed to be the least of my problems.\n\nI don\'t remember anything from the moment the IV was inserted and I felt a slight burn and pleasant warmth in my hand. **Going to sleep happened in a couple of seconds and felt very comfy.** I\'ve read that some patients have some fuzzy bits of memories since it\'s not GA, but most aren\'t bothered by it.\n\n**The physical and cognitive part of waking up was easy.** I felt no nausea whatsoever. For the first few minutes I didn\'t feel any pain except the pinch of my IV being removed. I don\'t remember any confusion. My thinking cleared very quickly. When the anesthesiologist was talking to the surgeon and recommended ibuprofen for postop pain I asked whether it\'s safe to take etoricoxib and ibuprofen together since they\'re both cyclooxygenase inhibitors. (The nerd is strong in this one.) When they made me stand up I almost passed out. I started lowering myself towards the floor, and then someone offered me an office chair and wheeled me to the recovery room.\n\nThe psychological part of waking up was a whole other story. **I was crying like crazy even before my pain sensitivity returned.** I woke up in complete panic - I wasn\'t confused or unresponsive, I understood very well what was going on and could hold a reasonable conversation between sobs, but I was extremely afraid and irritated. That happens, especially in younger people, women and those with a history of medical procedure trauma. You shouldn\'t be ashamed, it\'s not under your control. And it\'s certainly nothing compared to what would have happend if I hadn\'t chosen sedation. I\'m mentioning it just so you don\'t have any unpleasant surprises and so that you are kind to yourself if it happens.\n\nOne redditor who has anxiety was put off by this description and it might have influenced him against sedation. **If you are an easy crier or are traumatised by medical procedures you might want to ask if they can wake you up with a family member or friend present** \\- someone\'s got to drive you home anyways. It\'s much harder to tailspin into a panic attack if someone you love is holding your hand and knows what are the right things to tell you when you feel bad. (Telling me to calm down only makes me cry more!)\n\nStill, to reassure you, everything about sedation - except the condescending and irritable attitude of the surgeon, which made the panic attack so much worse - is something that I wouldn\'t be afraid to repeat if it was necessary. Going to sleep was very pleasant. Waking up (when considered separately from postop ick like blood in your mouth and pain - which you would experience anyways) wasn\'t as bad as I expected.\n\nThe fact that sedation is normal in the US for wisdom tooth extractions, and not only for special needs patients, should tell you how safe it is. The fact that here most patients suffer it awake unlike in the US is purely a question of cultural norms and money, not risks.\n\nBy the way, the awful pain a few minutes after waking up tells me that the local failed partially and **doing the operation awake with my history would have been the dumbest idea ever.** Keep in mind that a tooth extraction is difficult to stop once the tooth is broken. If you have any doubts about your ability to let the doctor finish the job while you\'re awake, demand sedation.\n\n**ON CHOOSING THE DOCTOR; ON POSTOP PAIN AND RECOVERY**\n\n**TLDR:** You might be the 1% who can\'t handle it without prescription painkillers and extends your sick leave well into the second week. Speak up before the operation and not when you are already feeling awful and it hurts to speak. Don\'t trust the doctor if they promise to handle pain as it happens and refuse to discuss it preemptively.\n\nThose tips are especially important for a highly sensitive patient. There are things the docs don\'t tell you because, after all, every patient is a statistical average. And the internet is a great evil because if a patient doesn\'t read about the bad experiences they might not notice if it happens to them. \\\\s\n\n\\- **Don\'t take it lightly.** It\'s an hour of digging around in your jawbones and not removing a mole. Recovery can be long and painful even if the operation goes ideally, like mine. Nerve damage can be serious and sometimes, rarely, permanent. Nerve damage can mean a numb lip or tongue, changes in taste perception or even chronic pain. Two of my wisdom teeth had to go because one was trying to grow into the root of the neighboring tooth under a 45-degree angle and the other was a gum infection risk. If some of your wisdom teeth have come in nicely and don\'t hurt, and extraction is recommended only because poor hygiene might result in a cavity ten years later or your orthodontist wants more space to work with, then I\'d seriously ask yourself if it\'s worth so much pain. And don\'t expect the doctor to warn you about the risks adqeuately. The surgeon described the possibility of nerve damage as ""might pull out some nerve fibers"" and if I hadn\'t read up on the internet then I wouldn\'t know what it actually means. I had a successful operation and my IAN is completely intact. But you might have bad luck. I know that in the age of vaccine skepticism and the ivermectin craze this phrase might sound off to some, but still - **do your research.**\n\n\\- **If you decide to do it awake then listen to your gut when consulting with the doc.** Several reviews about teeth pulled without sufficient numbing, treating sedation or an extended sick leave as some kind of a whim and not a necessity, a sour mien if you\'re worried and ask reasonable questions, and an irrational fear of prescription painkillers are all red flags. Considering how the surgeon was talking to me while I was waking up and how she refused to treat my pain, pulling the teeth while awake would have been a terrifying experience. She might be skillful and I\'m glad she saved my IAN during a complicated extraction but in all other respects being treated by her was an experience that undid much of the work I\'d done on my fear thanks to my excellent new dentist.\n\n\\- **Don\'t let them extract teeth from both sides at the same time** unless you want to eat baby food and yogurt for a month and skip candied almonds for one more month. I\'m glad that I decisively refused the surgeon\'s suggestion to pull the third tooth just in case. The side that was operated on might hurt and be useless for a long time. One non-damaged side speeds up the return to a reasonable diet so much.\n\n\\- **Consider the possibility of a longer recovery when you\'re picking the time.** Don\'t assume that if someone you know took two ibuprofen and resumed work the next day then you will too. Keep in mind that your face might look swollen or bruised for a week and speaking even for a very short time might hurt a lot for the first few days. If you are a student, an instructor or a grown-up who has signed up for some fun course then don\'t get your teeth extracted in the middle of the term hoping that you\'ll recover in a couple of days. And don\'t get your teeth extracted less than two weeks before a party that you would be sorry to miss. **I\'m very much disappointed in my stupidity - I assumed that I would be able to go to a concert three days after the operation.** \\#NotAStatisticalAverage\n\n\\- **It\'s better to get it done in the first half of the working week** \\- especially if you\'re optimistic and agree to do it without a preemptive prescription for stronger painkillers. It\'s nice if for the first two or three days you can reach your surgeon or GP by phone at least during daytime. This might spare you a visit to the ER.\n\n\\- **Take sick leave, if you can. As much as you need.** I know that it\'s often challenging or impossible in the US but if it\'s possible, use your sick leave! A code rat doesn\'t deserve any less sick leave than a warehouse worker or a teacher. Be prepared to argue with a doctor or a rude front desk nurse who thinks otherwise. No one should be working in so much pain, even if they can WFH. Mental strain and stress don\'t pull on your incisions but they certainly can make you feel worse. And rest can help you use less painkillers - tell this if a family member or a healthcare worker dares to question your need for a longer sick leave. #NotAStatisticalAverage\n\n\\- **Premedication.** I was given 0.5 g tylenol when I arrived. I should have laughed and told them that I might as well take nothing. If you know from experience that 0.5 g is completely useless for you and you take 1 g even for minor issues or that ibuprofen works better for you or actually you\'d like to take both just in case, then don\'t hesitate to speak up. My second panic attack and a long bout of crying happened in the recovery room just after sedation wore off completely and I understood how much pain I\'m in.\n\n\\- **I was still in an awful amount of pain the next day and the surgeon refused to help me.** I had a prescription COX-2 inhibitor (and I\'m not sure if it did any good - discontinuing it a few days later didn\'t affect my pain much) and OTC tylenol with codeine and ibuprofen. At first those were completely insufficient even when taken all together in maximum doses. I was in so much pain that I couldn\'t drink much water, go to sleep or speak. I took the maximum safe amount of ibuprofen together with the COX-2 inhibitor and because I couldn\'t eat even a decent amount of ice cream I took ibuprofen on an almost empty stomach. (Not a good idea!) You should also consider that the recovery isn\'t linear and you might get some surprisingly nasty pain as a surprise several days later - and Murphy\'s law suggests that it will happen in the evening or on the weekend. **Does your surgeon claim that no one needs opioids for such a ""minor"" thing? That opioids make you drowsy and most patients hate it so much that you shouldn\'t even give it a try? That they will prescribe something stronger but only after the operation, if the need actually arises? RUN.** Don\'t trust that you will get help when you need it. My boyfriend called the surgeon. (I was too sore to speak.) The surgeon told me to meditate and claimed that OTC painkillers aren\'t helping because I don\'t believe in their effectiveness. Fortunately my GP prescribed me tramadol. After I got the pain under control, drank some water and slept the milder painkillers worked much better. Also, while pain isn\'t ""all in your head"" I must admit that having tramadol on hand wasn\'t just good for pain and sleep, it was also a psychological safety blanket that allowed me to cope. I took as little as possible and discontinued it as soon as possible, used less than three pills total and split them, but it was nice having it on my nightstand and thinking ""Yes, it sucks a bit right now. But if it starts sucking more, I can take something stronger anytime I want."" Everybody should know their risks of addiction. Some have an unhealthy attraction to psychoactive stuff, some don\'t. I don\'t. For me, tramadol was very effective against pain and discomfort, that\'s all. Everyone\'s different. #NotAStatisticalAverage\n\n\\- **The best thing you can do to stay comfortable while minimising the use of painkillers and reducing their use as quickly as possible is lots of good sleep.** During the day moderate pain can be ignored with distractions. And you actually want to keep at least a bit of pain during the day to remind you to avoid anything stupid that might disturb the incisions or pull out the blood clot. But that works best if you aren\'t tired and angry after a miserable, sleepless night. If you get your pain fully under control late in the evening and sleep well then next day you\'ll be rested and in a good mood and the total use of painkillers will be greatly reduced.\n\n\\- **If you had a bad experience then ask to book your postop checkup, if you need one, with a different dentist.** My clinic was very understanding about it. The dental surgeon who checked my wounds did his best to not cause any unnecessary pain during the checkup and so graciously kept to himself all the frustrated comments about my sensitivity that were probably going through his head.\n\n\\- Your wound might feel iffy and you might be unsure if it\'s just your hypersensitivity or an infection that requires more antibiotics. **The checkup is another reason why you might need a stronger painkiller.** I timed tylenol, ibuprofen and tramadol so that they all peaked during the checkup. That was sufficient to open my mouth enough to show the wounds. Barely. Nine days after the operation. #NotAStatisticalAverage\n\n\\- The doctor I visited for the checkup suggested flushing the wound. I asked if I can have numbing. He warned that when the tissue is irritated the local doesn\'t work as well. I asked what happens if we don\'t flush the wound. He explained that I don\'t have serious inflammation and the wound will heal, just slower. Because even inspecting the wound hurt despite the doctor\'s best efforts, and caused me to make some funny faces and undignified sounds, I decided that I\'d rather take ibuprofen and avoid chewing on that side a few days longer than let him flush the wound. **If the doctor suggests flushing the wound and you are afraid of it then ask what happens if you don\'t. Maybe it\'s ok to leave as is.** I\'m glad that the doc was honest and took into consideration my sensitivity and not only what would be medically ideal if the patient had a high pain tolerance.\n\n\\- **Please, give feedback**. To the doctor - make them think. To the clinic, as they might want to know if one of their doctors ticked the patient off so much that they\'re badmouthing the place to everyone who will listen. And to the wider public, **because we all deserve not just competent but humane medical treatment.**\n\nTo those who read this chonker of a text to the end - thank you for reading my manifesto about dental care. Know your limits. Don\'t be afraid to ask doctors to employ reasonable and safe accommodations that help you take care of your physical health without causing psychological trauma. Have higher expectations when it comes to bedside manner and both procedural and postoperative pain! You will be helping not only yourself but other patients as well.'"

This has been great for my family life and for me personally, but for the past 6 months or so Ive been pretty upset about the weight gain that comes along with it. \nMy Dr is aware that weight is a concern and has worked with me to keep my meds weight neutral. Despite that Ive gained about 44 lbs over the past year. The first 6 months after starting Zoloft I gained a bit of weight, maybe 10 lbs. I was no longer suffering from crippling anxiety and depression so some weight gain was to be expected on my part. The past 6 months Ive been very aware of the weight and despite my best efforts Im unable to stop gaining but have managed to slow it down to roughly 5lbs a month. Since I am finally mentally healthy and stable Im unwilling to completely starve myself or get into some obsessive workout routine which is what I would have done in the past. My go to is low carb but that is no longer working the way it has in the past. My Dr has done bloodwork to rule out any other causes and has found nothing, though I did just request another one just to be sure before asking to change or stop my meds. \nThis is so unfair and its really getting me down. Last December I felt as if I couldnt continue living, and Im finally feeling better than I have pretty much ever (while not actually in some mania induced illusion of feeling amazing.) \nA little while ago I decided to go back to a mostly vegetarian clean diet in hopes that may help at least curb the constant increase. \n\nMy current prescriptions are Zoloft, lamotrigine and Wellbutrin. I have been off of antipsychotics for about a year and a half with no issues and my mood stabilizer dosage has been cut in half. My goal is to take the absolute minimum over time. When searching this sub I found topiramate, Effexor, Prozac, naltrexone, phentermine to mention to my pdoc at the end of the month as possible alternates or drugs to add for now.\nTheres really nobody I can talk to about this. My husband is normally very supportive but after our success with low carb it is his go-to. Because of lamotrigine the diet no longer works for me even with a healthy calorie deficit. By nature Im a small person and have been my entire life. For my height a healthy and ideal weight is probably about 110. People find it hard to take me seriously when I complain about gaining weight, but Im currently 150lbs+ and its pretty clear that there is a big problem. A priority of mine is med compliance because my mental health is very important to me but this has honestly begun to be so utterly depressing that I can no longer really feel good.'"

I feel like Ive looked into most probable causes and come up empty. \n\nHeres what Ive looked into:\n\n- Weight: Im in the healthy BMI range (510, 160 pounds, female, 29). \n- Thyroid testing: my results said I have healthy and typical thyroid function. \n- Blood tests: these came back normal without any causes for concern. \n- Exercise: I leisurely walk almost daily and do cardio for half an hour 3x a week. No strength training. \n- Diet: I eat fairly healthy 80% of the time, indulge the other 20% of the time. I eat 12-7pm and dont eat late. I rarely drink soda, and I dont drink caffeine. I never have alcohol (cant stand the taste). \n- Healthy Habits: I dont smoke cigarettes or vape. I dont take any (recreational) drugs. I meditate frequently, read daily, like to watch TV, and have no problem relaxing. \n- Relationships: I have a small but close circle of friends. I have a great relationship with my husband and an incredibly supportive, close family. \n- Stress: I have an average to low amount of stress. \n- Job: I generally like my work even though its not perfect. I work 8:30am-5pm. I get along with my coworkers. My role and my office environment are low-stress. \n- Oversleep/naps: I dont sleep more than 8-9 hours on weekdays (11pm to 7/8am). I dont nap during the week. \n- Sleep schedule: I nearly always fall asleep and wake up at the same time Monday through Friday. I dont think I carry any sleep debt into Saturday and Sunday. \n- Sleep quality: Every app Ive tried, and my Apple watch, tell me my sleep quality is 90% or higher. \n- Sleep study: Ive taken one sleep study on-site at a sleep center. I was told my sleep was normal and restful. The only piece they mentioned was I talk sometimes (husband can confirm). They said I definitely dont have obstructive sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or hypoventilation syndrome. \n- Sleep environment: I sleep in a dark, quiet, cool room free of distractions. No screens, I charge my phone in another room and there isnt a TV in my bedroom. I use an actual alarm clock. I keep the fan on for subtle background noise. My husband is a restful sleeper. We have a comfortable and supportive mattress, high-quality pillows, and cotton sheets. The only things I do in my room are sleep and intimacy with my husband. \n- Sleep apps: before I took my phone out of my room at night, I tried the ones that record your sleep then wake you up at an optimal time. Its supposed to be according to your circadian rhythm and where you are in your REM cycle. \n- Mental health: I have very mild depression that Im getting treated for and doesnt hugely affect my daily life. It was tougher and more severe in my early twenties but Ive been managing it well for awhile now. \n- Medical conditions: I have no other known medical conditions and havent had any serious or recent injuries. \n- Medication: Im on 20mg of Celexa (depression) and 50mg of Spironolactone (adult acne) daily. I havent noticed any difference before these and have been on them for years. \n- Water: I drink a lot of water during the day but cut myself off around 8pm. I usually get up to go to the bathroom once a night.\n- Sleep conditions: I dont meet any of the criteria for these (according to my doctor). \n\nWhat I dont do well:\n- Waking up at the same time every day, meaning the weekends. I almost always go to bed at the same time (11pm) but I let myself wake up naturally most weekdays. This is usually between 12 and 2pm. \n- Naps: I often fall asleep later on in the day on weekends. They range from 30 minutes to 3 hours. I have no problem falling asleep at night despite this. \n\nMiscellaneous Information:\nI dont have trouble waking up most of the time. I feel refreshed and restored upon waking. Throughout the day, I often start to feel tired and sleepy. I have no problem focusing though. \n\nSince childhood, Ive always craved more sleep. I started noticing wanting to sleep this much when I was around 18. My sister has been diagnosed with Idiopathic Hypersomnia, which I dont meet quite a bit of the criteria for. I dont know of any other sleep conditions in my family. \n\nIf you made it this far, thank you.

Our system\'s founding was covered in detail in a very interesting book by university of california\'s sociologist Brown, 1979, ""Rockefeller Medicine Men"".\n\n\nThe unpopular opinion is that these corporate interests needed an effective health care system in the beggining if the 20th century, to people their factories and to fight wars, and now they don\'t. Simply put, the present system is shitty by design.\n\n\nAnother unpopular opinion: The only way for physicians to fight their way out of this mess is to reject evidence-based medicine. Why? All physicians hate insurance companies, HMOs, and giant healthcare management corporations, in short all the economic and political institutions that control them and medicine. Yet many physicians accept their own guidelines and their interpretation of.physiology from these very institutioms without question, in the form of ""evidence-based medicine"" and ""gold standards"". When you try to demonstrate alternative interpretations of data, physicians who are deciebed bybthis catchy and good-sounding phrase preemptorily cut off any productive dialogue, saying ""i believe in evidence-based medicine"". As if physicians from previous eras said ""we reject and disdain evidence and science"". The whole motto ""evidence-based medicine"" is preposterous. What ""evidence-based medicine"" means practically is a uniform belief in the mandates and models that these hated institutions impose upon physicians. It means a diminution of the physician\'s sovereignty.\n\nSome guidelines are good, some bad, but if you\'ve made it past my polemic introduction, my point is that it should be up to physicians to decide things for themselves.  Doctors do other doctors a disservice when they criticize them for any minor straying from, or questioning of, such dogma as that produced by the instutions of medicine that are cursed in one breath and praised in the next. More physicians need to understand that their guidelines and interpretations of physiology come from the same institutions that are continually failing physicians now in the present crisis; And every scientific medical doctor should recognize that criticism and disagreement are absolute requisites for any true scientific progress.Unless individual physicians offer something more valuable to the patient than the institutions and health care systems, the trajectory of our system will inevitably continue its downard trend. I think everyone here would agree that, with regards to the current crisis, the bar has been set very low. \n\n\nWhat is one example of mistaken physiology? Heart disease and cholesterol. Hypercholesterolemia used to be a cardinal sign of hypothyroidism. Low testosterone is associated with heart disease. Thyroid hormone, t3, stimulates steroidogensis of cholesterol into testsosterone, which radioactive tracing has demonstrated collects in the heart, protecting that muscle. T3 has this hypocholerolemic action; t4 doesn\'t (unless well converted into t3). Do physicians today rule out hypothyroidism before prescribing statins? Is that in the ""gold standard"" guidines? T3 is said to be bad for the heart but at low doses, for example 1mcg/hour, it can rapidly reduce creatine kinase after MI. Those MI patients with lower t3 have worse outcomes. Hypocholesterolemia is a neglected and dangerous finding, made much more common by use of statins. Hypocholesterolemia is an independent predictor of mortality in ICU. Low t3 syndrome is also very common in the ICU and low t3 is similarly a predictor of mortality. If you say, without investigating, ""well that could be but there\'s not enough information"" then you\'ve surrendered your agency as a physician.This system is but one example, more can be found at the end of this essay, and should be fairly considered.\n\n\nPhysicians are trained to prefer multi-million dollar RCTs, which are often only published if the findings benefit the interests of drugmakers- the same drug makers who conceal the toxicity of their drugs every year. There are definitely some good drugs, but they are not used rationally, and many toxic drugs with no benefit are used. \n\n\nI see many physicians complain on here, about administrators, about corporations, about insurance companies, and i hate all those things as well. Every normal person hates these entities. But many on here also complain about patients, complain about other physicians because they don\'t practice ""mainstream"". Such physicians who are so chided, making their own judgements about physiology or therapies or clincical situations, who understand that big science has as much obfuscation and danger as big medicine or big anything, are the only people that can possibly save this field (and may I add their patients). All other physicians are peasants complaining about politicians, but those who see the situation clearly and act intelligently. \n\nIf every physician is a scientist, then they must be their own scientist, and form their own conclusions. Therefore ""evidence-based medicine"" is the enemy of any truly scientific physician. Certain forms of studies may be better than others, but that fact must be tempered by one\'s understanding of the political and economic forces that comprise contemporary medicine and one\'s understanding of physiology. Don\'t throw out proven physiology because it\'s old, and a new drug depends on invalidating or calling into question established principles. Why should drug companies, or those who can afford RCTs be the only ones able to challenge physiology? To throw out old evidence simply because it\'s old is unscientific; if reproducible, old evidence should be given as much weight.\n\n\nPhysicians must obtain and use better information. They must find it themselves and not rely on institutions, algorithmic medicine, or guidelines, unless those guidelines be demonstrably rational. And they must form independent practices with such information as they obtain. These are the only measures that can oppose the continued decay of the system. Patients must come to expect more than what our health care systems currently delivers. Only then will physicians regain power.\n\n\nReferences:\n\nHttps://actamedica.org/index.php/actamedica/article/view/4\nHttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24157158/\nhttps://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/901504\n\nAn introduction to counterculture physiology, or rather the mainstream physiology of the early industrial medical system.

What just happened to me?'",,"b'Today I was accidentally sleeping in without knowing. I woke up multiple times but always immediately went back to sleep for some reason. I don\'t know. I can\'t remember, especially after some kind of attack?\n\nFor context, my mom was absolutely furious to find me sleeping instead of attending class, despite the fact that this is college and not every class has mandatory attendance, including this one. Usually I\'m fine with that - I\'ve dealt with it for 19 years of my life - but this time she was yelling a lot louder than I\'ve ever heard before, ranting longer than she usually does about this. I should have been fine cause my dad did the same thing around two years ago, ironically also due to me having an abnormal sleep schedule, and I handled it pretty well.\n\nFor this time I don\'t know what was happening. For some reason my face and hands felt extremely cold. I\'m pretty sure now it\'s just blood leaving my hands and face, which has never actually happened to me before. I was constantly fighting with my vision (???) during this time, just making sure the black dots didn\'t consume my entire sight. I was also feeling like I was going to vomit. I wasn\'t nauseous by any means, somehow, and my mouth wasn\'t dry, more like.. rubbery? It was weird, and I don\'t know if I just wasn\'t allowing myself to feel certain emotions at the time but I wasn\'t feeling anxious. Is it normal to not feel anxious when you\'re anxious?\n\nTo add on, I felt like something was going to come out, and trying to make sure that I could see and at the same time making sure I wasn\'t going to vomit and on top of that just making sure I\'m listening to my mom and responding when she needs me to respond was just this experience where all I can do is internally scream that I want to lay down (?). I don\'t know. Someone help me figure out why I wanted to lay down so badly\n\nI also wonder if it\'s a separate thing from what happened with my dad. I didn\'t get that when my dad did the exact same thing (caught me oversleeping, yelled way louder and more furiously than he usually does, then let me finally get to class), but I did kind of get a long-term sleep problem. Suddenly I couldn\'t nap. I use to sneak in naps when I could to regain any sleep I lost and now I couldn\'t. Now I have certain times that I feel ""safe"" to sleep in, and can\'t fall asleep if I know someone is walking around upstairs. So I wonder if this weird.. attack (still don\'t know if it\'s an anxiety or panic attack or if it\'s even related to anxiety at all. I never felt anxious!) is just an extension of it or if it\'s a completely different response. What\'s weird to me is when my dad did it, I just stared at him in the eyes and felt extremely numb, while this time I was literally trying to suppress whatever bodily response I was getting. Both times I didn\'t feel anxious, but I don\'t think I\'ve ever had an event where so much blood left my face it felt like I stuck it in the fridge for 10 minutes straight, or the feeling of throwing up without the dizzy nausea warning me beforehand. Ironically, thinking about my mom being more angry than I\'ve ever seen before triggers the same reaction, except my feet also get cold. It\'s kind of cool actually, the way I can be in control of this response. Though I\'m a bit scared next time my entire vision is going to black out and I\'m gonna accidentally faint when I\'m getting yelled at, partly because I\'ve never fainted before (I\'ve gotten close a few times) and partly because it\'ll just be more ammo for my parents to use (stuff like telling me ""this is why you fainted"" even if the doctor says something completely different, or ""I can\'t get mad at you or you\'re just going to faint"" while they\'re shaming me)\n\nI will say though the few times I have gotten close to fainting suddenly my anxiety just goes away as well? Like I have a fear of needles, and I remember there was this one time where I was required to take two shots, and they asked me if I wanted to take both on the same day or one that day and one a later day in the form of a ""yes/no"" question. I said no, and I don\'t know if I answered it wrong or if my mom told the doctor in Viet to bring it in anyways cause next thing you know I see another vaccine tray and because I didn\'t have enough time to mentally prepare my anxiety just shot up, plus the fact I was already anxious beforehand made it so I really didn\'t have enough energy left. Doctor noticed I gone white after the shot was administered and I said I was feeling fine and that I was just seeing colorful dots floating around. Just suddenly super calm when I started getting symptoms of fainting. So maybe I was anxious and for some reason when I\'m running out of energy I just.. stop feeling anxious, while also being anxious if that made any sense.\n\nAnyways, the one coping mechanism that calms me down is seeking as much information about my problems as possible, and I don\'t think this situation is going to screw me over if I overanalyze, so hopefully I get some answers here.'"

Im not sure what caused such severe scarring on my forehead but it was around this time that it started to get bad.\n\nMy family struggled financially and my mom couldnt afford to keep up with the expenses of treatments and products especially since it seemed to be worsening my skin with scarring and not solving the acne issue.\n\nThroughout my teen years I managed it, but its always followed me. Around 19 I started to develop horrible cystic acne. I went to another dermatologist and was put on accurate. It was the only thing that ever made my skin clear and improved the appearance of my scars. Unfortunately I developed GI issues and had other side effects, causing me to quit usage after 3 months.\n\nIm now almost 29 and Im at a complete loss. Ive tried many different ingredients and topicals and my skin is extremely sensitive. \n\nFor the past year, the routine that my dermatologist has me on is Vanicream gentle cleanser, Tret, Vanicream daily hydration moisturizer and spf (I use Supergoop glow screen because its the only thing that doesnt break me out.) She also recommended 2-3 sessions of Diamond Glow facial. I did my first Diamond Glow a month ago and it didnt seem to do much of anything. The esthetician went over my lips during the facial and now my lips have been constantly peeling on the top and bottom. They also swelled up one day like they were reacting to something. My dermatologist said she thinks I have lip excema. Needless to say, I dont really care to do another Diamond Glow. \n\nIm at a loss and am looking for other opinions on what the best path / treatment plan is for my skin. Ive had no luck finding people who struggle with similar forehead scarring and any possible treatment. I should also note that I do not pick at or touch active acne besides throwing on a pimple patch, my skin just scars incredibly easily. What are your thoughts?'"

This post will be the longest, because I need to first share my story. If you struggle with cystic acne, hypertension or mental health issues, this post might be of interest to you.\n\nBackground:\n  \nAbout three years ago, I stopped using the birth control pill Reclipsen because of environmental reasons. I was obtaining my environmental studies undergraduate degree at the time and had learned about the feminization of frogs in our ecosystem due to the over abundance of endocrines in our water systems. (This over-abundance is due to more people taking birth control coupled with the municipal water systems\' inability to filter out endocrines). Additionally, I have ADD and narcolepsy, in which I struggle to remember to take BC pills each day. The allure of a non-hormonal, mindless Paragaurd (AKA copper IUD) seemed like an appropriate method of birth control for me at the time. \n\n\nMy Observed Relationship between Acne and Birth Control, Plus Stimulants:\n \nI started taking Reclipsen at age 16 and took it for about ten years in total. When I stopped using Reclipsen, I did feel less depressed initially, but all the sudden I had terrible acne (a whole different reason to spur depression)!! Being that I started taking the pill at age 16 prior to being fully out of puberty, I was not aware of the cystic acne that runs in my family. And as previously mentioned, I have ADD and narcolepsy, for which I am treated with stimulants (dextramphetamine/adderol). Anyone who uses stimulants knows \nthat it can cause patients to have extreme skin sensitivity; therefore, I have a problem, although very ashamed to admit, in which I am tempted to pick at skin imperfections. That\'s a whole other thing probably related to anxiety, and I\'ve been using some behavioral therapy techniques to curb that bad habit. But, it\'s relevant to this post, because it caused a lot of my acne cysts to be worse than they should have been, had I not picked at them. I probably caused some undue infections. Nonetheless, as a patient receiving stimulant treatment, to me an acne cyst is actually anxiety causing and caused actual physical pain. I am really sensitive to the pressure that builds within an acne cyst. I am not sure if everyone suffering from cystic acne feels this way or if it moreso a symptom of my skin sensitivity. I\'m curious to know if the average cystic acne patient feels similar symptoms, please comment on this.\n\nAfter about six months of living life with cystic acne, terrible cramps, a heavy week-long periods, I was over the natural approach to birth control and ready to forgoe my noble environmental ethics. I tried to switch to the hormonal IUD called Merina, but the doctors wouldn\'t let me. I had hypertension (high blood pressure). This is also hereditary.\n\nLet me interject and tell you NO, it\'s not the stimulants that caused hypertension. I know this because I worked with my psychiatrist for months, took a $2000 sleep study and confirmed that it was a hereditary thing. I have nearly 100% English ancenstry that can be traced back to the 1300s, so I feel like there\'s definitely some bad genes at fault somewhere along that lineage. I don\'t know much about geneology, but I assume it\'s like pure breed dogs (pure breeds always have the worst health problems as compared to muts).\n \n\nAdmittedly, I had gained about 15 pounds over the course of the following two years. I think this way due to just being faced with common life struggles such as not being happy with the job I had at that time, dating an alcoholic at that time, and yeah, constantly \nthinking about the disgusting cystic acne plaguing my face.I finally decided to break up with my boyfriend after 2.5 years of dating and moved to Chicago for a summer internship in a new field of work. I had the time of my life that summer and finally was able to shed those 15 pounds, which allowed me to go off Lisinopril (the hypertension medication). \n\nBut still to my dismay, my talented and smart OB-GYN would not let me take hormonal birth control because of the hypertension-causing risks associated with such medications. I valued her commitment to preventative public healthcare, but couldn\'t help but breakdown with tears that afternoon in her office when she gave me a firm ""No."" She questioned why I was crying, and I remember feeling so terrible about myself that day. I had come back from my summer internship with this grandiose plan to complete my summer transformation by finally getting rid of my acne. I had fixated on this moment the entire summer, because acne can destroy a person\'s self-esteem, especially when you are a 25 year-old woman using Tinder and hoping to meet the love of your life some point soon. In short, I had hit a dead end. The only alternative was to take Accutane, and I just didn\'t want to do that. It causes balding! My friend swears that she now has IBS because of Accutane. It fucks with your blood. I may be vain, but not to the point where I would risk the side effects of Accutane. So I made a new plan.\n\nMy plan is now commencing. I moved out of state to get a job post grad school, and did not give my new doctor my medical history. It\'s dumb. It\'s stupid. I will most definitely regret this at age 60 when I start to struggle with having a prematurely weathered heart. But, I don\'t want to spend the rest of my child-free days obsessing over my cystic acne. And to me, it is worth the risk to be able to live life to the fullest during my last bit of youth. So I went to the doctor, and thankfully have managed to keep the weight off. I still have good blood pressure readings, so they weren\'t concerned about hypertension. When they asked if I had a medical history of hypertension, I denied having one. I told them that I stayed on the copper IUD for so long because of my commitment to the environment, but that I desperately want to get rid of my acne now. My new doctor obliged, which brings me to today.\n\n\nWhat\'s Next:\n\nMy doctor took out my IUD and prescribed Apri 0.15 mg-0.03 mg tablet as my new form of birth control. I intend to give monthly updates via this thread on how the medication is affecting my cystic acne. I am on day four of taking Apri and I woke up this morning with a lot of nausea. The night prior, I was too nauseated to finish my dinner (only had a few bites). I thought I might be coming down with something, but I\'m almost positive it is due to the new BC prescription after reading reviews online. As I recall, you should take a BC for three months at least before giving up on it, so I intend to push through the nausea. \n\nQuantitative Tracking for Evaluation:\n\nBefore beginning Apri this week, I suffered a large acne break out. I am on the healing side of the breakout now, but for reference, I count about 19 blemishes on my face. They are pretty much in every major area of my face (cheeks, forehead, chin, jaw lines, temples/hair line, neck, and I also have a few acne cysts on my breasts and back). Here\'s to hoping! I shall update you in a few weeks.'"

I have felt this for a very long time, but this did not interfere with my life at all so I never had it checked. Plus, it did not happen a lot.\n\nIn January, I took my 3rd dose of covid vaccine, first being Pfizer, Oxford, and then Moderna. I came back and was in bed for 2 days straight because of the fever. While laying down with no air conditioner nor fan in a blanket, I noticed a weird itchy/burning/needle poking sensation in my chest, and my back. I thought I was hot or something *(I actually thought it was a side effect of the vaccine since a friend of mine mentioned that someone took the third dose and started itching like a crazy person)* but I shrugged it off.\n\nLater that week, I went out at 12PM and as soon as I was exposed to the sun, I felt like **hundreds of needles are poking** on my back and chest and also a bit of my scalp/head. I never scratched my chest or back. I always just kind of hugged myself so that it will feel better (nope). After 2-3 minutes of that feeling, small red dots start to appear on my forearm. My chest and back get red patches. This is has been going on for over about a month, and I finally decided to get it checked, but before I explain what the doctor said, let me mention what triggers this feeling:\n\n1. **The sun:** As soon as I'm exposed to the sun, I'm feeling like hundreds of needles are poking on my chest and my back. A few mins later, a bunch of red dots will appear on my forearm and red patches on my chest and my back. Doesn't matter if you are going out to just throw the garbage, or to move your car, you are going to feel it. It even happens when I'm exposed to indirect sunlight\n2. **Vacuum Cleaner:** Same\n3. **Exercising:** Same\n4. **Heat without the sun:** I would be sitting in a car/room with closed windows and no AC, and I'd start feeling that same feeling\n5. Even going out at night walking is triggering this\n\nNow that I've explained the triggers let's see what the doctor said.\n\nI went to a dermatologist and she said that I'm allergic to the sun. I did mention to her everything that I wrote here and that this happend right after taking the 3rd dose of my vaccine, and she told me that it is possible that might have triggered it since the vaccine increases white blood cells and whatnot. I also mentioned the triggers and she told me to take the medicine and apply the ointment which she gave for a week and then come back for a checkup. What she prescribed to me are the following:\n\n1. A sunscreen (Until I die )\n2. An ointment\n3. Tablets\n\nUpdate (1): I took the medicine that she gave me and applied sunscreen when going out in the sun. None of that helped. Sunscreen doesn't make that much of a difference. I went to the dermatologist again and she prescribed me some other meds. I will go for a check-up later this week. Has anyone been through this? I'm sort of fine with the itchy/poking feeling when exposed to the sun, but I'm getting that feeling even when I'm not exposed to the sun. Can hot water cause this? I shower with extremely hot water (steamy)?"""

(This will be long, sorry)\n\nI have been practicing for 5 years (4 if you dont count residency).  Once residency was complete, I dove straight into private practiceCOVID happened and practices shut down.  After that, I bopped around trying to find something full time, but had difficulty doing so.  I was finally at a place for over a yearpatients and I got along & I loved it. \nMy boss, on the other hand, he was the worsthe used me, manipulated me, talked down to me, etc. but we always seemed to get along and chat normally. I would always try to talk through bigger cases etc.\nI thought I was doing great, but eventually I had to leave (had to move due to family emergency).  I gave 3 months notice & it seem like everyone understood and was supportive.  I felt that I left on good terms. \nFast forward to about 6 months later- I reached out to my old boss for a reference and he said that he was doing a lot of retreatments on my patients and that it was eye opening for him to check on associates but that he was happy to write the reference.   I asked him if he could tell me more because I am still a fresh dentist and wanted to better myself & could use the feedbackhe never responded.  \nFast forward again, I find out that I got an extremely poor reference.\n\nSo basically he told me that I was a shit dentist with no explanation as to how or why & then told my future employer something similar to deter/warn them from hiring me.\n\nSince my initial interaction with him, I havent been able to stop thinking about it.  I absolutely hate myself and do not feel like Im equipped or capable to provide proper treatment.  I dont enjoy going to work anymore, I feel anxious and stressed everyday.  I cry at work (hidden in my office), on my way to work, when I think about how well others are doing and I am not.  I get hyperfixated while working, questioning if something is perfect or if Im doing a bad job. \nI would like to add that, like most others, been working at this being my career since I was in middle school.  I was top of my class in dental school, I was awarded top clinical provider prior to graduation.  In residency I was the first one in and last one out and my directors and attendings noted that I was motivated and my work was good.  Ive always done CEs too.\nSo what happened?  Was I never good all along?  Have I always sucked and I just was able to get by?   \n\nI recently was surrounded by old classmates and friends and everyone seems to be doing great.  They seem to have it under control.  They feel seasoned outside of school.  Maybe because my path was a little different, I fell behind?  \n\nCurrently, I feel stuck.  Paralyzed even.  I have a constant pit in my stomach and hate that I, someone who has driven herself crazy over dentistry, is now in this position.  So much self doubt.  Ive talked to my non dentist spouse about this and theyve been supportive & think its my old boss with a vendetta.  But I dont think thats true.  I dont think anyone can be malicious enough to tear down a new dentist trying to find their way.  What can I do?  What should I do?  \n\n\nTLDR: got a bad reference from an old boss & am now questioning if I should be a dentist. (5 years out of school)'"

If so how bad?\n\nSorry, I'm new here and I honestly don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I'm looking for medical advice, plus I need to vent a bit. I'm posting this in a few different subs with a few different alts since these keep getting deleted. I'm not trying to spam, I just need help and I don't know where to go.\n\nLast night I took 13 Norco (5-325). A few I tried to grind up and drink with a soda, but it tasted horrible, so the rest I swallowed. I had these left over from wisdom teeth surgery a year ago. Been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a few months now, but I've never really thought I was at risk or anything, seeing as I don't have any reliable means of attempting, nor have I made any real plans in the past. Yesterday I was in a dark place, and I just wanted it to end. I thought about the pills, and I knew it was dangerous but I didn't really think it would kill me, but I thought it might get me high or something. I wrote out a quick note in case it went south, but I assumed 65mg of hydrocodone wasn't enough to cause an overdose. I decided to wait until after work and then I took the pills. I wasn't sure what to expect, part of me knew I was hurting myself, but at the time it didn't feel like anything. I put on some music and walked around my city for a while. I didn't really feel high so much as tipsy, but it felt good for a little bit. I've never been drunk or high before, so I don't even have anything to compare it to, but for an hour or so, it was kinda fun, just walking around late at night. After a while I started to get tired, but as soon as I went to sit down, I felt a wave of exhaustion pass over me, so I decided to force myself to keep walking to stay awake. At about 2 am, I felt horrible again, and decided to drive home. I knew it wasn't safe, but it was only a 5 minute drive. I got home and went to bed. As I lay down my breath felt weak and I thought maybe I'd stop breathing in my sleep. I felt pretty nervous though so I took a few melatonin and decided I would be fine if I never woke up. I'm alive this morning, but I don't think I slept anyways, so I guess the hydrocodone wasn't too much. However, I've been thinking about the acetaminophen content of the pills. I took a little over 4000mg, which according to a quick search is over 4 times the max dose for an adult male (I'm 18M). I haven't vomited yet, but I'm still in bed and I feel a little nauseous and itchy. I just want to know if this will blow over or if I need to go get medical attention. I've already decided that I'm going to talk to my parents about the suicide ideations, but I really don't want to go to the hospital. I don't know how I would ever talk to my mom ever again if she knew I tried to kill myself, and I can be damn well sure my dad won't let me go to college in the fall, let alone help pay for it like he said he would. Please someone, I need some help and I don't know what to do from here. I don't have any reason to feel like this. Lots of other people in this sub have been through some horrible shit, and I'm just sitting here drowning in self-pity, even though I have a pretty good life. I hate myself, but I don't know if I'm depressed or just an idiot. These feelings are still pretty new to me, and I don't know who or what I am anymore. I know people will say I need meds or a therapist or something, but I don't even know where to look for those things. I'm not sure if I want to die anymore, but I know I don't want to destroy my body from this one mistake. I'm sorry for venting this much but somebody please respond so I know I'm not alone."""

I have been on lithium 300mg as well as trileptal 300mg, hydroxyzine 10mg for anxiety as needed. That is the same medications I have been on since about 20 years old, of course with some dosage changes here. So to say the least, I am pretty anxious about going through the psychiatrist treatment again. \n\nI am wondering, has anyone had any experience with buspirone? I am very very nervous to take it because I want to still feel like me, and I really don't want any side effects. Also, my anxiety has just been so bad that I feel that is why my medications are not working. My anxiety has been taking over my life more so lately than bipolar has. I feel I have the bipolar under control more than anything. \n\nI am one of those people that hates to have to take a medication for anxiety everyday, because I always felt it was something that can be controlled more so with lifestyle changes, but I am at the point now that I can't even function so I have to do this. \n\nI am also changing my lithium from immediate release to extended release. The reason for that is because on regular lithium, at least as of lately after a few years of taking, I just feel so unmotivated, faded, tired, etc. so the doc. suggested I do the extended release. Anyone have experience with Lithium ER? \n\nI would love to hear any and all experiences with these medications or even if its something similar that may help. I know each and every one of us is different when it comes to how our symptoms of bipolar are and how we react to medications but still would love to know your experiences. \n\nThank you so much everyone!"""

To fix this I was prescribed hydrocortisone cream (a steroid cream) to use for a week. I did so and the problem was sorted and my eczema completely disappeared for the most part.\n\nHowever, around a year ago (August 2021) I noticed it coming back, with my eyes being by far the worst. I knew hydrocortisone had worked before so I bought myself some. It worked after using it for a week however eczema kept coming back. Against my better judgment and rather stupidly, I ended up using hydrocortisone cream on the area around my eyes on and off for around 8-9 months - basically enough time to become addicted and reliant on the cream.\n\nIt was near the end of April 2022 that I decided to stop using the cream completely. For around 2 months I weened myself off the cream, dealing with some pretty rough side effects of corticosteroid withdrawal (dry eyes, rough skin, swelling). I have been 100% steroid free since July (around 3 months) and I am mostly happy with my eyes. My eczema has gone and all the painful/really bad side effects are gone.\n\nHowever, now I am dealing with redness around my eyelids, sometimes mild swelling (which goes away after applying a cold cloth or dunking my face in cold water, etc.) and the skin is rather sensitive and sometimes dry. I acknowledge I have damaged the skin around my eyes and will have to deal with that for a while however some days it is almost unnoticeable so I know I can eventually recover fully.\n\nI currently use a range of soothing eye ointments (hydrosil dry eye gel is one that has been particularly helpful) that I carry with me however these only do so much. I also notice that a piroten or Benadryl can help with the appearance of the skin (don't know if that information helps but trying to paint a full picture).\n\nThis is not an urgent issue and is definitely livable as I am no longer reliant on the steroid cream and most days it is not that noticeable (I also wear glasses most of the time which helps appearance-wise) but it is something I would ideally like to move past. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks :)"""

I have been struggling with performance anxiety and clinical depression since my first year in dental school. I failed in the 1st year which led to me getting 6 months drop from the original class I joined and later on I had to take another drop because of my fathers health conditions during covid time. And finally I was put in a regular batch where I made friends and was coping okayish. But unfortunately i failed 2 subjects in my final year and was given another drop of 6 months. \nI failed oral pathology and periodontics. My 3rd year oral pathology HOD has been consistently downright mean to me and even passed negative comments regarding my fathers health issues and my mental health issues. She thinks Im acting an elaborate play or faking things to gain sympathy. She didnt sign my journal coz I took a drop from 3rd year finals during my fathers hospitalisation days and later on when I was promoted to 4th year she agreed to sign my journal certificate. Unfortunately whenever I went to her, she kept sending me back or asking me to do corrections required and I did what I was asked to do. I must have gone to her more than a dozen times back and forth. She would call me during times when I was in lecture or in OPD or whenever I went, she wasnt in her cabin. When I had to go meet her post taking drops to sort things out in 3rd year, She passed insensitive remarks regarding my fathers health condition saying how can a person be sick for such a long time. My father was suffering from acute necrotising pancreatitis which led to 20% necrosis of his pancreas and all the complications related to it along with 12mm kidney stone which caused him immense pain and he was in ICU for a long time as he also has diabetes and high blood pressure. I brought all the relevant documents about my fathers health and asked her to make a note that I wasnt simple missing her classes because I am not punctual but because I need to be there for my family. She rejected seeing the reports by saying I dont want to see all this. I told her she can have a talk with my mother but she still did not accept that and she again said she doesnt want to have any talk with my family. She looked at me like I was selling her some sob story and sent me away. But her comments regarding my fathers health and the way she looked at me, led me to attempt suicide because she made me feel like its better for me to disappear than ever show my face to her. I tried hanging myself and my mom found me in the room doing that. My room has a key lock and she had the keys. After that I cried a lot and it took me a long time to recover. I gave my 3rd year finals and passed 2 out of 3 exams. I failed her exams and wasnt able to answer anything because looking at her in the exam hall triggered those memories of me trying to kill myself and everything she has done or said or how I cried pathetically during my fathers hospitalisation time. So I wasnt able to deal with all that and failed the exam. In 4th year I sat for the KT she gave me in her subject. The day before my practical exams, I had a major panic attack where I suffered from terrible chest pains and was not able to breath properly and kept shivering. I was taken to the hospital and given IV and medication to calm down. I was in the hospital till the evening and barely had time to study for her practicals. This time I passed the theory exam but I was failed in the practical exams. She threw my answer paper on my face when the external asked me questions and asked me how was my theory paper. I was answering her and she saw the bruises I got from the IV, injections and blood tests they did the night before. And the external asked me about the same and when I told her honestly, the HOD lady lost her shit and threw the paper on my face saying how dare I go around tell others she failed me when I am not worth of passing. She thought I was trying to gain sympathy from the external. She has been mentally harassing me this way since past 1 year and so much that I have PTSD and seeing her triggers me. I also had a massive panic attack during my Periodontics practical exam and fainted. I failed that exam. \nMy father went to have a talk with my dean of the college and asked him about how my exams will be taken. He met my college mentor who asked me to meet her. I met her today and she asked me to sit for the classes and then said how all my peers have becomes intern doctors and I am still in final year 1st term. \nI came home and cried a lot. I felt its not worth living because Ive been in a lot of mental pain since my first year of dental school. I have invested my whole teenage and everything to become a dentist and yet I keep getting slapped like this by my fate and made to struggle every single day. I am beyond heartbroken and depressed, if I get failed another time then I dont know what I will do. The oral pathology HOD is responsible for passing people in practicals and if she fails me again I dont know what to do. \nMy parents tell me they understand my pain but they dont. My father and I have regular fights about all this. I am so exhausted that even getting up from bed or closing my eyes feel draining. I have been constantly crying and dreaming about dying. \nI dont know how to cope or manage anything and I cant even put an official complaint against her as I am worried she may take it personally and fail me again. But the things she made me go through deserves her to be reported in the college. Worst part is she is a doctor herself and yet she bullied me like I am some insignificant vermin not worth being taken into any consideration.\nSomeone please help me. I am so lost and in so much pain. \nMy father said he will go and have talk with my HOD. But sadly during fights he shouts at me me and tells me about how going to my college and talking to the teachers and everyone there is him having to beg for me which hurts me a lot.'"

The thought was that those grandfathered in would eventually leave our practice.\n\nBut that has not actually happened. I have about two dozen patent on long-term opioids, all more than ten years. Some have even moved out of state, only to return unable to find a PCP willing to continue their long-term opioids. One lady has been driving three hours each way every three months for her BID hydrocodone 5/325mg!\n\nSo, as a practice, we have decided to stop prescribing long-term opioids (with the exception of 2-4 tramadol per day, and Suboxone).\n\nOur strategy is to send a letter to avoid meltdowns in the office, refer to pain management center of their choice, and/or wean over 6-12 months. Our pain centers generally don't do long-term opioids.\n\nI am wondering what other tips you might have?\n\n\n\nEDIT: Looks like I need to give some context. This has not come out of the blue.\n\n1) Pressure from the higher-ups in my multi-billion dollar corporation\n\n2) Increased regulatory requirements. My state has requirements beyond what the DEA has in terms of documentation, checking the controlled substances database, drug screening, etc. Add in further corporate policies. It has gotten quite onerous.\n\n3) Most of my colleagues are still new in their careers, and simply dont do long-term opioids. Thats what they were taught, thanks to those CDC guidelines. I have not taken a week off since before Covid, but will have to do so soon for my own mental health, and I will have to turn over my inbox from time to time. My colleagues are simply not comfortable refilling RXs even for Xanax 0.5mg qhs only.\n\n4) My staff gets understandably annoying when a patient calls 16 times a day (seriously), one week before her oxycodone RX is due, just to make sure I dont forget.\n\n5) Long-term opioids by PCPs is simply no longer the standard of care in my area. I am an outlier. It puts me an a ethically dubious position when a pain center decides that long-term opioids for a patient of mine is ill-advised, but then I overrule them and do so anyway.\n\nI appreciate all of the feedback, and I am not completely happy with the change in policy, but I see where it comes from.\n\nYet, I am the one with the medical license. I can think of one patient I will keep on his Paregoric, without which he is fecally incontinent due to prior surgery for Crohns."""

influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/e60v6p/on_deciding_wisdom_teeth_extraction_and_my/,b'On deciding wisdom teeth extraction and my experience with it',,"b'I\'ve done quite a bit of research into this, just want to echo my thoughts and clear up some questions I have.\n\nFrom what I\'ve found, prophylactic wisdom teeth removal, like circumcision, is a pretty American thing. There is some controversy around it, and as much as doctors may be ""on your side"", I find it hard to believe that with the procedure\'s price tag so high (up to a few hundred dollars per tooth) dentists are not inclined to be liberal prescribing such a simple and low risk operation.\n\nHere\'s how I understand the issue:\n\nWisdom teeth impaction usually does not cause any issues, and most problems can be reactively addressed without serious lasting effects. Something like 2/3 to 3/4 of people with unextracted impacted wisdom teeth have no problems with them throughout their life?\n\nThe argument here is that it\'s better to be safe and sorry, as well that you heal faster when you are young, which does make some sense (I had my sutures removed on day 10, and my dentist remarked that I healed surprisingly fast). But that\'s in the same vein as something like appendectomy (which is very prevalent in Japan), albeit with a much lower stake in risk and reward.\n\nNext, whether the impacted wisdom tooth is erupted or not also seems to play a large factor in determining risk. Food can get stuck under the gums of semi-erupted teeth, making it hard to clean and drastically increases the likelihood of caries. (Even fully erupted teeth can cause problems with surrounding gums?) It seems like in this situation it is reasonably advisable to have them removed.\n\nThus the toughest judgement balances around when the tooth is not harmfully impacted as well as being unerupted, still fully under the gums. Operating in this scenario usually requires more intrusive incisions, as well as drilling the tooth into fragments. The argument with unerupted wisdom teeth is that since they don\'t fully settle until your mid-20s, it\'s not easy to say whether they will cause problems until then, when you won\'t be covered by your parents\' insurance anymore. But this seems to me like a problem created by the market, and these operations are also the most expensive. Most people say they do it simply because their insurance covers it; make of that what you will.\n\nIf you opt for a ""wait and see"" attitude here, it would seem advisable to get annual x-rays to monitor the tooth\'s condition?\n\nThis is the situation I\'m currently in. I\'ve had my lower left removed and I\'m trying to decide if I should get the other done. I didn\'t do almost any research going in, and my dentist mentioned that I could do one at a time, so as to allow chewing on the other side.\n\nI was given local anesthetic, and while getting a large needle into your mouth is definitely a lot more painful than a vaccine to the arm, it was not a big deal. 30 minutes later, I mentioned my jaw towards the chin was completely numb, but I still had feeling further back outside where the wisdom tooth was. I was given a second dose, which still didn\'t completely numb my jaw but I decided what the hell, it was fine. The operation itself took almost an hour, longer than I had anticipated. Afterwards, I recovered in the lobby for another 30 minutes as I was given a prescription and gauze.\n\nOverall, I wouldn\'t say it was painless as I had read, but it wasn\'t exactly pain_ful_ either. My dentist did slip and poked my mouth a couple times while prying. Definitely *very* intense, especially with the drill; I\'ve never had any serious injuries in my life, this is definitely one of the most intense experiences I\'ve ever had. I don\'t think I\'ll ever forget the sound and sensation of my tooth shattering in my jaw. The sutures aren\'t fun either, although that\'s mostly due to my imagination of what\'s happening.\n\nI made the mistake of getting the drugs about an hour too late though, and by the time the tylenol kicked in I was in misery. Should have either started right after the operation or asked for another dose of anesthetic before leaving. (not sure if they would have given it to me, due to concerns or price?) The constant salivating was also very annoying and slightly painful, having to swallow every minute or more. I wonder if having a diuretic like coffee might have helped? (I asked the pharmacist, he said he wasn\'t sure if that was advisable lol)\n\nAte a big lunch before operation, had chicken soup and noodles on the first night. I managed to get the bleeding to stop by the time I went to bed, about 9 hours after the operation. Even with tylenol, the pain made it hard to go to sleep. Day 2 was relatively painless, but on the morning of day 3 I woke with a worsening burning sensation in my entire cheek. Was worried I had gotten dry socket despite being so careful, but a few tylenols later seemed fine again. Ate very little the first few days, ice cream and noodles; didn\'t brush teeth until 3rd night (call me overcautious). This caused some bleeding, and I noticed how the gums of my 2 anterior molars had blood clots as well. I was surprised how much they were peeled out from the teeth. I\'ve had to use a syringe and toothpicks to clean out the food stuck in the gaps as well as the new pocket where the tooth was for about 4 weeks now, although it is slowly closing back up.\n\nRest of my recovery was uneventful, besides the day 10 suture removal by which point I was almost nearly fully healed. I suppose my experience is on the better end of the spectrum, but I\'m still not sure if all this discomfort and inconvenience is worth getting my other tooth done.\n\n[Here is my x-ray](https://imgur.com/UAQruBA) and [photo of unextracted wisdom tooth on my right](https://imgur.com/jqQJIfX).'"

I cannot for the life of me figure it out. Ill make it as short as I can. \n   \n   Im a 35 y/o male and I have Crohns Disease. I have it bad. Ive had 3 bowel surgeries, Ill have an ileostomy the rest of my life. Ive had a fischer, Ive had a large pocket of infection sliced open while I was awake, Ive dealt with a year long battle with a stricture...this is where your bowels get blocked...Ive had and healed 6 sub cutaneous fistulas (open holes on your belly that tunnel from your intestines and make an open hole on your belly) One surgery I was 61 and weighed 93 lbs (due to medical mismanagement) on and on and on. \n    \n   I do not posses the vocabulary for the amount pain and sorrow Ive been through. Ive been on very high doses of Prednisone not for days or months...but years. Twice...Ive been put on the strongest pain medicines know to man for years...and then gotten off of them. \n     \n   The last two years I dealt with another stricture which yielded over 20 extremely traumatic messy ER visits. A full grown man screaming for mercy in pain. Nurses/Doctors running down hallways to push med in to get me out of pain. I ended up having a surgery a year ago to remove the stricture...it went well. \n    \n   It was time to get off the pain meds three weeks later and day three, I crashed. The vomiting was so bad it split my incision. My PCP basically told me to go pound sand...he wouldnt talk to me personally and trotted out some nurse to basically tell me day 3 was the worst and to suck it up. I went to the ER...they billed me as a drug seeker as well. They gave me no attention for 6 hours. I begged them for a CT scan. The radiologist saw the split. The doctor rushed into my room after 6 hours in agony...didnt apologize and pushed a pain med finally. I forcefully demanded she contact my surgeon in a nearby big city. He found out what was going on and immediately had me taken by medcu to his hospital where they squared me away. He was pissed. \n   \n   Fast forward a year later to present day. I have faithfully tapered off of Ketamine, Dilaudid and Fent patches...and Im down to 12mg of Oxycodone per day. \n   \n   In my state 4 years ago I was named Crohns and Colitis Man of The Year for my fundraising efforts and for counseling other folks in the same boat. In my whole city Im the guy people come to for Crohns and Colitis help. That means the world to me. \n   \n  Im getting near the end of my taper like I said...and my anxiety is through the roof. Ive been using medical pot for help and its been a big help. Unfortunately, I overdid it and used edibles and got Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. Three absolutely terrifying ER trips two weeks ago. I have ceased all pot use for the time being naturally.\n   \n   I have a certified PTSD counselor Ive met with once per week for the last two years, I juice, I have a thriving yoga practice, I drink 3 bottles of Essentia every day, I meditate through headspace every day, I use my Apple Watch for bio feedback, I quit coffee and alcohol, I take at least two baths per day and I walk at least three miles per day and I eat primarily nutrient dense food. I have arguably the greatest wife of all time and a beast of a Father who has been there for it all and never wavered. \n   \n   I am processing all of this as I come off the drugs. I cry multiple times per day. Not even ashamed. Its how I get all this shit out and heal. \n   \n   The local ER and my new PCP will RX me everything under the sun but a rescue med.(A real one) I told my doctor about how some nights Im pacing my house for literally hours. Ive got Clonidine, Baclofen and Bispurone(Too afraid to take)\n   \n   I am getting my head kicked in every single day by major panic attacks. And I totally understand there is a major crackdown in my state on Benzos. Despite all of this...I am still crawling forward. Im winning. Full on survival mode. It sounds arrogant and I am not an arrogant guy...but I am a fucking savage. I have been dealt some very unfortunate cards...this thing has almost killed me twice...its terrifying...it is absolutely terrifying. It might take me a minute sometimes...or a couple of days...but eventually...I stand up...I spit it in its fucking face and keep crawling forward. Its not pretty...its not heroic its fucking war. And Ive gotten to know a side of itself most people will not. And thats pretty damn cool. Steal sharpens steal. Im also, letting Christ back into my life...slowly(Really hard but worth it) I am so proud of myself.\n\nBut somebody please...help me understand...why a guy like me cant get 5 Ativan for a month for a rescue med. Give me one single pill, so I can stare at it...and at least know I could end my suffering if I wanted. Theres power in that, at least for me. A few pills for when I lock up in a panic attack that lasts for more then an hour I do not think is an unreasonable request. \n\nBut they make me feel like Im dirty or something or like Im a drug seeker.

I have been dealing with Rosacea (diagnosing myself with type II). I have fortunately never dealt with acne until I was diagnosed with Rosacea October 2022. Prior to my visit with the derm, I was experiencing very subtle flushing/redness around the nose (honestly looked like a gentle allergic reaction). I was prescribed an oral antibiotic (doxycycline 100mg) and a prescribed cream (ivermectin cream 1%) and at the time had **ZERO** acne. After I started using both, I immediately started to flair up pretty bad and I\'ve been trying to tame/deal with the acne ever since. I continued the treatment and had several visits with the derm, below were the changes/medicines used.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 1st Visit = Ivermectin Cream (1%), Doxycycline Hyc 100mg \\[\\~6 weeks\\]\n* 2nd Visit = Ivermectin Cream (1%), Doxycycl Hyc 100mg \\[\\~4 weeks\\] \n* 3rd Visit = Tacrolimus Ointment 0.1%, Minocycline 100mg \\[\\~2ish weeks\\] \n\nNone of the above helped so I consulted an acne/rosacea specialist in Charlette at a place called Skin Pharm. She had me stop all medication and completely simplify my face wash routine (i.e., gentle cleanser and moisturizer only). After subsiding and calming down a bit, she recommended getting a BBL and seeing if there were any positive results. She also recommended slow introducing Azelaic Acid (10%). Unfortunately, the BBL treatment did not yield positive results so I stopped after the first treatment. The AA 10% was not doing much for me, but my face was definitely not getting worse. Fast forward a few weeks, I recently drove down to Tennessee to a different Skin Pharm location to get another opinion. I was prescribed a new in-house gel (Metronidazole 1%, Ivermectin 1%, Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate 5%, and Nacinamide 4%) and was told to start back on the Minocycline 100mg (1x per day) for 3 months max. I am \\~6 weeks into this new plan and have seen very little results (I\'ve gone through 1-2 waves of bad ""purging"" / new breakouts"". Attaching pictures of my current face and listing out my current routine and all products being used currently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Morning = Skin Pharm Gentle Soothing Cleanser, Skin Pharm in-house gel (above), Cocokind Texture Smoothing Cream Moisturizer, Clearstem YouAreSunshine SPF, 1x 100mg Minocycline (w/ food)\n* Evening =  Skin Pharm Gentle Soothing Cleanser, Cocokind Texture Smoothing Cream Moisturizer\n\nMy plan is to continue the prescribed / in-house gel and oral antibiotic for 12 weeks and if I see no changes, get off both and reevaluate. I have tried to simplify my routine as much as possible as I was previously using a Skin Pharm moisturizer (face whip) that contained hyaluronic acid (which I was told to avoid). On a personal note, I exercise a lot (mostly running) but try to get my exercise done very early in the morning to avoid the heat and shower immediately after. I\'m very conscious of the sun and wear SPF, a hat, and sunglasses.\n\nI am completely open to any and all opinions, recommendations, and thoughts! I know this is very common and people have it much worse, but it\'s been very challenging living with this as I spent the first 30 years of my life with little to no acne. I\'d love to be able to tame and get rid of the acne then start to develop a routine to manage the redness. \n\nThank you so much!'"

September 2021 I had a hysterectomy. I had been on testosterone for 8 years and had tolerated transition very well with no side effects. I have not had a period since 2 months into testosterone.

Jan 2022 was extremely fatigued I couldnt stop sleeping felt very off. feb 2022 developed congestion , dry watery eyes , night sweats and then one night I woke out of sleep gasping for air and was extremely out of breath I was sweating like crazy I felt almost delusional I felt so ill. The next few nights I had similar but less intense experience. During this time it was found that my bathroom had been leaking and mold was found and cleaned up ( mostly) I had taken about 3 days off work. I then returned to work and started to have a lot of chest pain, racing heart. I couldnt walk far with out becoming out of breath and having severe chest pain. I ended up having such severe pain I went to hospital and they told me I had chest wall inflammation and to take Advil and  rushed me out. I took about 5 days off work I felt okay when resting however laying flat I could not breath and I had a lot of pain at night so I propped my self up and felt better. I started to feel alot better and I returned to work. I kept having shortness of breath, chest pain, hot flashes, alot more anxiety then normal. It really seemed like out of nowhere my heart would just pound. At night I kept gasping for air it got to the point I was scared to sleep. My family doctor was away for all of this and I had seen her replacement who suggested I had costochronditus. So I went to my physio and he was a-bit stumped on that as he didnt think that would effect breathing so much as it wasnt just painful to breathe it actually was hard to breathe. My family doctor returned and said she thinks its my hormones and long story short shes been blaming it on estrogen withdrawal  do to hysterectomy. However my endocrinologist who is well known for working with trans patients said its EXTREMELY-unlikely especially as I had been on testosterone for so long with out a period .

nortriptyline,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzodiazepines/comments/8rewfw/kind_of_confused_about_something/,b'Kind of confused about something.',,"b""So I recently had my psychiatrist appointment, and told them I was still getting a bit antsy and dealing with panic attacks on my current 2x.5mg daily Clonazepam dose. The thing is, I'm also about 4 weeks into a 50mg a day Nortriptyline dose. To be honest, I've felt practically the same taking the nortriptyline, but not content with my current Clonazepam dosage from before starting it. The way I put it to them was like this. I slowly tappered my Clonazepam dose into week 3 of the nortriptalyne treatment to try and get to baseline, so I could see if the nortriptyline was having a general effect on depression but for this reason specifically, anxiety/panic attacks. I said it wasn't cutting it and I had to go back onto the Clonazepam after a week to stay semi well on a day to day basis (which is all true) though it was barely helping as mentioned above. Now when I said this, they upped me to a 2x1mg daily Clonazepam dose and to keep on with the nortriptyline as we still need to measure thyroid levels etc.\n\nBut here's the thing I don't get. They seems like docs that dont want to use the Clonazepam long term, but how would they ever get a proper reading on if any drug other than the Clonazepam was working, if I had never stopped the Clonazepam daily dosage? And even with the tappering on my own accord (which I'm sure most patients wouldnt do), how could we tell that it wasnt withdrawal/rebound anxiety that was causing the anxiety/panic attacks and see if the nortriptyline was helping at all?\n\nWith the looks of it, I think they're ok with keeping the Clonazepam long term now if it's the only thing that works (and I know that's the case for sure after all the AD I've tried), but I just find it odd for them to see if any drug is having a good effect on anxiety while still on a regular benzo treatment, or not withdrawal/rebound issues from cutting the benzos down in a period of time.\n\nMaybe I'm talking out my ass, but I'm curious to see what you guys think."""

I tried to keep it as short as possible but its all been a little over a year since it all started.\n\nAbout a year ago my (24F) hairline started receding. I figured it was either the new shampoo I was using or the fact that Id felt a few pimples along my hairline and constantly kept digging around for more (sorry, I love popping pimples lol) so when I noticed my hair thinning I stopped the shampoo and tried my best to stop picking and some little hairs started coming back.\n\nLater I developed red rashes along my hairline, just enough under the hair that you couldnt see them from my face, and the back of my neck towards the bottom of my scalp. They were itchy but really only when Id hadnt washed my hair in a day or two.\n\nNow the rashes come and go but my scalp has started to feel grainy. I have mild dandruff but these grains arent skin flakes theyre harder and I can pick them out and look at them. Ive had them for a while and havent seen any lice so its safe to rule eggs out, imo.\n\nI saw a dermatologist and he didnt see anything concerning (I wasnt having a rash flare up and didnt have these grains yet) but he did a hair pull test and nothing abnormal. We did blood work and everything came back fine. He attributed it to stress.\n\nIm not sure if this is related but around the same time my hair started to recede my eyelashes started growing straight down. I always had very long lashes with a beautiful natural curl, people would ask me if they were fake all the time. Now theyve dulled a bit in color and its almost impossible to get them back to what they were even with a lash curler and a lash lift (essentially a perm for your lashes). I can barely even see through them. It might sound silly but this is a huge insecurity of mine.\n\nI have two older sisters, 26 and 28, and neither have these issues. No past family hair loss issues. I only take anticonvulsant medications because I have epilepsy but my neurologist said hair loss shouldnt be a side effect of any.

covid,https://www.reddit.com/r/ambien/comments/10o0jc3/ambien_fixed_my_brain_damage_literally/,b'Ambien Fixed My Brain Damage (Literally)',,"b""TL:DR - I had a series of brain injuries due to COVID. I took an Ambien one morning because I hadn't gotten any sleep the previous night and was trying to get whatever sleep I could, and I found out that it greatly aided my brain damage. Even so, every night when the Ambien wears off, I Flowers for Algernon myself back to sleep\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo, I just got simultaneously the best and somehow the stupidest medical news I've gotten in years. So first some context, I had a series of relatively minor brain injuries due to long-COVID neurological complications in October and November. \n\nI should mention also, relatively minor meaning relative to other brain injuries, meaning I'm not for instance in a persistent vegitative state or some other more horrifically profound brain injury, but it has lead to a situation where I've been almost exclusively housebound, and within that, largely bedbound since. \n\nAnd it means things like, having tremendous difficulty with moving and especially proprioception (body's ability to find itself in space), my ability to convey and understand language has been reasonably extensively affected, my emotional regulation has been non-existent, and so it's still been a nightmare.\n\nSo one morning where I'd gotten zero sleep and was decompensating neurologically, I took an ambien in hopes of getting to sleep, even if it was 11AM. \n\nSo I try to sleep, to no avail, for another hour with my eyes closed. And after that had happened, I was reaching a point where I was genuinely about to cry, because I had had to pee because I'd been laying there for so long, and moving is a nightmare when I'm decompensated. So when I sat up, and I didn't feel like a brick that'd been thrown into an old dryer, I was like. wait. hold on. I feel... normal. like, the most normal I've ever felt since before the. the BRAIN INJURY. UHHH.\n\nSo now, I take 10mg of Ambien once every day between 11AM and 1PM. And it works! Because apparently, and not just for me, Ambien helps people with brain damage to recover in many cases a great deal of otherwise damaged neurological function, at least for while the drug is active. And although it's been known about for some decades now, it's still incredibly poorly understood as to why or how it has this effect.\n\nAnd I will say, and I think you're all going to probably laugh at what comes next, before I had my brain injury, I felt I had a certain prowess when it came to various intellectual and cognitive tasks, and people would even sometimes comment on it. \n\nAnd from what people conveyed to me back then, I was thought of by a lot of the people in my life as being an intelligent person who had a certain way with words. I was even in an Electrical Engineering program with a straight-across 4.0 literally right up until the brain injuries happened this past October.\n\nAnd so while Ambien gives me a great deal of my old self back during the daytime, to the extent that I can write a post like this in this level of detail (I'm on the tail end of today's dose, for instance), when it wears off in the evening time (in about 20 minutes for me right now), I Flowers for Algernon myself to sleep every night. So I'll be answering questions once this gets posted. Ambien me wrote this post, and brain damage me will be answering your questions and responding to your comments.\n\nHaving seen the top few posts on this board, I thought y'all would get some laughs out of me answering questions with brain damage mode activated"""

For starters, Ive had seborrheic dermatitis since I was around 14 (have a whole bag of medication and nothing works, lately Ive learned if I sleep on wet hair my scalp basically turns to mush and scabs and bleeds like crazy. I've tried to wash it less and sleep with it dry and its helping more than any meds have.) \n2. Since I was 13/14 every 3 months probably I get this crazy rash of tiny tiny bumps around my lips. Its so painful and I have a cream (triamcinolone .1%) that will clear it up in about 3-4 days. Without it, it lasts around 2 weeks. If I can figure out how Ill insert some pics. Its not herpes, derm has said its a reaction from the sun mixed with Advil but I know thats not the case bc it has happened many times when I have not taken Advil or been in the sun. \n3. I have had shingles FIVE times. The first time was when I was 17 and the last time I got them was about 2 years ago. Theyve been on my legs and back. Never had chickenpox but dr says its from the chickenpox vaccine I had as a baby. Almost every time I get shingles I get thrush in my mouth and its horribly painful oh and in October I got my first yeast infection. \n4. This doesnt really apply but when I was 17 I got Zika after visiting Cuba and on my bday, I had thrush, shingles, and Zika all at once. \n5. Last year around this time I got pityriasis rosea. Mother patch started on my left ribcage and then tiny dots spread all over. \n6. I have pretty bad eczema, mainly on my arms (crease of elbow) and I use the same cream that I use on my lips and that helps. \n7. I am constantly getting random rashes that have no explanations. \n8. I have very very sensitive skin, new products constantly irritate it. \n\nSorry for such a long list but I had to include it all. I am pretty healthy, do yoga and am active. My only allergies are penicillin and I had a patch test appointment set up for this week but due to covid-19 it is not considered an essential so it was canceled. I feel like my skin is falling apart and it drives me crazy. Not celiac and have met with an immunologist who tested me for lots of autoimmune diseases and I dont have any.

Low and behold, when the adult tooth comes in, its noticeably discoloured and misshapen - Im talking a 30 or so degree angle, chocolate brown streaking, and generalized yellow discolouration at the tip of the tooth.\n\nAside from that, everything is pretty straight, good size, and never needed braces. But this front tooth had been a major point of insecurity, people made fun of it, and I avoided smiling with teeth or opening my mouth too much at all cost. \n\nAt 13/14 years old I was getting root canal for a back molar (didnt have dental coverage so it got REALLY bad before we could get it fixed). The dentist pointed it out and asked if I wanted it shaved down so the edge was straight and most the discolouration gone. Obviously, the other (normal) central incisor would be brought down to match. I was ecstatic and agreed without much thought or consulting my parents. Relief of having the most noticeable discolouration passed  pretty quickly. \n\nI wasnt really buck toothed before,  but the width was complimentary to the length (of the non-malformed tooth) and for over 10 years now Ive just felt stubby. Dont get me wrong its better than before, but still a big point of insecurity.\n\nBasically all I hear people talk about/find information on are expensive veneers. But I have concerns with strength (being the central incisors) and cutting caffeine (Im a nurse in a pandemic, sorry the coffee has to stay). \n\nSo if anyone has recommendations on what other solutions I can look into it would be very appreciated!

The redness does not turn white when pressed on. \n\nI went to the ER last night due to concern of the rash spreading and was prescribed 60mg of prednisone to take over a 5 day period as well as benedryl to take every 6 hours. ER doctor told me it was an unknown eruption and likely due to an allergic reaction, however I have no known allergies. My only concern is that since taking the first dose of prednisone, the rash has spread to my stomach and chest. The original rash on my legs has seemed to settle quite a bit, however I am concerned about the rash on my stomach. I am also experiencing moderate stomach pain/cramping however I am unsure if that is due to the prednisone or a symptom of the rash. Would love some clarity on when/if I should seek care or if anyone may know what caused the rash. (Pics attached in comments)'"

Been to 4 dermatologists, no one can help'",Image979.jpg,"b""Hi\n\nI've had a staph infection on the lip over the past months. It was treated with mupriocin (bactroban) in my nose & on the lips with mupriocin and an ointment with fusidic acid. My lips got better but right now it's like in the picture and they REALLY burn. The culture swab did not show anything special (no staph anymore). Blood test & swab also showed I don't have the herpes virus.\n\nI don't use anything with SLS or fluoride, I have not used any makeup or perfume for the past month, I always drink with a straw and I've been eating with a little desert fork for the past few months so food won't get on my lips. My derm prescribed me antibiotics to take orally (Bactrim) but it did not help as well. I only use Dexeryl cream and an Uriage balm (both prescribed by my dermatologist).\n\nAnd I have switched 4 dermatologists, two of them were professors and still they all just suggest I use hydrocortisone but idk if that's a long term solution? Also no one will tell me what exactly this is. I just can't believe there is literally no doctor in the world who can recognize this disease. I have troubles with my lips since November 2021 and it might sound silly but it really ruined my social life and my mental health. So ANY tips would be so so so welcome\n\nUPD 21 June 2022: it got worse (yellow crust) so I went to see the allergist yesterday. Probably allergic eczema developed because of using too much/too often mupriocin, fucidic acid, different lip balms and hydrating substances. Getting a patch test in august, until then I shouldn't use ANYTHING near my lips, preferably nothing on my whole face for 2 months & hydrocortisone 2 x a day for 2 weeks, then 1 x a day 2 weeks then stop or use it once a week & they advised me to check my blood for vitamines. Also, according to the docs an allergy for vaseline is very very very rare so I am allowed to still use plain vaseline. Let's wait and see. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0gpmam8ptf691.png?width=996&format=png&auto=webp&s=610bc28f54b8b5abc8355468381882ee54de521f\n\nUPD 28 July 2022:\nSo after using cortisone 2x a day for 2 weeks, I switched to 1 x a day and it immediately got worse. I was super sad and hopeless but went back to 2 x a day for another week. After, tried 1 x a day for a week again and my lips seemed to stay normal. So I tried to reduce the usage of hydrocortisone and applied it every other day for a week. And then reduce it again. Today Im off hydrocortisone for exactly 1 week and my lips are okay. Sure, you still see where it all started (some parts of my upper lip are darker than normal) and when I eat, the outer line of my underlip gets super red, but thats it. Otherwise I have only used Vaseline since the last time Ive been to the doctor. No makeup on the face, no facewash etc. Still planning on seeing the derm for the patch test in august. Very curious to understand what has happened and why my lips went back to normal (thank God for that tho). I hope this positive result is not temporary.\n\nUPD 31 July: jinxed it, got red small bumps again. Used hydrocortisone, this will probably help. 10 days without it, personal record.\n\nUPD 12 September: +- one month eczema free. The patch test showed that Im slightly allergic to nickel, so I stopped wearing my rings (normally I wore them everyday). Anyway idk if the eczema went away because of that (I do wear my rings once in a couple of days now, and it doesnt come back) or because of some other reason. I was told its possible that if you reduce your level of stress it just stops. That could be the case for me. Or nickel. Idk. Just happy its over. \n\nThe only thing that doesnt go away is the red dark line on my underlip. That one didnt go away even when I was using hydrocortisone, so the derm suggested to use protopic for a couple of weeks for that particular spot. According to her there are no negative consequences of protopic but idk somehow I just dont trust it. Anyone any experience with protopic on the lips ? (Tacrolimus)\n\nUPD 19 September: I used b5 cicaplast lipbalm from La Roche Posay yesterday and woke up with blisters this morning. Idk of its related, but switch of the balm (I normally use Uriage) is the only change (except for stress and less sleep) in my routine from the past month. Very confusing because the allergy test showed Im not allergic to this balm (took it with me to patch test). So now back to hydrocortisone and I hope it will go away AND STAY AWAY.\n\nUPD 16 November: Im doing fine, problem seems to be solved by not wearing any rings and not using the la roche posay balm. My derm said is possible the patch test did not show allergy to this balm because the allergy is minor, while the skin on my lips was thinned by hydrocortisone and extra sensitive from all the medication I used so it seems legit to her that I get a reaction on my lips and not on my back where the skin is thicker. Anyway, if you are still reading here, it means you are struggling as well and are looking for any help. Those would be my tips for anyone going through the same thing:\n- have culture tests to exclude any bacterial infections \n- WASH YOUR HANDS\n- dont eat spicy food\n- dont drink with a metal straw in case you might be allergic for nickel \n- have an allergy test (might show nothing, might show something, but at least youd know)\n- stop using ANY products on your skin around the lips except for pure Vaseline\n- give it TIME! It took literally 1 year for my lips to heal. Between the worse outbreaks and complete healing +- 5 months. Your skin needs time, your life isnt ruined even if it might seem like it is sometimes."""

NSAID,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/105vnhi/intermittent_inconsistent_pain_following_molar/,"b'Intermittent, inconsistent pain following molar crown w/o root canal: what to do?'",,"b'So, Im hoping someone here can offer some suggestions as to what might be going on, and thoughts on how I might proceed. \n\nThe detailed section is long (to provide a complete picture). \n\nTLDR version: can prednisone resolve severe pain following a crown without a root canal, or is it likely to just be a bandaid, and the pain will return when the steroids are stopped?\n\nTo note, Im a lupus patient on long-term immunosuppressants (no regular steroids as part of my treatment, though) with a co-morbid fibromyalgia dx. Pre-appt antibiotics were taken before every appt. History of right-side trigeminal neuralgia (neurogenic, secondary to lupus), considered resolved in 2014. That, uncontrolled, would be a 9 on my personal pain scale, for reference. Wisdom teeth removed 20 years ago. \n\nTimeline:\n\n-Late October: Fillings were placed on #15 in late October, following acute onset unprompted pain and temperature sensitivity (cold and heat). Unprompted pain stopped and sensitivity was significantly reduced, but not resolved. \n\n\n-12/29: crown placed on #15 due to lingering sensitivity and desire to intervene before more extensive treatment would be needed (I pushed for this); no root canal performed. Immediately after the local anesthetic starts to wear off, I start to feel a severe pain, with a pressure or crushing sensation. The crown is not pressing on #14, and the gums dont show any signs of infection or flawed margins. The tooth is hypersensitive to cold and pressure; no reaction to heat or light touch. No signs of infection or abscess were noted. Pain level consistently at an 8-8.5. \n\n-1/3: no improvement in pain level when unmedicated. Pain mostly controlled when taking acetaminophen, Toradol, baclofen, and low dose opioids (all prescribed under a pre-planned protocol for the express purpose of controlling severe pain when it appears until the cause can be addressed, in hopes of avoiding triggering a neuro lupus complication that basically prompts a pain feedback loop; I can detail this further if necessary, but this event did not trigger this complication, and this is the first time Ive needed to use this protocol in 7 years). As soon as each dose starts to wear off, the pain returns full force. Toradol, as an extremely potent NSAID, has a strict 5 day limit (before the risk of organ damage and GI bleeds becomes too high), so the afternoon was the last time I was able to take this med. In the evening, I was told to take 5mg prednisone and hydroxyzine for a minor allergic reaction (completely unrelated to the dental issue).\n\n-1/4: upon waking up, even though the Toradol and other pain meds are out of my system, the pain is greatly reduced. Down to a 3-4 at most, and part of that is simply jaw pain after the past 5 days of hell. I see my dentist to check the tooth and make sure there are still no visible problems (none noted), and then my endodontist for a scheduled root canal on #21 (scheduled weeks ago). The endo also notes no obvious signs or issues, and double checks via X-ray. At this point, Ive taken 2.5mg of prednisone that morning, along with Tylenol and naproxen (taken daily for lupus arthritis). The pain has remained steady and lowered. \n\n-1/4 afternoon: 2 hours after leaving the endo, I drink some cold water and the pain in #15 immediately returns to an 8-8.5, and stays there for the rest of the day. \n\n1/5-present: Ive consistently taken 5mg prednisone, and while Ive had a brief period or 2 where the pain returned to a 6-7, it has largely stayed at or below a 3 (at most), without taking anything besides the Tylenol and naproxen I already take daily. \n\n*********************************************\nMy question: is the prednisones effect at calming the pain likely to be temporary, and should I proceed with a root canal on #15 on Monday? Or is it possible that the prednisone will solve whatever caused that pain to begin with? I need help deciding how to proceed, because I cant take Toradol again for a month (very strict instructions, and the consequences for not following them are life-threatening), and the endo typically doesnt have availability for 5-7 days after calling (at the earliest). I cant handle that level of pain, for that duration, with no relief (if the prednisone doesnt work next time).\n\n*Edited to add: Ive never smoked, and I havent had any alcohol since before this started. I only drink socially and infrequently. \n\nAlso, I dont blame my dentist or anyone else; theyve been wonderful. Weird medical issues, especially involving cranial/facial nerves, arent new for me. I fully believe this problem was prompted by my pre-existing medical issues.'"

namenda,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzodiazepines/comments/3pu7fs/protracted_benzo_withdrawal_syndrome_i_dont/,"b""protracted benzo withdrawal syndrome - I don't believe time is the remedy""",,"b'Disclaimer: Do not consider this medical advice. I am not a doctor. These are just my thoughts from way too much research. My thoughts differ from many who are convinced that time will fix benzodiazepine protracted withdrawal syndrome (PAWS) eventually. I believe that is misguided. But, that is my personal opinion. It\'s not advice, and I cannot advocate anything. But happy to share my findings and thoughts. This is not stuff I came up with on my own. Others share in my thoughts, which I will share now as succinctly as I can.\n\nFor those suffering protracted withdrawal symptoms well after benzo cessation, and who are tired of waiting to feel better, I would suggest two options. And I will explain my reasoning below: \n\n*look into flumazenil and GABA inverse agonists\n\n\n*consider taking a low dose benzo again (I know this one will be met with much disdain)\n\n\n\nI don\'t think long-term benzo use is simply a matter of GABA receptor downregulation. That would be nice, but that does not explain protracted withdrawal symptoms long after cessation, long after GABAR upregulation to homeostasis. \n\n\nThe real issue here, I believe, is that long-term benzo use changes the conformation of the GABA-A receptor. I believe this may be permanent. \n\n\nStudies show cognitive issues and other symptoms may remain permanently after benzo cessation. And look in any of the forums online to see plenty of anecdotal evidence that people are still struggling with various symptoms after a year or more off of benzos. \n\n\nThe best way I can explain this is that with this change in conformation from long-term benzo use, the new conformation of the GABAR site now needs a ""key"" to turn it on to properly activate the GABA system. Benzos are that key. \n\n\nSo, in essence, after benzo use, your GABA system can no longer function normally without a benzo. The new conformation requires the benzo key. Without a key to activate it, symptoms continue indefinitely from a malfunctioning GABA system. \n\n\nThis would explain people\'s continued issues years after quitting. Many people who have suffered through the hell of withdrawal and are off and waiting to feel better are simply stubborn because they are afraid to go on benzos again and be back at square one. I can understand that. I would never want to go through the hell of benzo tapering again. Meanwhile, many of these people, formerly high-functioning while on benzos, are now debilitated and can no longer function - many housebound and unable to hold a job and just waiting for that so-called remedy of time. Shells of themselves, unclear of who they are, suffering depersonalization, derealization, brain fog, cognitive deficits, and memory issues. Experiencing life through a strange new filter, removed, no longer simply present in the here and now. I know because these are all the symptoms I suffered after benzo cessation. I was worthless for over a year and not getting better in time.\n\n\nMeanwhile, flash back to when they were on benzos. They were likely high-functioning. The issues only kick in after benzo cessation. People hold on to the belief thinking they will eventually get better, sacrificing years of their lives for this hope. I do not believe time is the answer. The answer is to reset receptor conformation so that it no longer requires a key to work. \n\n\nThat is where flumazenil comes in. Flumazenil and some other GABA inverse agonists are said to fix the GABA-A receptor conformation. They ""reset"" it back to how it was pre-benzo use. Without that reset, you have a malfunctioning GABA system, and your GABA/Glutamate balance is out of whack. This creates a real Glutamate Storm in the brain which mimics Alzheimer\'s symptoms. With the reset of the receptors, GABA can now function properly without requiring the benzo key for activation.\n\nFor those who have been off of benzos for a while and are still seeking that relief that is not coming, now would be a good time to try flumazenil or another GABA inverse agonist (these are not hard to find if you do a little research). It\'s not recommended for people still on benzos since it is a GABA antagonist. \n\nLike I said, I simply disagree with those who say you just have to ride it out and hope that it gets better in time. I feel sorry for them wasting years of their lives in the misguided hope that time will heal it naturally. I was no longer willing to do that and wanted to regain some control and take action.\n\nI suffered from all the horrific withdrawals after benzo cessation. The depersonalization, derealization, brain fog, and memory issues did not go away with time. I was debilitated for a year and I decided to take matters into my own hands, researching diligently, as I would no longer accept a bad quality of life for an unknown period of time.\n\nI decided to begin taking a low dose of benzos again. Sure enough, all of my symptoms disappeared and I felt absolutely normal again. I\'m sure I have brain damage from the uninhibited glutamate running amok in my brain during my time off of benzos. But nothing that I really notice. I just feel absolutely fine again. And what a relief that has been! Able to highly function again. No longer debilitated and unable to do simple tasks. I am once again a professional, juggling multiple responsibilities at a high level. I am so glad I made this decision.\n\nI will be trying a GABA inverse agonist, potentially flumazenil, at some point in the future when I am tired of taking small doses of benzos daily. For now, this is fine with me. I\'m just so glad I decided to no longer be stubborn to stay off benzos after the hell I went through to get off. I was afraid to be back at square one. I realize in retrospect that I was likely only hurting myself by being stubborn. \n\nI wish I had known how benzos likely permanently alter your GABA receptors before I had gone on it. I never would have taken them to begin with. But it is what is is, and I am happy where I am at now.\n\nHonestly, I believe that benzo cessation can essentially create Alzheimer\'s-like patients. There is all of this talk about how benzo use may cause Alzheimer\'s. I think that is a misguided finding. I believe it is benzo cessation that creates the Alzheimer\'s risk. \n\nNew studies are showing that Benzos actually help improve symptoms of Alzheimer\'s patients. This makes total sense to me. Benzos increase GABA function. This inhibits the glutamate storm in Alzheimer\'s patients. \n\nThere is another way to go about it too. This is only a partial fix. Namenda aka memantine is an NDMA receptor antagonist. This inhibits the glutamate storm. \n\nYour brain needs a GABA/Glutamate balance. GABA inhibits glutamate. Without it, there is no balance. Glutamate runs amok in the brain. I call it a glutamate storm. This causes a great deal of excitoticity (aka brain damage). \n\nI started taking memantine after discovering it while I was off of benzos. I wish I had known about it when I was tapering off benzos. It could have prevented brain damage from the glutamate storm.\n\nI say memantine is only a partial fix because it only addresses half of the issue. Glutamate is more in check. But you still have a malfunctioning GABA system upon benzo cessation. \n\nSo the second fix is to get the GABA system working properly again. Following my hypothesis, this can be done by going back on low-dose benzos again (my current choice) or taking flumazenil or another GABA inverse agonist to reset the receptors so that the benzo key is no longer required for GABA functioning.\n\nI know I repeated myself quite a bit here. It is complicated and just trying to explain by simplifying it as best I can. I know it is still a bit messy though. I hope you get the gist of this and I would love to start a conversation in this threat about this.\n'"

This time nothing helps, and Ive been in pain for almost two months already. I was first diagnosed with the L4-L5 disc bulge several years ago, and according to the latest MRI it has become bigger and has migrated lower, so it started hitting the nerve harder. https://imgur.com/a/G7ufxhl\n\nIve consulted with three doctors, and each of them has a different opinion on how to solve my problem: \n1. The first says just to keep taking NSAIDs and start physical rehabilitation as soon as I feel better. \n2. The second suggests quite a pricy treatment including dry needling, hight intensity magnetic and laser therapy, and plasma injections. All these must help with reducing the pain and resorbing the bulge. \n3. The third offered an epidural steroid injection with X-ray control to resolve the inflammation and swelling locally.  And if it does not help me, trying radiofrequency ablation and modulation of the nerve to stop pain signals to the brain. \n\nThe first option is the cheapest and the easiest but I have been taking NSAIDs for a while, and my pain does not seem to go away, and it worsens if I skip a pill. The second option seems a bit weird since dry needling is associated with muscle pain, and in my case, muscles are not involved as much as the nerve. Laser therapy seems legit, and I have found less info on the magnetic one. The third option seems quite invasive and scary. \n\nBut I need to chose the way to go. \n\nWhich of these options have you tried and what would you choose?'"

Had my first medical emergency where I had to call 911 yesterday.',,"b""So I'm currently in a GPR but moonlight one Saturday a month at an urgent care dental office. I am the only dentist there with one front desk person and two assistants. I had a patient come in that was in 10/10 (he said 15/10...) pain on his lower left and when I walked into the room he was hunched over in the chair holding his face. I took a comprehensive medical hx and he only answered positively for having trouble breathing sometimes due to pectus carinatum and he is allergic to prednisone. He denied anything cardiac related. \n\nHis vitals were a little elevated but nothing I would be worried about. I gave him two IAN blocks and as I was finishing the second carpule he started tapping on his chest saying he felt weird. I did aspirate and there was no blood. He wanted to sit up but I had him stay lying down since he said he was feeling a little bit dizzy. 5 minutes or so goes by and then he sits up saying that he can't breathe and he starts convulsing/shaking non-stop (not a seizure). \n\nHe said nothing like this had ever happened before so I told one assistant to hook up the oxygen and the other to call 911. He then threw up and said he couldn't breathe again. At this point he tells me he has Marfan syndrome. I'll be honest and I couldn't really remember much of anything about it other than the fact that it can have some cardiac implications. I took his vitals again they were once again elevated but nothing that screams he's about to have a cardiac emergency. He said he didn't have any chest pain or chest tightness so I never gave him nitro. \n\nI was basically just sitting there monitoring him on oxygen and his vitals not knowing what else to do other than be ready to start chest compressions if he stopped breathing. He was shaking incessantly this entire time saying he was struggling to breathe. This all happened over a few minutes and then EMS arrived. They did end up taking him to the hospital but I don't know what ever came of it or how I would follow up with him. He was still alert and conscious when he was being wheeled out of the office though. \n\nIdk if there is really any reason I'm writing all this. Kind of just wanted to share since it was a pretty stressful situation for me."""

I\'ve been dismissed by my dentist for, in my opinion, advocating for myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\'m sorry it\'s such a long ride. The events below take place over about ten months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn February, I broke a tooth. I have a military service related back injury, and I collapsed on the floor one morning when a disc ruptured. I clenched my jaw so hard in reaction to the pain that I cracked a molar.\n\nI was in a great deal of pain and taking massive amounts of NSAIDs as well as prescribed hydrocodone. I did not notice any dental pain at the time. For this reason I scheduled a non-emergency appointment. Nonetheless, simply because it\'s excruciating just to walk to the bathroom, in a sense, I make all of my healthcare decisions under duress and am not always the best conversation partner. I explained this, and all of the following, to my dentist and his office staff, and I am certain that they understood what I was telling them.\n\nOver several visits it was established that I would need a root canal and crown. I explained that due to my unique work situation I was very strapped for cash and had just terrible insurance, performance-wise; and would need to be especially prepared for the financial side. He was very helpful, and he showed me how the procedures were billed and exactly what his office charges so that I would know within reasonable limits, barring complications, what I\'d be spending.\n\nWe discussed it at length; and how my insurance company would not pay for a root canal and a crown at the same time; and how if I was willing to play what sounded like a dangerous dance with infection I could do what many of his patients do, get the canal today and fill it, then get the crown next insurance year. But given how terrible my insurance is and how broke I am, I told him getting it extracted was my most realistic option.\n\nHe doesn\'t do extractions. He referred me to another doctor. That doctor was on vacation, so my appointment was scheduled over a month out.\n\nSome time later I got a fever, woke up drenched in sweat, and convinced I had COVID, called into work. The covid test was negative so I assumed it was the flu. My health worsened over the next few days until I was experiencing mental confusion and bizarre thoughts; and it suddenly occurred to me that my tooth (which still had not given me any pain at all) could be infected. This was confirmed by an emergency dentist, who pulled the tooth and prescribed antibiotics.\n\nEverything got better except for my job, which I lost due to the excessive sick time.\n\nBut the emergency dentist knocked out a crown that my regular dentist had made. They reattached it but advised me that without the extracted tooth, things may shift and if the bite was off I should go get it reseated.\n\nAfter all of this... the insurance company screwed it up anyway. And for whatever reason, it was nearly seven months before I found out I still owed the dentist a trivial amount (around $100). I received a ""final notice"" that I discovered in my mailbox on the way home from work. Since I live blocks away, I just got back in the car and walked into the office to pay the bill.\n\n(Bear in mind that I mean trivial *to a dentist*. To me, it means doing without something.)\n\nWhile I was there, I explained that I had not received any prior invoices, and that last I had spoken with the insurance company, it had been my understanding that the insurance claim was still being processed. I also re-iterated how distressing the entire incident had been very distressing to me how I thought I\'d done everything I could to prepare for the expense.\n\nThey can always call me on the phone. I live a block away. The dentist told me twice that *I* can always call *his* phone. Resorting to threatening my credit score is kinda bringing a gun to a fistfight, isn\'t it?\n\nWhile I was there, I said ""I don\'t think I\'m the first person who\'s had a surprise bill,"" to which the receptionist replied, ""no, you\'re not, and you won\'t be the last.""\n\nI said, ""but don\'t you want better?""\n\nShe seemed offended and said, ""excuse me?"" and I did feel bad about that so I clarified, ""I mean, don\'t you want for there to be no patients with billing problems?"" She said ""yes,"" and I tried to reiterate how frustrated it can be to deal with this kind of stuff while in pain. I apologized for ""wrecking their afternoons,"" or something to that effect, and I added ""but please try to understand it\'s wrecking my entire year and still isn\'t over."" I thought they understood and sympathized with me. I even vaguely recall being assured I hadn\'t offended anyone. I later came to gravely regret not recording the conversation myself.\n\n*and on an aside, I honestly do believe that if we all work together there are ways that we can build relationships with our medical providers; and it\'s not in everyone\'s best interests to simply ""do what the computer and policy manual say to do."" Maybe I\'d have explained that more eloquently if I wasn\'t always thinking about whether tonight\'s the night I blow my brains out because I ran out of vicodin.*\n\nMeanwhile I had developed pain in another tooth and because my dentist typically has very long appointment waits I called another nearby dentist who was able to see me that day. His assessment was that the original crown was compromised and that it needed to be replaced. He advised me, however, that it might be possible to remove adhesive and reinstall it without spending $2000, so I should call the dentist who installed it.\n\nThis morning, a number of months after the above took place, I called my dentist to schedule an appointment for the damaged crown. I was put on hold for a few minutes, and the receptionist came back and informed me that I\'d been dismissed as a patient. I asked why, and was told several things:\n\n* The doctor stated that I was ""angry at having to pay my bill""\n* The doctor stated that I ""became irate.""\n* I was being disrespectful to the office personnel.\n\nI then asked if the doctor had stated that I\'d raised my voice, or had used any specific or offensive language, to which the receptionist replied, ""any dentist is permitted to dismiss any patient for any reason?""\n\nI admit this kind of shocked me, and I did say one or two snarky comebacks, such as, ""do you encounter many people who are angry they have to pay their bill?"" and, ""does \\[dismissing patients for any reason\\] sound like good/professional business practice to you?"" But then I pointed out that there were two people in the office at the time, neither of whom was the doctor; and I asked if anyone who was present could comment on my conduct. The other party told me that they were one of those two people, assured me that they had not interacted with me (I distinctly remember making eye contact and thanking them for their patience), and said that they agreed I had been disrespectful and irate. I asked why neither of them had said anything at the time, and the reply I got was, ""I\'m not going to go around in circles on this. A dentist can dismiss you for any reason.""\n\nThey also reminded me multiple times of the ""late"" bill that I paid, in person, within minutes of receiving in my mailbox.\n\nI am also pursuing a registered professional career (engineering). A false record of my conduct stands in my dentist\'s office, which will one day be purchased by a conglomerate and integrated with their database, and I have, at least within a narrow professional sphere, been slandered. But worse yet, I can\'t get my teeth fixed. But underneath it all, it really feels like dismissing patients for systemic problems like billing delays is a very handy way for dentists and doctors to get rid of ""problem patients.""\n\nLet me reiterate that while I am kind of a tough looking guy with a very deep voice, at *no* time did I *raise* my voice or behave in a way that even approaches the definition of ""irate."" I am an engineer with two years experience dealing with ""irate"" buyers chewing me out about supply-chain-related shipment delays.  You can\'t keep the pedal to the floor 100% of the time.\n\nAlso: why was I dismissed today, while making an appointment, and not months ago when I was allegedly being ""irate""?\n\nSo esteemed dentists of Reddit, was my dentist\'s conduct appropriate? Was he fair and respectful? Does this warrant a complaint to the NYS Office of Professional Discipline?\n\nOr AITA for what I thought was doing my best to advocate for myself?\n\nThird option (sorry for all the edits. I am honestly a little upset over this. He\'s a good dentist): is there any way I can work this out with him? I honestly do not think this is an option given how I was treated by his office staff. I don\'t think it would be fair to force them to deal with me now that they\'ve made their opinions clear to me.'"
codeine,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/11jgyv8/sciatica_2020_now/,b'Sciatica 2020 > now',Image437,"b'I (35 M) am currently really suffering with a flare up of sciatica. I hope by sharing my story I might get some support and advice from fellow sufferers.\n\nI am very active person: football, running, walking. I was out hillwalking in 2020 when I overstretched crossing a burn. I thought Id pulled my hamstring at first, as the pain increased (despite rest) over the next few weeks, I then wondered if the hamstring was torn. Being a somewhat typical man, I hadnt sought medical advice yet\n\nI had to get advice when the pain just became unbearable over the course of another few weeks. I was then prescribed the strongest co-codamol and these helped greatly. I also got referred to physio but decided to take workplace physio as it would be much quicker to get an appointment. I didnt find this very helpful as it was telephone consultations due to the Covid lockdown. I ended up getting a face-to-face consultation with another physio through a football contact and he was fantastic. I was given exercises to strengthen around my glutes, hamstring, hips. These all worked and although progress was slow, I was getting better.\n\nThe physio believed I had some kind of pinch in my nerve due to the way my muscles developed through years of playing sports. I am going to be asking for a general review of this opinion shortly.\n\nBy autumn 2021 I was back playing football and running again.\n\nFast forward to Christmas 2022, out of nowhere, with nothing I can pinpoint, or any warning signs, it came back with a vengeance. Initially, it was manageable, I immediately got referred back to physio. I had a couple of sessions, got a new exercise / stretching regime, some of which Id kept up from 2020 anyway. I even have the same resistance band Id been regularly using from that time for my glute exercises. Recovery seemed to be going well.\n\nHowever, on Tuesday last week, I was walking down the stairs at home and just felt a blinding pain and spasm in my left leg. I had to phone my partner to come home from work early as I couldnt watch my little one safely. The pain was worse than ever, still seeming to emanate from my hamstring, but also in my buttocks, glutes, down my lower leg - the worst pain I have ever experienced. Non prescription pain relief just wasnt having any effect. I wasnt able to do any of my stretches at all either.\n\nIve been off work since and have been so reliant on my partner. I know I am very lucky in that regard. On Tuesday night, I barely slept, the pain just kept me awake and I absolutely took more painkillers than I should have.\n\nWednesday morning, the doctor prescribed Naproxen and strong co-codamol. I felt a difference, particularly during the day, but at night again I was awake at 1am and 5am. I tried sleeping on the couch, the bed, the spare bed, the floor! Pillows under me, between my legs, etc, etc. Lots of googling that night.\n\nThursday, I got a different doctor. He told me to park the cocodamol and try valium and amitriptyline instead. One tablet of amitriptyline didnt really seem to do anything but the valium certainly loosened me up both mentally and physically! It was better, but still not great and I am seeing 4/5am like clockwork every morning. I have also reintroduced cocodamol which the doctor told me I could do, but to be extremely mindful of this due to its interactions with the other medications. I feel fine and have had no side effects, which is a blessing.\n\nOther things I am doing when I can: very light stretching, trying to walk a little every so often, hot baths with salts, deep freeze, deep heat, bags of peas, compression band (joint waist and leg one). \n\nTonight, I am switching my Naproxen to before bed and also taking my amitriptyline then too instead of at 8pm. If I can sleep through the night I will be delighted. I will be phoning the GP at 8am and I have physio on Thursday too, so will be seeking professional advice then too.\n\nIt feels good to get this down in writing - cathartic! Apologies its so long.\n\nI wonder if anyone has experience of similar medications and trying to get their consumption times correct? Also other medication options? As both GPs have asked what I was thinking, and both times I was a bit unprepared for that question!?\n\nAny opinions on CBD based creams? I am not sure if that stuff is snake oil!\n\nAny other hints, tips, and suggestions gratefully received!\n\nThanks for reading\n\nUPDATE: \n\n- After one week of pretty much crippling pain, I woke up in a much better state and so far (4pm) my symptoms are suddenly much milder. Last night was the first night I slept through the night but 30mg of Amitriptyline and 60mg of codeine certainly would have helped that\nI have only taken my anti-inflammatory so far today as a result. I really dont like how the codeine makes me feel and know how dangerous it can be to take these for prolonged periods of time. I am going to walk to the shops shortly, and intend to have a hot bath with salts. I cant pinpoint exactly what might have changed, I have flung the kitchen sink at it, but I am going to keep it all up. I am under no illusions that it may return tomorrow, or next week, etc\nI will take codeine tonight and tomorrow (only one tablet) before bed, as I really cant handle lack of sleep and thats when its at its worst, but I intend (all going well) to take none Friday - Sunday and possibly even return to work on Monday.\nOne day at a time though, and I wont be phased by setbacks thanks to all your help, advice, and support!'"

Well, I have been taking codeine for 2.5 years to eliminate and support joint and bone pain which has been a common problem for me since I was young (noone can tell me why). I was told it was growing pains and that it would stop, it didn't.\n\nCould all of this be because of heyfever/dust or some other allergy that has been missed?\n\nI've requested an allergy test as per the pharmacist that I spoke to, so I'll keep you posted. Thought it was interesting to see that perhaps all of these things are tied together. I don't want to get my hopes up but how bloody great would it be if all that stuff disappears, just from the right allergy treatment!!!\n\nAnyone have an experience of this sort of thing? I'd be interested to see how common those symptoms are."""

Before this I was fairly active, going to the gym 4-6 days a week (which was also my study), working in the yard etc. \nLast year however I had COVID twice and influenza once. December was my last bout of COVID. And that's when things changed for me. After I recovered from COVID I no longer had any energy. Fatigue has been a constant issue for me. I don't feel tired, just exhausted. I haven't been back to the gym at all since. \n\nI went to see my GP in March to try to figure out what was happening. He took my bloods (twice), nothing showed up abnormal (infact he said they looked better than the last time I'd seen him the previous year). He tested me for a range of wacky diseases like lupus and Q-fever because of our location. And he gave me a mental health screening. \n\nThe results of all his tests were a diagnosis of depression and anxiety. No physical abnormalities, though he suggested it may be long COVID. Since then I have been seeing a psychologist for these mental issues, but physically I still feel off.\n\nHe did suggest exercise for the long COVID but it really hasn't helped me. \n\nThe best way I can describe it is like a weakness in my muscles. Any time I try to do something requiring any strength it feels like I've just finished a workout. It takes longer for my muscles to recover, and i have to sit or lay down for a while to feel ok again. And my fitness is obviously a lot worse from not being able to work out. \n\nSome extras just in case:\n \nI use a vape daily \n\nI smoke weed fairly regularly at night but have been doing this for years on and off, so it's not something new to me\n\nWas taking supplements like: multi vitamins, vitamin d, probiotics, magnesium. \nHowever not on them currently \n\nAny ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Breathing was a little fast they said and I was very clammy. They gave me 8mg Zofran for the Nausea which helped instantly. \n\n\\- neck still stiff, fever reduced. Headache very prevalent still.

I came across meningitis when reading about the neck and headache thing with flu symptoms on google, and read it can be very dangerous. \n\nI am now concerned that I could have had meningitis, and just didn't catch it. I feel i am on the tail end of whatever this is (my doctor didnt know but thinks it is viral), however I am still worried if it is meningitis that there can be longer term effects. \n\nThe reason I think it might not be meningitis, and just maybe I slept on my neck wrong is that while i did stretch one time which made it worse, stretching another time (later in the week), made it better which wouldnt happen with meningitis i dont think. The pain did come back swiftly, but that can be casued by a lot of things. Also no one i know has had meningitis.\n\nThe reason i think it could be meningitis is because the neck seemed to be linked to that terrible headache. I have never had headache pain like that. it surrounded my entire head from my eyebrows, forehead, back of head, and hurt incredibly bad near the back of the head where the neck comes it. It SUCKED! some moments I could not stand up and rarely sleep.  \n\nAt the moment, I was so concered with not having COVID that I bushed these symptoms off to flu or caused by myoclonus or sleeping wrong. \n\nI have been rapidly getting better since yesterday afternoon, so I do not think there is a lot of cause for alarm, but I am more worried about any long term effects that meningitis could cause. \n\nAre there any thoughts? Regardless, I am going to call my doctor on monday and let him know about this but I wanted to put it out here first. \n\nThanks."""

I also suffer from type 1 rosacea and chronic acne(mostly on my back). Most of my life I have been good about wearing sunscreen when outdoors but as I got older my skin conditions kept getting worse. I just sort of gave up in my late twenties and kind of fell into a rut and stopped caring. My face, scalp, and chest were constantly red and flakey. My acne would be very cystic and often form into boils.\n\nEarly 2019 is when I began to put effort into my appearance, ate better, got back in shape, and started seeing a dermatologist. I have kept my skincare routine as simple as possible as my rosacea flares from so many common ingredients. It took me damn near 9 months to work my way up to nightly 0.025% tretinoin cream. I am currently 6 months into a 12 month course of low dose accutane and had to cut back on the tret. My derm said to keep up the tret use if it's not causing irritation. Hardly any sides from the accutane other than a slight dip in energy and occasionally get dry lips. \n\nProcedures: \n    I had 5 rounds of Vbeam last year for my flushing and redness. It helped significantly, but I should have waited until after my accutane course as now I flush more than ever.\n\nMedications/Routines:\n-Cosentyx 300mg injection every month for sebo-psoriasis\n-Ketoconazole shampoo 3x week\n-Metronidazole gel 0.75% every other AM\n-Accutane 30mg daily\n-tretinoin cream 0.025% every other night\nSodium sulfacetamide 10/5% wash\nVanicream lotion\nEucerin 50spf sunscreen \n\nAM: rinse off with water in shower,  air dry face and hair. metronidazole gel followed by Eucerin Sun Allergy protect 50spf.\n\nPM: oil cleanse before stepping in shower. Wash face with sodium sulfacetamide wash(this has been a game changer, helps both acne AND seb derm). After shower I use vanicream lotion followed by CeraVe healing ointment around my eyes and lips, followed by the tretinoin. After about 30 minutes I will usually put on more vanicream lotion.\n\nFYI the handlebar mustache was only a thing for a few days for meme purposes."""

Seen a oncologist/hematologist preformed a bone marrow biopsy found I have MGUS. I have seen/still currently see a Rheumatologist which is who did suggested that we test for amyloidosis. Test was negative. Have been tested for hereditary angieodema also negative. Have been tested for a wide range of allergies all came back negative. My heavy light chains are low but oncologist insist that it is no need to worry my bone marrow didnt suggest any cancer or etc. \n\nCurrent health issues:\n-Lupus (controlled) I take Plaquenil and Celebrex as needed for pain.  \n-Celiac - controlled by diet \n-Eczema -controlled - steroid cream when necessary \n-Arthritis (mild) \n\nBelow is the notes from the last appt. \n\n\nDDx: histamine-mediated angioedema, episodic angioer eosinophilia, bradykinin-angioedema, Melkersson-Roser syndrome.\nFeatures of her history could suggest angioedema, but swelling daily is not typical as these conditions are episodic  persistent. She has had previous allergy evaluation and alpha gal sensitization, however avoidance of mammalia over a year did not resolve symptoms. Previous lab test with differential, tryptase, TSH, C1Q, C4, C1INH total/fur returned normal. In the context of her history of MGUS, angioedema with eosinophilia (Gleich syndrome) is a consideration. Response to steroids suggests histamine-mediated angioedema. Also in differential is Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome given sx of orofacial edema, recurrent peripheral palsy (tongue numbness) \n Provided future lab orders for CBC with differential and C4 to be  drawn during acute attack\n Expand evaluation with testing for bradykinin-angioedema given isolated swelling\n Response to prednisone still leads me to suspect histamine-mediated process most likely. (I responded to high doses of prednisone but it negatively effected me in other ways) \n Discussed that she had only received 4 doses, and we would expect benefit by 3 months, in some instances it may take up 6 months of therapy. Talked about continuing for another 3 months to fully assess response and patient has agreement with proceeding. Xolair 300 mg PFS for administration. She prefers at home given distance from office. She would be an appropriate candidate for at-home. \n\n\n*Started on Xolair 8/29/22 and received monthly not sure if Xolair has made difference. Almost every time after dose administered her tongue would swell. Tolerated the injection no known reaction. Only thing she noticed was a headache. Prior to onset of tongue swelling, she will get chest pair short of breath. This will precede several of her swelling episodes.  Review of pictures shows multiple of the episodes angioedema. Also, only left side of tongue has swollen. Most of the time.  Evaluated for amyloidosis, has had bone marrow biops been negative/normal. (Did find that i have MGUS)\nHas sought advice from Dentist and etiology not known. \nFrequency: once a week\nReports previous tests of D-Dimer during acute attack is. persistently elevated.\nTherapies tried; Zyrtec 10 mg BID, Pepcid 20 mg BID, Singulair, hydroxyzine.

She was super resistant to meds at first, but eventually agreed to take them, which struck me as odd.\n\nI have an undergrad psych degree and no problem with administering prescribed meds as directed by a licensed physician, but my mom though.  She\'s become more and more of a crunchy granola type as she\'s gotten older.  She\'s always been pretty anti psychoactive meds/pharma (except the meds she likes/uses like Advil, Tramadol, and a handful of others ... consistency is not her strong suit).  She also loves my kids like crazy and sees them most weekends so my wife and I can get a date night in.  I can\'t stress enough how sweet and loving she is though.  She\'s really the archetypal grandma in many ways right down to baking and spoiling them.\n\nAnyway, I talked with her on the phone about my kid\'s diagnosis and she got all sad and started talking about zombie kids and how she was disappointed.  That one I pushed back on.  ""Disappointed in what, mom?"" I asked her.  And I told her that if she wants to watch the kids, she needs to give her meds as prescribed, full stop.  Anyway she continued to be all sad and morose at me telling me that my daughter\'s behavior wasn\'t so bad but like ... people, it\'s pretty clear if you watch her.  Eventually my daughter mentioned that her negative attitude toward meds may have come from her grandmother.\n\nAnyway, I\'m feeling super anxious right now and worried for my girl.  I love her so damn much, and I just want her to be able to be okay in school and able to focus.  Have any of you had positive experiences with meds in grade school? Am I doing the right thing?\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nEdit: Hey all, just wanted to express my gratitude for how many of you have taken the time to share.  It\'s been a big help.'"

Due to the crippling anxiety I was experiencing and out of desperation to bring some emotional balance in my day to day, I decided to try antidepressants again.

I live in BC and have had such a horrendous and traumatizing experience with the healthcare system here. \n\nMy journey started last November (2022) with Zoloft and I was on it for about 2 months. The side effect that I couldnt handle was the drowsiness regardless if I took it at night, Id still feel incredibly lethargic throughout the day. I was like this for 2 whole months. I went to a walk-in doctor once again and they put me on Effexor (37.5mg) lowest dose. At first it was fine, but after a few weeks, the doctor recommended I increase my dosage to fully benefit from its effects. After reading some stories from people coming off it, I was hesitant to agree and decided to keep being on the lowest dose. 4 months in, I noticed experiencing low mood/energy and didnt feel like doing anything at all. So I talked to another walk-in doctor and we said ok lets try Wellbutrin. I was worried because he said I could do a direct switch and that Id be fine. He did not let me know that there was still a possibility for me to experience any kind of withdrawals. For 14 whole days, I have been helpless. Ive never felt this horrible in my entire life. These past few days I havent been able to keep anything down, constant vomiting and nausea. No available walk-in appointments. Went to urgent care last weekend which gave me some relief, and the doctor prescribed me with Lexapro to take with Wellbutrin, but none for my nausea. After this experience, I think this will be the last time Ill ever be on antidepressants. I had to take time off work. Spoke to the doctor yesterday that recommended the direct switch, told him everything thats been going on and all he said was to take ginger gravol and to find a family doctor. Mind you, Ive tried every possible thing to aid my nausea, but I still end up vomiting. Havent been able to eat anything these past 4 days.

Anyways as more research came out and the world learned about the negative side effects of long term benzo use my doctor ripped my prescription away and I was left not sleeping at all on average about 4 days in a row. I thought it would get better over time but it never did and I\'ve landed in the er multiple times from psychosis, blood pressure so high I was at risk of cardiac arrest and not to mention I haven\'t been able to attend school, hold down a job and my insomnia is now affecting my social life and destroying my mental health leading to many nights of contemplating suicide. I\'ve tried years of therapy, CBT, CBT-I, tried years of safer longterm use medications that help with insomnia but all they do is make me extreemly tired but they don\'t stop my brain that spins 1000 mph all night so I end up being exhausted and still wide awake wishing I could sleep.ive done rehab for dependency but ended up going into psychosis and back in the er. I\'ve worked on cbt techniques, meditation, exercise, natural supplements and nothing phases me my mind seems to overpower the will to sleep. I ended upselfmedicating xanax 1mg every night  and it worked for a good while, I wasable to sleep, I never increased the dose, I helddown a job for almost a full year and was evenable to get into a relationship. I was happy but Iknew that I couldn\'t keep this up for the rest ofmy life because I feared I eventually I would get caught,and also the big thing was i picked up 100 xanax from a new connect and they ended up being\npure fet, which led to me becoming addicted to opiates. Anyways I\'m 6 months clean from opiates and I\'m in iop and after explaining my story my therapist and counselor said that at this point it would be the lesser of two evils to be prescribed an effective sleeping medication like ambien, lunesta, or a benzo specifically for sleep than to live the rest of my life sleep deprived, in and out of the er, and all the other dangers of sleep deprivation\nhave an appointment this week with a primary care doctor, what would be the best way to convince this doctor that I need to be on an effective sleep medication for life, because at this point I am desperate for sleep and either I am monitored under a doctor with this\nmedication or I go back to self medication and accept the consequences. 10+ years of torture.

There was nothing explicitly wrong but due to constant pain it was removed and I had an implant done. The dentist at the time (who has since retired) said it may be a genetic issue seeing as it was the same tooth just on opposite sides. \nI just had my second baby in January. About 4 weeks after my baby was born the implants started bothering me. The one on the left became loose and it was discovered that the implant failed so I had it removed and had a bone graft done. However, a problem remains on the right side. The pain is achey, mostly dull but overwhelming at times. It doesnt feel like sharp tooth pain like a cavity but rather an overall pain stemming from that area. It radiates behind my check above the tooth and up to my inner eye. I massage above my teeth/cheek and around my eye for relief along with taking Advil or Aleve to help with the pain. I dont want to keep taking medicine to help and Im feeling like the only option is to have this remaining implant removed, however its not failing which was confirmed when the other failed implant was identified.

No numbness or tingling, but a tightness to my jaw. This resolved within an hour and I thought nothing of it. It happened again a couple days later, and I decided to go to urgent care next door to my work. They checked my vitals and for signs of a stroke, said it was just my anxiety, and sent me on my way.

I am extremely concerned, since getting blind(-ish) is one of my major fears.  \nI have also upped the dose of my bupropion since 5 days (also per agreement) and I don't know if it's contributing.

This neuropathy had mostly disappeared after switching to a low carb high fat grain free ketogenic diet almost three years ago.

I was dirious... at around had intense chest paint heart pain and anxiety. At 1 months of covid I... lost the ability of sleep... . I never felt asleep again... but all sleep medications worked for a few hours. \n    I then figured out most of my psychological problems came from sam-e because I would be catatonic with out then from 2 days then felt better when I took it but then anxiety the next day... \n   I finally decided to take zoloft again at a low dose of 3 mg and stop sam-e.. I had intense withdrawl of non stop vomiting for 2 days. And then got better...

I don't drink or smoke and I exercise between 3-4 times a week. \n\nThe pain feels like someone's placing a book on the center part of my chest from time to time. It comes and goes. The feeling does not go away when laying down on a bed or the couch. In fact, that's when I feel it most. \n\nI have no trouble sleeping. Breathing is easy unless I'm taking deep breaths. I stopped exercising this week because I don't want to over exert myself and potentially cause more damage. \n\nI've also set up an appointment with my PCP for next week but I'm wondering if someone here has experienced this after taking the first dose of the Moderna vaccine.

My whole body would fall weak, especially my muscles. It caused dyskinesia, which is uncontrollable muscle spasm and agitation. It was extremely uncomfortable and affected my mood and sleep. I would get severe insomnia and extreme fatigue at the same time. At first I'd fall into complete fatigue, extremely tired and exhausted. My muscles would continue to spasm and cause cramps. I'd lie in bed for days not getting up. Then days would follow of insomnia and not being able to sleep. After trying it the thoughts in my head got so much worse and constant. They became obsessive and more aggressive. I even had an episode of bad spasms. I could not possibly sit still or lie down yet I was so tired and struggled to keep moving. I was on an airplane and started going up and down the aircraft screaming I needed an ambulance. Since I was a minor and my guardian didn't authorise to get off the airplane I was stuck. That went on for a long period of time while they were fixing the aircraft. It even caused my jaw muscles to start moving and do weird things to my face. I ended up having to take 8 lorazepam pills to relax me. The effects continued to last for days after. Horrible experience, will literally make me pass out anywhere. My psychiatrist was insisting on continuing taking it and I tried it multiple times but is still a horrible experience."""

ABOUT 18 months ago, I became very ill physically then felt totally burnt out.  I think it started early in the year when ai started a permanent job with long shift hours. Then unfortunately, I experienced workplace violence from a client.  It was frightening.  Another worker, male, was with me, trying to get the client off me but the assault felt like it went on for a long time.  I had to go to A&E.  Doctors said I must never work with that client again, that I was very lucky I was not injured more severely.\n\nI had to go off on WorkCover.  I told management that whilst I was very keen to return to work promptly, I could not work with that client again.  I had professional medical backing on this.\n\nI was offered another position.  I did not think this out adequately.  I believe I wanted to prove to everyone that ai am okay, not a failure or incompetent.  The client, a very strong, tall and well-built young woman with intellectual and mental health disabilities had an unexpected meltdown due to COVID lockdown and not being able to see her family. She physically attacked another client, and when I had gone to that clients assistance, she turned on me.\n\nAnyway, the other job U took had a terrible roster which required me to sleep at work 4 nights every second week, do split shifts, long shifts and the work culture between workers was cluwuey and aggressive. One night, I had virtually no sleep after having to call paramedics to a client through the night. I had also been caring for people who were CIVID positive, having to wear full Ppe in stinking heat.\n\nWithin a few days I became very ill and was diagnosed with Influenza A, experiencing delirium, very high and low blood pressure and even urinary incontinence.  It took a month to recover.  Within a few days of returning to work, I contracted COVID and of course couldn\'t work for a week.\n\nI had the usual other things happening, elderly mother with dementia and poor health, my senior dog needing a lot if care and then passing.  Lot of other things most of us experience \n\nI finally decided after having COVID to work casually and it\'s been a good decision.  I will be 64 this year.  I am managing to work around 30 hours a week and take much better care if myself.\n\nI was reading recently about ADHD and the cycle if iver-commiting and then burning out.  This is something ai have done most of my life.  I think it\'s largely because of my self-esteem.  I\'m trying to be ""as good as other people, as worthy  and capable as them"".  In my mind, the only way I can achieve this is to work so hard that at some point, U come tumbling down and am then useless for a while.\n\nI simply cannot do it anymore.'"

Thats why I am very motivated to get some answers from my rheumatologist. \n\nWhat do the medical professionals of Reddit make of this? What should I be asking about? \n\ncould the WBC have come down with antibiotics by accident? Or does there definitely have to be an infection for that to happen? \n\nAlso, is it even possible for there to have been a mild infection and then an autoimmune condition caused my body to freak out and make too many white blood cells? \n\nFinally, I spoke with a virtual care doc today who couldnt really answer my questions but did give me a rec for CBC & CRP to check up on WBC. \n\nThank you in advance for your thoughtful responses '"

Tetracycline,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/ulrrib/i_am_so_tired/,b'I Am So Tired',,"b""I AM SO TIRED\n\nI am so tired of struggling with acne. I have been fighting this fight for more than two decades. I am so tired.\n\nI am so tired of looking in the mirror literally hundreds of times a day. Investigating every little crevasse and corner, every shade and nuance, every slight bump, every cyst, everything. Under every conceivable types of lighting, in front of every mirror at home, at school, at work, at the cafe, at my family's house. Worrying over every change, every new arrival, every old arrivals too, stuff from three weeks ago that still shows discoloration. I know the topography of my face better than satellite images could ever know the Earth. \n\nI am so tired of the routine, that careful use of cleanser, medicine, product, moisturizer, sun screen, make-up, every morning, every evening, every shower. It must be weighed and applied to perfecting otherwise it will destroy my face more than it is already destroyed. Or so I tell myself. \n\nI am so tired of watching everything I eat, everything I drink, everything I touch, for fear that it might affect my acne. They say there is no solid evidence diet affects acne but I swear, 20 years of dealing with this shit, if I so much as think about cake or candy or pastries or soda or alcohol or cheese or white rice or anything, my face breaks out like some Kool and the Gang anthem. And of course any change for the worse is a cause for temporary episodes of depression. Or permanent ones.\n\nI am so tired of spending every waking hour of every day concerned about my face. About how that little bump will look at what distance, what people will think about me. But mostly what I think about myself. I am scared to look at people before I've done my routine in the morning, even my kids. How the fuck are they to understand it. I try to smile but I can't. \n\nI am so tired of the cover-up. Of agonizing over finding the right of concealer and matte creme and God knows what - always comedogenic, oil free, no perfume, containing none of 1600 different ingredients that could upset that delicate balance of oil and moist and bacteria on my face. Hundreds of dollars each, of course, because why should reducing your crippling acne-induced depression be cheap. \n\nI am so tired of the medicines. I have tried antibiotics - three different kinds of benzoyl peroxide treatments, plus tetracycline. I have tried retinoids, I have tried azelaic acid - two different treatments, you name it. I have tried isotretinoin (that's Accutane to you Americans), two rounds of one year. I have tried ivermectin (no not to treat covid, Jesus Christ). Sure it has reduced my acne from insane levels in my teens but how the fuck can I be turning 40 having exhausted all medical options. That makes me so tired.\n\nI am so tired of the side-effects. The redness, the itching, the dryness, your liver might be permanently fucked.\n\nI am so tired of doctors saying it's not so bad. It's fucking bad. It's a medical problem but yes it's also a psychological problem. I tried extended therapy treatment with a psychologist. It was okay. It didn't really make much of a different. It just made me more tired, so tired.\n\nI am so tired of the summer and that damned sun. Sun exposure can temporarily improve your acne. But long term it makes it massively worse. Fucking great. I haven't left the shade in twenty years. You know how hard that makes any type of popular summer vacation? It's like trying to dodge landmines in a war zone.\n\nI am so tired of withdrawing from everything. The number of social events I have declined because of acne is innumerable. Even when I'm there, if my acne's bad, I try to hide. I don't look at anyone. I spend hours in the bathroom. I sit in the corner looking at my phone to avoid interaction. I'm a grown fucking person! I shouldn't have to do this. But I have to. Apparently.\n\nI AM SO TIRED"""

I do live in Ohio, where we now have a 6 week abortion ban. Even though I'm surprised, I really want to keep this baby. However I can't shake the feeling that something could be wrong and I may need an abortion. I explained to the nurse in the phone, I had concerns, and what they were.

Also, no matter what anyone says it wont change the outcome, I want to die so very bad, but my stupid brain is doing everything it can to keep me from that edge. \n\nI randomly because super happy and hopeful and it just resets me, then in a matter of minutes Im right back to spiraling down extreme sadness, anger, and borderline insanity. Every time I hit my breaking point, I get reset. I finally got prescribed Lithium to control my emotional swings but I fear its too little too late. My family would let me live with them for free if worst came to worse, but I cannot do that, I cannot be the disappointment that I tried for so long to prove I am not. I just cant, yes maybe it would be smart to do that but what the fuck is smart really? Its a self preservation instinct, the likes of which I wish I didnt have, I wish I could be dead.\n\nHowever, I know that Im to scared to actually go through with it in any effective way (I.E gun, knife, jumping from a building) Ive tried killing myself a few times, I took 7 times the lethal dose of acetaminophen, 350mgs of hydrocodone, and while being very drunk. Not only that I continued drinking after I took all that. Not only did it not work, it has lead me closer to loosing the small amount of control in my life. \n\nI just wish I would have a heart attack or stroke that kills me, or at very least a brain aneurysm that changes me completely to where anything could happen and I just dont care. The problem is, I care too much in a world that could care less about me. I have so much hope and I see the future as a bright place. Despite deep down knowing that it isnt. \n\nI will no longer freak out at the fact that people wont wake up and realize it because that is impossible, it is out of our control, WE ARE SLAVES. Slaves to our hormones, instinct, and life itself. We stay alive because our brains will not let us die, the people who actually commit suicide do it out of impulse. Sometimes they succeed, most of the time they fail. The ones that succeed are the lucky ones, I wish that they didnt have to go through that because dying has to be one of the worst experiences ever until it is done.\n\nIf there was a button I could push that would just instantly atomize me I would ouch it so quickly. Like how those Youtubers tell us to smash that like button I would smash the ever-loving-frick out of that instant death button. I know Ill never do it because I am a coward. People try to tell me the fact Im still alive means that there is still hope like thats supposed to make it better. It doesnt, the hope is another word for our saying your body and mind still want to live so let it \n\nWell I dont care if my vessel wants me to live, my consciousness wants to cease. Thats all I want, so screw what my biological functions want, they are stupid, my vessel is programmed for positivity, programmed for hope. It wont let me die without a fight that will ultimately cause me more suffering. I have no ambitions anymore, I do not want a family, money (other than to just be at peace), power, a partner, nothing. I just want eternal sleep. Thats my paradise, sleep, nothingness. So please, save me the whole speech of itll get better or youre too young to die because it helps no one but you. Making you feel better about trying to talk someone down. \n\nI know people are going to do it anyway because youre humans and thats just what humans do. We are just animals, overly intelligent animals, but still animals. I am writing this to basically be my autobiography. Not for sympathy or support. I write this so that maybe it can help my family understand that it isnt their fault, nothing they could have done would have saved me. I am sorry, I truly am.'"

I picked it up again for what was the 3rd time because I had a reaction to Scopolamine which completely shut off my bladder. I needed to pee via catheter on my bathroom floor, and I have extreme anxiety about things going up there. When I was diagnosed with IC in 2012, they started shoving things up there: cameras, catheters, that *sliced* me. My first urologist sent me to my shrink for Valium so they could jam catheters up me without me screaming and crying. I quit after two weeks out of fear of addiction. The second time, in winter 2012-2013, I was on 10 mg/day for a month then 20 mg a day for 3 weeks. I cold turkeyed that shit and 18 days later had THE panic attack that largely ruined whatever life I had left. Back to August 2014. The catheterizations gave me a UTI, which freaked me out because I'd recovered from IC and didn't want to go back. I also had to take Macrobid, which, combined with my Scopolamine, turned my poop to rocks. I injured a cluster of nerves in my groin and relied heavily on Valium to deal with that pain (it ruined my ability to stand and stretch). I kept taking it because it also really helped my chronic pelvic pain and spasms and kept me chill about school and the long, ugly death of a 5 year relationship with my fianc. I promised I'd quit in December 2014, but instead, I picked up drinking on top of it. Now I don't even enjoy drinking unless I throw a Valium down first. And yes, I often go way too far with this, but it's the only way I can go numb from the pain. I've never been a really anxious person. My demon is depression. But I know from the panic attack in February 2013 that benzo withdrawal is some of the scariest shit one can go through. I can't keep putting off my taper. My ex doctor recommended going down to 2.5 mg for a month, then 1mg for a month, then stopping. Another former doctor suggested I switch to 1 mg Ativan 2x a day, then go down to 0.5 mg 2x a day. When I take Ativan, I feeling *nothing.* It's like the drug doesn't work on me. Neither of these approaches seem safe enough to me. I've largely been using 5 mg/day of Valium, but sometimes 10 if I need extra pain management. I'm getting botox for my muscles and guided nerve blocks, and assuming that can manage my pain (ha!) how awful of a mental/emotional ride will I be in for? And how long will the stupids last?

No preexisting conditions, southern USA, white, about 5\'11"" and 145 lbs. On Thursday and Friday last week he stated he was tired and wanted to go to bed early. I thought this was unusual but I figured he had not got enough sleep that week. Saturday morning he had a fever. for the next few days I assumed he had a cold until Monday when he started to break out in rash and pimples on his arms, legs, chest and face. \n\nWe suspected staph, which he confirmed at a doctor\'s appointment on Tuesday. he works as a commercial electrician and received a cut last week which we think is the cause. Dr said take Bactrim DS tablets 1 by mouth 2x a day for 10 days and kelfex 500mg every 12 hours for 10 days. one antibiotic was for potential strep, but his culture was negative for strep. only positive for staph. \n\n\nI\'ve also given him day and night theraflu and acetaminophen for pain and fever, and vitamin C supplements. I\'ve also put cool rags on his head and chest to try to keep the fever down but it always ends up shooting back up.\n\n\nI\'m also concerned about how contagious he is at this point, to myself and my 10 year old son. I\'ve shared a bed with him the entire time but we have avoided intimacy or touching, and have washed clothes/towels daily and sheets every few days. my son and I have no symptoms at this point.\n\nnow we are on day 6. this is day 3 of antibiotics and really no change. He still has the marks, his eyes are bloodshot and most of the time his temperature is in the 102 range. It has been as low as 98 and as high as 103.3 this past week. He has had upset stomach and diarrhea I guess due to the antibiotics. low appetite but has attempted to eat. normally responsive, sleeping OK, good attitude. mild body aches. \n\n\n\nmy concern is how long he has had a fever. I tried to ask the ER if he should come in and they said they can\'t advise me over the phone. I worry it may or already has entered his blood, I don\'t know how to tell if he is getting better because it seemed nothing has changed. any advice or experience with this would be greatly appreciated. thank you!!!!'"

penicillin,https://www.reddit.com/r/headaches/comments/g4urno/ive_significantly_reduced_my_tension_headaches/,"b""I've significantly reduced my Tension Headaches""",,"b'A little backstory, my tension headaches would usually start when I woke up. It would be a tightness or tension feeling in my neck, right below the skull. It would slowly build throughout the day and I was always unable to relief it. I would try, and it would rise to the the top of my skull into a painful headache where I\'d need to lay down. I used to try to beat it whenever I got it. But realized it was better to just take headache medicine. I was only really taking it 1-2 times a week, I believe. I developed an allergy to Ibuprofen and switched to Aleve. The Aleve took way longer to kick in so I felt more pain. When we feel pain we want to fix it, so I spent years trying to figure it out. \n\nI believe I have solved it for the most part and I don\'t know specifically what fixed it so I will tell you what changed for me. \n\nFirst, telling myself to sit up straight was not working. My posture is awful and I think it\'s a big factor for tension headaches. \n\nHere\'s what I started doing: \n* Strength training regularly (calisthenics, kettlebell, weights)\n* Using a Standing desk way more at work\n* Yoga for posture (lots of playlists for 5, 10 minutes)(I recently fell out of this but doesn\'t seem to have an effect yet)\n* Running every other day to relieve tension\n* I have a nice heating pack (with rice) that I warm up and lay on my shoulders throughout the day. It feels so good!\n* The change that had the biggest impact IMO or maybe just topped it off was Not using a pillow AND sleeping on my back. I went through 8 different pillows and eventually switched to no pillow, but ALSO I went from a side sleeper to a back sleeper. This was Tough! I was willing to get no sleep for it though and still catch myself on my Side sometimes. \n\n**UPDATE**\nStill sleeping on my back, but I have also believe the cardio needs to be highlighted. Making sure extra tension/stress is burned off is very important. I bike 8 miles every other day or so. (~30 minutes) My nails are growing (I\'ve always chewed them off from anxiety/stress), my jaw is no longer tense from grinding, and my neck is not tense when I wake up. Seriously, add exercise to your lifestyle and add some more. Train safely and work your way up. This will become a lifestyle for you because every time you don\'t want to do some cardio you should be thinking of your worse tension headache or night of teeth grinding. \n\n**EDIT** I have a memory foam topper for my mattress so my head sinks into it a little bit. I think it\'s 3 inch. So you still may need a really thin memory foam pillow. Sleep on my back may be the most crucial.\n\nBut if you look at how you side sleep you curl up. So I was ""hunched"" 8 hours at work and 6-8 hours while sleeping. \n\nMy tension headaches only come back if I sit on the couch and game for a really long time. I\'d say I went from 1-2 a week to 1 every month or 2 maybe. \n\nHope this gives some people some hope. I was really at the mercy of these damn headaches. But now I\'m moving on to trying to improve my bruxism LOL'"

This has been going on since summer 2021. I was taken to a doctor for neck pain and did x ray finding theater I am having neck spasm. I did physical therapy for a month. The only thing that helped a bit was when this lady there did cupping. Just finished last week. Didnt help much. My parents want to think it is posture, but nothing is helping.I was supposed to do a follow up and if ot hasnt gotten better do an mri. But my parents arent going to do that. Have been taking execedrin for migraines for months and advil and this rarely works at all. This pain is unbearable that I have been having dark though because I cant take the pain. I have tried cefaly, medicine, ice, heat, neck massager. Any ideas please? Could it be occipital neuralgia? Or something else.'"
Tetracycline,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/2cpzdw/starting_my_treatment_today_wish_me_luck/,"b'Starting my treatment today, wish me luck!'",Image365,"b'Hello /r/accutane!\n\nI\'ve had problems with acne for about two years now and it hit a peak last summer, I looked like shit to be honest. It also happened to be during graduation so unfortunately I look like crap in all my graduation photos and I don\'t want to see them because I cringe everytime I see them. In August last year I went to a doctor and she gave me tetracycline. After about a month of tetracycline it did get better, almost ""perfect"". During this time I was also travelling around the world so in february I ran out of pills. My host family in New Zealand managed to get me more pills but only enough for me to take one pill a day instead of two. I continued on one pill a day and things started getting worse. Now the last few months my face has been ok. I mean, it\'s still bad but it\'s better than it was last summer. My back has gotten worse though, a lot worse. It\'s so bad that I can\'t wear white or bright t-shirt, can\'t wear tank tops, can\'t do squats in the gym because it hurts too much putting the bar on my acne-infested shoulders.\n\nA few weeks ago I went to the doctor again and she booked a time for me with a dermatologist. The dermatologist didn\'t even hesitate to put me on Accutane (or Isotretinoin as it is called here now). I took my first three pills (3x20mg) a few hours ago. I haven\'t noticed any side effects yet I think. My eyes are a bit dry but they get dry some late evenings usually and my lips are a little bit dry too but that can happen sometimes as well.\n\nHopefully things will get better now. I\'ll try to take some photos tomorrow of my back so you can see and also so that I can keep track of the progress.\n\nBy the way, I wonder, how bad can the muscle and joint pains be? I mean, I do work out quite a lot (2 hours four-five times a day). Normally I don\'t get very sore the days after, just light/moderate DOMS but will it get unbearable now when being on accutane? Has anybody combined accutane with weight lifting?\n\n**Update 2014-08-10** Five days in now. My knees and elbows have been hurting a bit, especially a few days ago, but it\'s manageable. My muscles aren\'t getting more sore now than before so that\'s good. As for the skin, my face is a little drier but I put moisturizer on my face and body lotion on my back every day so it\'s not bad at all. Haven\'t noticed my lips getting dry yet. The worst side effect is probably my eyes. They are dry, especially in the evenings. I find it hard to stay up for long since my eyes start getting really dry at like eight or nine o clock in the evening. I\'m also feeling a bit tired in general but I don\'t know if it\'s the medicine or something else causing that.\nI haven\'t noticed any improvement at all when it comes to the acne. It has gotten worse, especially in the face. But I\'m patient and I hope that it will turn better soon.\n\n**Update 2014-08-13** A bit more than a week in now. My face is getting incredibly dry and I\'ve had a massive outbreak in my face the last few days. Yesterday I showered at the gym after the workout but I forgot to bring my moisturizer, big mistake! I had to rush home as quick as I can to get hold of some moisturizer to put on my face. I was afraid my whole face would crack if I opened my mouth or smiled or anything. Right now I have to put moisturizer on my face about 10-15 times a day, lip balm just as much. My back is fine with getting lotion only once a day. My face has been really painful yesterday and today, can\'t open my mouth too much, can\'t smile and so on. It\'s been getting a little better the last few hours now so hopefully it\'s even better tomorrow. I had a look in the mirror just now before going to bed and my back is a lot less red than it used to be. The pimples are also less swollen and red, they\'re just small white things now, at least most of them. Something I didn\'t expect was my mood to change. I get sad/angry a lot easier than before and life just feels tough at the moment. I am a little bit nervous as well, moving cities on Saturday, which means I will move in to an apartment with two other people. I wont be able to make the first impression I want to make, but I guess I\'ll just have to explain it to them... Starting university on Tuesday next week, hopefully my face looks a bit better by then, because I wont be able to explain it all to hundreds of people. I just hope nobody will judge me for what I look like at the moment. I hope they understand the pain I\'m suffering and I hope they wont stare at me or ""remind me"" to wash my face more often or some other bullshit.'"

She can have rapid mood swings where she stops making logical sense, then she ends up crying and hitting herself in the head. A couple months back, she made an attempt on her life with headache meds (I believe it was something like acetaminophen), which sent her to the hospital. She passed the hospital off as a sudden heart problem, but I still figured it out. Her boyfriend is extremely reasonable, but his responses to when shes in a bad place can trigger her even more. It seems that this may have been a life long mental health issue, but Im not sure. She has been twice divorced (once to my dad), and has struggled with relationships for as long as I can remember. I spend most of my time at my dads house, due to the custody agreement, and this problem has been mostly hidden until now. She has seen therapists and is taking medication, but the medication doesnt seem to be working. She usually smokes pot until she passes out. Im worried her boyfriend will move out and she will get worse. My (23M) brother used to live with us and he knew all about her problem, but moved out a couple months ago. She has told me that she wouldnt really take her life because of my brother and I, but Im not sure if I believe her. I dont know what to do, whether to tell my Dad or not, because if I do he may just have me stop coming to her apartment which could push her over the edge. Should get help for her or what?

Before I dive into everything, I just want to say I have been to at least five therapists and have been on anti depressants since I was 16. \n\nFrom 16 to 18 lexapro made me gain 180 pounds (360 pounds after the weight gain) in 1.5 years and after realizing the weight gain, I stopped taking it. I dabbled in eating disorders when I was 17 and ended up being hospitalized from it at age 19. I was diagnosed with  Wernicke's encephalopathy, I couldnt see hear or walk, thats how badly it progressed. I was air lifted to one of the best hospitals on the east coast, and thats where they figured out what was wrong with me. I got extensive questioning about alcohol addiction and many psych neurological evals (major depressive disorder, adjustment disorder) from having this disorder. Neurologist came up with conclusion that it was just from extreme dieting and lack of knowledge. Referred to dietician for a year. Went through some therapists, some moved away, others got promoted to bigger places. Didnt go back cause  it sucked having a cycling door of doctors. \n\nIt took me a year recovery and I suffered from some cognitive impairment (memory loss - short and long term, and poor concentration). I was in physical and occupational therapy for a year before I could return back to college. \n\nFrom there I lost 160 pounds from said eating disorder, and I thought that I could finally be happy.  I started nursing school, actually partaking in Nursing I through IV, struggling throughout but made it through. Just graduated in December with a 3.0 (pre brain disorder I had a 3.9). I thought graduating would make me happy, Im still not happy. The stress of school made me gain 30 pounds, which put me in a very depressive state. \n\nIm on Vyvanse, Wellbutrin and I take Slimquick. I got my Wellbutrin boosted, Vyvanse boosted. Im getting bad pains in my joints, but for the last month Ive lost 15 pounds in about 20 days. I eat small portions. I use my fitness pal religiously, tracking everything I eat. I go to the gym for two hours a day. But lately Ive been getting very bad joint pain. I told my doctor, got a script for phentermine another diet pill. That got flagged at the pharmacy for EXTREME cardiology risks with the Vyvanse. \n\nIve become obsessed with weight loss, thats all I think about. I weigh myself twice a day and monitor it. Im trying to become an RN but Im just feel like Im not going to pass the exam. Ive been doing thousands of practice questions a day and its been very discouraging. Ive tried opening up to one of my professors in the past and she just recommended me for the school counselor. Says all the stress of the program really got to me, and I need to talk to someone about it. \n\nMy teeth are fucked up from bulimia from age 17 to 18. Im too scared to go to a dentist. \n\nHow do I get my life back on track? \n\nIm not suicidal, I just feel trapped.  \n\n\nEdit: advice should be the name, stupid iPhone. """

I want to share with you my story, maybe someone can relate or give me some advice. \n\nIm a 26 year old guy and recently I struggle with the aftermath of a very long manic episode and on top of that severe depression.\n\nSo, before I go into detail what happened I want to share how it got this far, because there was a buildup and in the beginning the illness wasnt as severe as in the end. \n\nWhen I was in school, even though I was fairly popular, had friends, girlfriend and everything I used to be quite depressed over long stretches of time and also socially anxious, but still in a moderate way. I hated lunchbreaks and having to deal with certain people, hated classes where I had to sit adjacent to the bullies and jerks and was also afraid that people would make fun of me. Despite all of this I got through school just fine, never was bullied and also my grades where pretty good when I finished high school.\n\nWhen I was around 15 I started to develop intrusive thoughts which would bother me more and more. In the beginning it was still manageable but as time progressed it became pretty unbearable. \n\nAfter I graduated, I wanted to go to Argentina on my own and that was when I had my first breakdown because the intrusive thoughts became so bad and I was so utterly ashamed of them. So after only two weeks I flew back home, and my mother sent me to a mental hospital where I first confessed these thoughts to anybody. It was only a short stint there because my father took me from there and I lived at his place for a while. During and after the stay I was severely depressed for the first time like this, staying in bed most of the time, being socially awkward and withdrawn. This would soon become a pattern but more on that later. I miraculously recovered a bit (even though the thoughts where still there) and managed to get a job as a pizza delivery driver. After being awkward in the beginning I loosened up and working turned out to be fun. So, I worked there for the summer and got better and better. My confidence started to rise again, I worked on my car, talked to girls again and applied for university. I got accepted but some weeks before classes started, my friend and I had the terrible idea to each sleep with a prostitute. In the beginning it wasnt quite a big deal but after a few days I started to be so ashamed again and felt so guilty and just plainly disgusted by myself. I became depressed again. So, in my case my depression is always accompanied with social anxiety and just becoming super weird and uncomfortable around people. So, when University started I barely made friends and just felt very uncomfortable on campus and so on, whereas if I would have started with the mood I was in before the encounter with the prostitute I probably would have been comfortable around people, because in hindsight I was already low key hypomanic at the time I think.\n\nSo anyways, I got better again but when I realized I had no social connections in University whatsoever I became severely depressed again, just stayed inside in bed all day every day and lived like a hermit again, as is said, a pattern.\n\nI applied for another course which this time I was very passionate about. In the weeks before courses started my mood began to rise again, but this time more heightened than the last time. I started to party all the time, being on the road all the time, trying to meet as many girls as possible, smoking weed whenever I could, dressing better and so on. I just wanted it to be a big adventure and I enjoyed talking to people (also strangers) and had no care in the world. So this time when University started I was still in this heightened mood and talked with everybody (even though Im now ashamed of that because I was very uninhibited and lost the feeling of what was normal and what wasnt so I think I came of as weird with all my talking and also the subjects I talked about, weed, sex, partying) but at least I wasnt the shell of a person I am when Im depressed and was able to talk to people.\n\nSo I made friends there and managed to scrape by my first semester but failed one class.\n\nStupid as that may sound, that triggered another depressive episode where I also began to hate my behavior from the weeks before because I now saw what a monkey I had been. Again, the depression became so bad that my mother sent me to the mental hospital and I moved to my grandparents. I had a sick leave from university and was in deep depression mode for six months before I went back to university.\n\nI moved in with a drug dealer and started to smoke weed daily. Then there was a trip to my Girlfriend who lived in another country. i would say I was in neutral mode when I visited her.\n\nI had done MDMA before and wanted to give it a try with her and what can I say.. we had one of the best nights of my live. Afterwards I just wouldnt sleep, just binging on energy drinks and cigarettes. I began to think MDMA was some sort of magic cure for trauma and everything else, started to google all day long and was so euphoric all the days after the trip. I finally became convinced that MDMA was the pathway to world peace. I really believed that. I had a horrible comedown with huge depression, but it only lasted one afternoon, several days after we had the trip. After that my mania became more and more intense, I started to buy presents for everybody even though there were no birthdays and started to become more and more weird. Then, something happened and suddenly the go happy go lucky mentality changed into pure aggression against my father which at this point I hadnt seen for two years. I drove back to the drug hole, which was the apartment of the dealer I was living with and stole his cocaine, shaved my head and let some homeless Asian kid who I picked up at McDonalds live at my place. I proceeded to threaten a guy who was driving around the block in his car too fast for my taste with some scissors and police came but I just had hidden the scissors and stared them in the eye and said I hadnt done and the police let me go. The other guy even though at the beginning being very aggressive in the end was scared as hell and nearly shaking because I was acting like a goddamn psycho. Mind that, I had never ever been aggressive before, never been in fights, nothing.\n\nSo when I finally stated and believed (after walking aimlessly through the city for hours) I could control the wind and said theoretically, if you jump out the window you can fly my mother called the cops. They seized 10k in cash from the drug dealer I was living with (I am sorry to this day) and took me to the mental hospital, this time for an involuntary stay. \n\nI was very pissed off at my mother and felt betrayed even though in hindsight I understand her decision. Who would have known what would have happened if would have proceeded to rage around in that state of mind? In the hospital I was still super manic, scribbling in my notebook all the time. (to this day I have finished around 8 manic notebooks). I was still super talkative and even made friends there, just everything seemed important and it was all like a movie, even inside the locked up facility. After six weeks they let me go and I moved back to my grandparents and when I realized what I had done and that I completely lost track of my university studies I became depressed again, this time pretty severe with first real thoughts of suicide, hugging my girlfriend thinking to never see her again. I entered complete hermit mode, sleeping until 7 pm and being awake only in the night. \n\nThats when covid hit. And to be honest, it saved me because I could exist in this withdrawn manner and it would be ok. For the first time I managed to pass all my classes in university (online) and started to come out of my hole again when spring came around. I moved back in with my mother and had a short period of normalcy before shit began to hit the fan again. It started with things like speaking an the phone very loud at midnight so that even the neighbors complained. I would always pick fights verbally and have endless discussions over things with my mother so at one point she just wanted me to move out. So thats when things really went south.\n\nI got my apartment in the city and at first I was super happy. It was a cozy place and I decorated everything to my liking. But my Mania was now able to spin freely, not supervised by anybody. Its hard for me to recall everything correctly but it started with a horrible horrible split from my girlfriend because I wanted to do drugs and have her join me (I feel terrible and toxic and just like shit because of that) and she, the good person she is couldnt do it any longer. I dont know when this took place but I insulted her pretty badly over Instagram and there is hardly one day I dont think about that now, it torments me because she really is a nice person and deserved none of the hell ive put her trough. So in a way im glad shes away from me now and can lead a happy healthy live. I started to insult other people too (via whatsapp), at the time thinking in my twisted mind it was some sort of experiment. Thats also the reason why the majority of my old friend doesnt want to have anything to do with me anymore. \n\nAfter that I borrowed a car from a dude I got to know in one of the mental health clinics while he was completely drunk on the couch of his apartment. I just thought I would take it for a ride. It ended in me crashing the car through a fence and then taking a lipstick out the car to dress like the joker and thats when the police got me and sent me to the mental hospital again, involuntary stay again. Its all so fucked up writing this.\n\nSo another manic hospital stay, meeting all sorts of people and in my manic state having the time of my life. Its funny because now it would seem like a horrible place to stay but while manic everything is awesome. Fell in love while being there (manic) had sex while in there (manic) played ping pong until exhaustion and filled another notebook. \n\nAfter six weeks they let me go again.  \n\n\nSo back home, still manic, I try to get a job as a barkeeper, get kicked out because I got drunk at work. I hookup with a girl whom I got to know at the clinic and we go for a wild romance. Met another guy who was the epitome of a Rockstar for me at a parking lot and because his nostrils were completely white we got into a conversation and I end up at his band room doing 3 tabs of acid. I ended up having a fourteen-hour trip where I thought life was just a videogame and I started to smash things and put a drumstick through one of his drums. He soon would become fed up with me, understandably. \n\nLots of other stuff took place but its very hard for me to recall all of it. It also had its upsides because I felt so confident. Talking to woman was possible and I had 2 short but super intense relationships, one with the clinic-girl and one with a 38 year old woman who was super hot and a singer for electronic music so she took me with her to bars and a rave and it was just awesome.   \n\n\nNow to the last part where it all completely spiraled out of control and took a sad ending.   \nI got more and more confused and startet to threaten my mother in long mails and then I went to the mental hospital and admitted myself. Three days in I had enough, went out, bought a bottle of whisky and drank in in one shot. I then went back to my apartment and thats where shit hit the fan. I met a friend there, we chat and because he has trash to bring to the trash room we go there and next I find myself taking my lighter and lighting some paper in the paper container. Next thing I know the whole thing burns, my friend calls the fire fighters, police comes and they send me to a cell. In there im still completely crazy shouting like a ninja and everything. I soon become convinced its a conspiracy and police is gonna come and shoot me so I get really scared. At the end I think they infuse my cell with morphine and all sorts of other delusions. \n\nSo they sent me to high security mental health prison of sorts and still there my mania is in full bloom. It took weeks until I got off the mania and since then life is pure hell. When I started to realize what I had done I spiraled into a depression which I had never before known existed. At some point I got convinced that suicide is the only way out of this hell. \n\n8 months pass and the let me out on parole. No drugs, no alcohol, weekly check in at the doctors. I am now on lithium and abilify.  \n\n\nI am now living in a group home for people with mental health problems. Its just a normal single room and you get to have one talk per week.  \n\n\nHonestly, its been more than a year since the incident and Im just a shell of a person. I came to the conclusion that the only logical answer to my situation would be suicide but I dont act on it because deep down I still want to live and I dont want to do that to my parents (who gladly forgive me for what ive said and done during mania).  \nI dont have a job and Im absolutely terrified of having one.   \nI sleep 14 hours a day if I can and every day is the same, just watching youtube videos.  \nI am so deeply ashamed of what I have done to the point of being afraid of walking into people who might know me.   \nI feel like my personality which I once used to have is gone and left is a blank stare, a blank mind. My past where I used to talk for hours with friends or even strangers seems like a lifetime ago.  \nI guess its just classical depression but it really is pure hell and I understand why people kill themselves, its horror, a nightmare.  \n\n\nSo for everyone who got this far, thank you for reading.   \nMaybe someone can relate or give me advice. (I go to therapy, I take my meds)  \n\n\nThank you people of reddit'"

I was originally diagnosed with ADD in high school and prescribed Adderall XR 30mgs. I was on it the last couple years of high school and lost a tremendous amount of weight. In all honesty I'm not sure if the medication worked or not because I can't remember high school at all. Memory is a huge issue with me partly due to the ADD and partly due to the Adderall. Anyways I just stopped taking Adderall when I was 18 and that was that. \n\nWell in the last year I had really started to notice that I couldn't stay on task. I have absolutely no energy, I can't for the life of me find motivation or will power to do anything other than sleep, watch tv, sit around, and worry about all the things in the world I have no control over. I do not suffer from depression in the slightest. Probably one of the happiest and positive people I know. I started a job I absolutely love as an insurance agent and I am so good at it. Unfortunately I was having a hard time staying on task or finding the motivation to talk to clients or do anything at all other than surf the internet my memory had gotten so bad I couldn't even remember things that happened or conversations from moments before. I went in and had substantial testing done. MRI, CT scans, and a Minnesota personality test. Here is where I was once again diagnosed with ADD and mild anxiety disorder. The doctor explained to me that I was unable to make new memories because I was basically constantly distracted. \n\nHere is where they started me on the Adderall instant release \\(Last November\\). It worked beautifully at first. I had so much energy and motivation. I thought I could rule the world. Then after a couple of months that all went away and I became a literally zombie. I had no personality \\(I'm normally a very personable person\\) and my job got so hard to me. I couldn't hold conversations with clients. I couldn't build a rapport. \n\nAfter several dosage adjustments me and my doctor just decided that Adderall wasn't for me. At this point my doctor gave me Vyvanse 40mg. \n\nLet me tell you how much I love the Vyvanse. I have energy. I'm not a zombie, I tend to stay on task longer. However every single day exactly 7 hours after I would take my meds I would get an insane headache. This was the only side effect but it was nearly unbearable. \n\nI went in 2 weeks ago and talked to my doctor and he ended up prescribing me Wellbutrin SR 150mg twice a day and celebrex for the headaches. So far I am absolutely loving this combination but I am kinda crashing around 2 everyday. \n\nI guess my question is have any of you been in a similar situation with meds. What is the best time of day and spacing for taking these 2 meds so they are working at their maximum potential? I have tried to call and talk to my doctor but he isn't easy to get on the phone. I've read that some people take the Vyvanse and their first does of daily wellbutrin at the same time in the morning. I've read some people take the wellbutrin first in the morning and take the Vyvanse later in that day. I've also read that some take the vyvanse then wait until it is working at its max to take the wellbutrin. I've never had to take 2 meds like this so I'm really just not sure. \n\nTLDR: What is the best times and spacing to take Vyvanse and Wellbutrin SR to maximize its effectiveness?"""

My APRN changed my medication off of Lamotrigine because I developed the skin rash. Gabapentin wasn't terribly effectively for me so I have now been put on an antipsychotic as opposed to an anticonvulsant. I'm not sure what to expect out of the medication shift. There's going to be just a few days between when I get off of Gabapentin and start Latuda. I read that Gabapentin can be detected in your system around 3-4 days after you cease taking it, and I also read on WebMD that it is not recommended for Gabapentin and Latuda to be taken together. Furthermore, I noticed that Latuda could cause a decrease in white blood cells, this caught my attention because I am also anemic and have some mild concerns here as well. I'm waiting to get an appointment for blood work as of today. Sorry for the longish read but anything I should be concerned with? I have researched what I can but I'd like to hear if anyone has dealt with these. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks!"""

Currently, I am taking 60 mg  of dexilant, a proton pump inhibitor, once daily for suspected GERD. In addition, I take Trazodone 100 mg for insomnia. I do not drink, smoke, or use recreational drugs. I have a separate diagnosis of persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD). \n\nIn 2020, I underwent a endoscopy for swallowing issues. The GI doctor concluded that the everything was normal. However, he did suggest that I had a unusual amount of postnasal drip, and he stated that my post nasal drip could be causing the swallowing issues. I was referred to a allergist who found conclusive evidence of environmental allergies and allergies to salmon, tomatoes, and peanuts. I have since cut out the offending food allergies to no avail. I was placed on Prevacid, but it did not improve my symptoms. I find it hard to swallow certain foods, particularly tough meats. When I swallow, it feels like food is getting stuck in my chest or throat. My issues swallowing have gotten progressively worse over time. I am now on mostly a liquid diet. My GP does not want to order another endoscopy. I am really struggling and would like some direction with this. \n\nRecently, in the past couple of months, I have developed persistent nasal congestion and breathing issues.

However, I have so many negative test results, it makes me feel like I have Factitious Disorder. I recognize I also have psychiatric issues though, which may have physical manifestations. \n* OSA: This has been my personal working diagnosis for a long time. I can become partially obstructed without even falling asleep all the way. I didn\'t fall asleep at the home sleep study, but I also didn\'t have obstructive symptoms at the 2 hospital sleep studies. I can\'t be prescribed a CPAP without an official diagnosis. \n* Venous Insufficiency: one vein bulging out, but placing legs to ceiling REALLY helps.

It was so bad one time she got admitted into hospital and they thought she had a stroke, but all her tests were normal except her blood pressure was a bit low. \n\nShes seen multiple GPs but none of them seem very helpful and they are all very dismissive. Shes now finally been referred to an ENT to check for Mnires disease, after one of the drs at the emergency department suggested it might be this, but Im worried theyre not gonna find anything and well be back at square one. I feel so bad for her as its affected her life immensely, shes not able to work anymore and the episodes keep happening more frequently. \n\nWe have talked about her potentially going to a private clinic, so I guess thats the next step if nothing comes out of seeing the ENT. \n\nI just wanted to see if I could get any useful advice here, what can we do for her? Who should she see? Any suggestions on what it could possibly be? Would appreciate anything at this point as were not getting much help from the public health care system where we live."""

My skin wasnt bad enough to cause a problem in my social life around a month and a half ago and Id happily take a full up close face pic for Snapchat or whatever else. But I started working contracting as a summer job and with it found myself eating at whatever restaurant wed choose, one day itd be Bucees brisket and a large coke from the soda fountain, next its dominos with McDonalds for breakfast, etc but overall my skin was fine. I began a ketogenic diet eating only vegetables to try to clear my skin, drinking green tea each morning and night and three gallons of water each day. Two weeks after indulging on junk from contracting I still had to little to no acne from the job but a month into the ketogenic diet I found horrible breakouts much like the ones I had on my bulk for the gym a year ago. All on my jaw I had 7-8 major dime sized pimples and found myself sulking inside my house and for the first time in my life depressed shutting friends out and shutting down. I began to listen to different podcasts and used Reddit for the first time in six years hence the weird username, and found that with eating on keto I was eating more food to try and get the same filling affect as junk food. And o e thing about food is it all turns into gluclose/sugar during glycolysis and lypolisis so, you cant escape sugar you can only escape added and refined sugars. This sped my skin into a horrible a down fall and slowly pulled myself into an intermittent fast that timed the times I ate around certain times per day basically getting rid of the inbetween snacking, I began taking 15 B5 capsules a day and this along with zinc, vitamin A, folate, berberine, and NAC began to heal my skin. Two and a half weeks later and Im happy to walk out the door and get back into my happy and busy life Ive been apart of with clearer skin than before the breakout.  \n\nSometimes, the acne has to do with the times you eat, not so much the food, stop snacking and eat on a schedule its like playing with yourself if you do it without the urge you got a problem if you eat without being hungry it may just cause a problem with your skin, sleep good, and take large amounts of Pantothenic Acid (B5) (around 15 capsules a day) Zinc (around 5 capsules a day) and Vitamin A (around 5 capsules a day)'"

I've been on ambien almost nightly for several years and while it certainly takes care of my insomnia, it has the lovely side effects of daytime fatigue and brain fog. For the longest time I thought I'd just have to accept it and try to push on with life after my last Pdoc basically said to just eat right and exercise, which was certainly good advice in general, but didn't really help my ambien issues. Also recently did a full blood workup which should no issues. So, I finally got off my butt and started digging deep into  how brain fog works and ambien mechanisms along with my depression/anxiety med Effexor.\n\nFrom what my layman mind can gather, brain fog is usually caused by neurotransmitter imbalance. The chief ones being Serotonin, Dopamine, GABA and Acetylcholine. These imbalances often coincide with depression/anxiety. Ambien seems to work by binding to GABA receptors which then release inhibitory neurons which then inhibit other inhibitory neurons for things like dopamine. I barely understand that sentence myself, but I was wondering if any one with knowledge of pharmacology knew if ambien causes neurotransmitter imbalance (too much or too little). My hope is that by finding out where the imbalance is, I could reduce brain fog by correcting the imbalance via supplement, diet or meds.\n\nAny knowledge would be greatly appreciated!"""

morphine,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/hcpsez/epipen_injection_site_severe_pain_does_anyone/,b'Epipen injection site (SEVERE PAIN) (DOES ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCE THIS??)',,"b'\nHey yall, I am 18(F) who has always had medical issues throughout my whole life that have been very weird, rare, and sometimes baffling for someone my age. Im not a pussy, dont get me wrong, Ive been in fights before in middle school, have dealt with ostioid ostioma (benign tumor on my T3 spine including surgery), ostiomiolitis (infection to the jaw caused from botched wisdom tooth surgery along with 2 jaw breaks, and 3 surgeries total for that wisdom teeth removal ordeal.) I have experienced severe pain many times, controlled with prescribed pain killers. \n\n(About the subject at hand of epipen injection pain)\n\nI have dealt with anaphylaxis my whole life, I started having severe reactions to coconut, pineapple, and palm kernel oil a few years ago that required hospital visits frequently, to the point where we dont go to the hospital anymore (due to the fact my mom is a doctor, she monitors me at home and Im always fine) BUT.. for some fucking reason that no doctor has been able to answer, I get SEVERE. And I mean severe pain from epipen injections. To the point where Im crying uncontrollably for 30-48 hours straight unless Ive had pain killers. Let me state this. I am NOT a drug seeker, I have had opioids in the past and have dealt with the horrific withdrawals and effects its caused to me. If anything, I wish I could never take them, but I sincerely cannot go without pain medicine without suffering when I use an epipen. I am completely fine with needles, I can get shots, ivs, etc and not wince. Yet an epipen needle causes me to scream in agony for any relief, I cant even walk for at least a day and a half. Ive tried heat, cold, lidocaine, Advil/ naproxen, Tylenol, even whiskey, (whiskey helps, none of the others do) \n\nSo I have a few questions, since pain killers arent easy to get/ I dont want to drink every time I have anaphylaxis.\n\nIve also tried injecting on different parts of my body, I dont hit nerves, still pain, so I stick to the thigh. \n\n1. Does anybody else have this problem??? If so, how do you handle it and have you found any remedies to fix this issue?\n\n2. Like I said, Im no pussy, Ive dealt with pain, is there any reason WHY this happens to me and very very few people (this is extremely rare, I only found one forum with one comment of someone saying their sister gets severe pain) \n\nAdded note: something else that happens to me when I use an epipen \n\n5/10 times (10/10 when I take a beta blocker) my heart rate drops to 20/25bpm, has gone as low as 17, my blood pressure shoots from high to low consistency causing me to feel dizzy and like I had an injection of morphine (the head rush) and my heart rate will skip beats, I know this can happen as a side effect, but why so often? Does this have anything to do with the pain? None of my doctors know any answers on this, so I thought I may as well ask the internet. Ive been accused of being a hypochondriac (somebody who has fear/ exaggerates pain) since 2018, when I had my back tumor. (It originally didnt show up on x rays, 7 month diagnose delay and the cat scan& mri showed it finally.) (wisdom tooth removal my oral surgeon was a terrible person, he saw my face swollen up to the point it looked like I weighed 200 pounds, and didnt get any films even after my 7th visit, so thats on him) but anyway, you can see why I would ask anybody else besides a doctor. My mom is a breast cancer surgeon so even though shes a doctor, this obviously isnt her specialty) , please, does anyone have an answer?'"

Common trends.',,"b'No hate I swear and not targeted at any individual at all but come on guys, some people here are just showing themselves up. \n\nPeople are absolutely testing the limits of the age old phrase of theres no such thing as a stupid question. \n\nWanting to start a thread of those oh so common things that people continue to post and ask about, in the hopes that people read first rather than repeatedly ask the same questions. \n\nAs a side note though, hope everyones journey isnt being too brutal and that we all will be out the other side of this asap. \n\nIll go first though:\n\n- Yes, taking Accutane is likely to make your skin worse at first. This is normal. It doesnt happen to everyone. It might happen for shorter or longer periods of time. Theres nothing to predict how long your purge will last. You may find that you purge in places that you didnt previously have acne. Again normal. \n\n- You arent going to die if you drink alcohol. And no, the medicine will continue to work. You should of course try and restrict how much you drink as Accutane can affect peoples liver. Just use your brain. If you have an absolute bender one night, thats okay. Drink some water and move on. You will survive. \n\n- Im taking 5mg once a month (not literally). Yeah its probably not going to work wonders. Although there is often method in the madness, talk to your Derm about what their long term plan is for you and dont bother asking on here. \n\n- Yes that rash on your hand is probably from Accutane. Get some moisturiser on it and crack on. \n\n- Ive been taking Accutane for a week and Ive still got spots. Of course you do. Your skin cycle is at least a month normally (although this is being sped up by taking Accutane) so you are very unlikely to experience immediate results. Some people do see changes quickly, others take half a year before they even see any changes. Again, it all relative. Keep going or dont, its up to you. \n\n- I weigh three stone and Im on 200mg per day, is this too much. Aye yeah of course it is.  Youre going to end up like a raisin Im sure. Probably worth talking to your Derm. \n\n- Yes, dry lips are normal and are to be expected. Stick some aquaphor on and move on. If that doesnt work for you try something else. \n\n- Ive just spent three hours on a sun bed trying to go brown for my hols, should I be worried? Yes of course you should. You are so much more likely to burn than you would have been before taking Accutane. Why are you spending all this time and effort trying to fix your skin and then actively trying to damage it a different way? Seems counterintuitive. Have a summer off. \n\nWhat have I missed? \n\nAgain, its all in jest but come on guys. '"

I had asked him previously what I should expect from them and he said youll know it when you feel it.\n\nI also found my heart rate rising, which the manufacturer listed as a side effect that IMMEDIATELY warranted stopping the medication. I had insomnia which many online had said is a sign of amphetamine addiction/someone who doesnt have ADHD will experience.\n\nI called my psych about it who immediately called me in to check my heart.

influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/89oava/autism_tropes_long_read/,b'Autism Tropes (long read)',,"b'I wrote a blog post a while back, attempting to explain/debunk 23 common autism tropes that I\'ve encountered. I\'d like to know if anyone else can relate to my thoughts, or if I\'m alone in these conceptions. Also, feel free to correct spelling and grammar if that\'s your thing. Please note that everything below is based on my personal perspective as an aspie, and that I\'m not attempting to speak for everyone.\n\n*""Autistic people don\'t feel empathy.""*\n\n*I don\'t understand what makes you feel that way...*\n\nFor many people on the autism spectrum there is a partial disconnect between emotions and body language. Many can feel overwhelming joy, paralysing fear, and debilitating sorrow - to name a few - with a blank expression. I think this is the origin of the misconception.\n\nIt\'s also common for us on the spectrum to have trouble conveying our feelings, in part because of the above-mentioned disconnection. And since many of us have impeded social intuition and struggle to understand social conventions, it can make for a compartmentalised response; what I recognise I empathise with to the point of losing touch with myself, and what I don\'t recognise I\'m completely unaware of.\n\n*""Autistic people are rude and antisocial.""*\n\n*I guess that means we have something in common.*\n\nWhen you\'re stressed out, you tend to get grumpy, bitter, rude, and a bit antisocial. Imagine having a stress threshold about 1/100 of your normal threshold, and then imagine everything that stresses you is 10 times more stressful, and add all unplanned events and unexpected circumstances to the list of things that stress you out. Welcome to my world.\n\n*""Autistic people can\'t improvise.""*\n\n*I\'m afraid I don\'t have an answer prepared for that.*\n\nEvery time someone talks to me I\'m improvising. Social life is one long improvisation act. And I\'m not bad at it; I just suck at improvising under pressure, and I quickly run out of steam if I have to improvise a lot. It seems to me most people improvise automatically by observing a situation, getting a feel of it, and then acting on their intuition. My intuitive responses to most social situations has proven untrustworthy, so instead of relying on automatic reactions I have to consciously consider every little detail, and that takes both time and effort. That\'s why I like to plan ahead, and opt out of improvisation if possible.\n\nI actually find that I\'m better at improvising under certain conditions than many of my allistic counterparts. Since I\'m used to always consciously dealing with the majority of my daily life, when something out of the ordinary happens and many allistic people have no intuition to go on, I\'m oftentimes the first to take appropriate action (e.g. if the fire alarm goes off it\'s really no more stressful or confusing to me than, for instance, out of the blue being asked why I look angry).\n\n*""Autistic people don\'t get small talk.""*\n\n*Let\'s go back to talking about the weather...*\n\nAfter long and careful analysis I\'ve come to the conclusion that small talk serves as a stepping stone to actual conversation. Thing is, I never needed a stepping stone; I\'m perfectly fine with jumping right in. Also, this stepping stone leads in multiple directions, and a lot of uncertain options is a recipe for disaster for many on the spectrum. We\'d rather just talk about the things we want to talk about instead of beating around the bush. I feel like, while many of us on the spectrum don\'t really get small talk, most not on the spectrum are overly dependent on it.\n\n*""Autistic people can\'t think outside the box.""*\n\n*Unlike you? Could you look up \'hypocrisy\' for me?*\n\nI have to think outside the box every time I\'m presented with a situation I\'m not prepared for, and that happens several times on a good day. You just don\'t notice most of the time, because it doesn\'t occur to you that it might be a problem. So when you present me with a specific box that you already know how to think outside of, sure, it may seem like I have trouble thinking outside the box. But I\'m already juggling a dozen unfamiliar boxes here, so I think I\'m doing a decent job.\n\n*""Autistic people are boring loners who don\'t like to party.""*\n\n*Maybe not with you...*\n\nImagine Skrillex being blasted in your ears while you\'re trying to have a conversation. That\'s pretty much how parties feel to me. I need a calm, predictive environment to navigate, and the amount of sensory chaos at an average party is impossible for me to deal with. It\'s like a war zone to me. So no, when partying means going out clubbing, or to a bar, etc., I don\'t like to party. But if the party is, instead, a small group watching a movie, sharing a hobby together, etc., I\'m happy to party. It\'s all about perspectives. Most of us who are loners are only so due to a lack of a better alternative.\n\n*""Autistic people are always socially awkward.""*\n\n*It\'s kind of tricky to not feel awkward when presented with such ridiculous, stereotypic claims.*\n\nYou\'d be awkward too if you were used to being bashed for not fitting in, and knowing you could get bashed again any time for something you aren\'t aware you\'re doing wrong. It\'s like going through life getting punished for being you, for breaking arbitrary rules you can\'t wrap your head around. Humans are as adults a product of their childhood, and the odd one out in school is an easy target. Growing up being the target can make you kind of jumpy.\n\nAlso, when you know the world around you expects you to be awkward, it can be tricky to not feel awkward about it. I imagine it\'s comparable to being the one white person in a group of black people, who gets awkward because (s)he has to make absolutely sure nothing (s)he says can be misconstrued as racist.\n\n*""Autistic people can\'t multitask.""*\n\n*This just in: water is wet.*\n\nI\'m always multitasking. It\'s just with tasks that most don\'t consider work. Keeping appropriate eye-contact whilst keeping track of the conversation is enough to be a challenge, and that\'s only the tip of the iceberg. So yeah, adding more tasks on top of that is like throwing an anchor to a drowning person.\n\n*""Autistic people don\'t understand irony, sarcasm, and proverbs.""*\n\n*Don\'t judge a book by the cover, even if it doesn\'t meet your preconceived standards.*\n\nIt\'s a common trait for people on the autism spectrum to struggle with abstract speech, but the vast majority I\'ve known have had no problem with it. In fact, among people with *Asperger\'s Syndrome, you can expect thick, oozing sarcasm and intense irony. And puns; so many puns it\'s not even punny #seewhatididthere #haha #okayillstop\n\n*""You don\'t look autistic.""*\n\n*Thanks, you too.*\n\nI guess I could choose to interpret this as an insult, like, ""You don\'t fit my debilitating preconceptions of autism; explain yourself!"" but I\'d really rather not. Most of us don\'t fit the TV stereotypes, and Rainman is based on a man with Savant syndrome, not on your average run-of-the-mill autistic person. Movies and series need to entertain or tell a story, so producers will focus on traits that fit the setting, whilst most of the characteristics of autism are about as entertaining as watching paint dry.\nAs an afterthought, I wonder what we\'re supposed to look like?\n\n*""What\'s your special ability?""*\n\n*I can travel forwards in time at a speed of one second pr. second.*\n\nAutism is not savantism, although the two aren\'t mutually exclusive. Many autistic people are really good at a handful of things, but usually not to the degree of a savant, so it rarely qualifies as a ""special ability"". We do, however, tend to have special interests that mean the world to us, and so we know a lot about them. But that doesn\'t go for all of us.\n\n*""Autistic people are good at math.""*\n\n*I\'d say one half is, one half isn\'t, and the last half is somewhere in between.*\n\nSome of us are, sure. But then, some allistic people are really good at math. I guess numbers do appeal to a lot of autistic people, being as concrete and certain as they are, but I flunked my math exam.\n\n*""Everyone is a little autistic.""*\n\n*What do you want me to do with that information?*\n\nTechnically yes, but not to the degree that makes it a disability. Like, most people brush their teeth in the same pattern every day, but that doesn\'t really count as autism. You only get the diagnosis when it\'s a significant disadvantage in your everyday life. It\'s called a disability for a reason.\n\n*""Autistic people could be normal if they tried.""*\n\n*Yeah, well, so could you.*\n\nThis one is especially difficult to deal with, because how do you say anything to that? I\'m autistic; I don\'t even understand what your concept of normality is. It\'s easy to do, of course, when it comes naturally to you - like it does to most - but for us on the spectrum, we simply don\'t have the same degree of social intuition; we have to consciously process everything. Have you ever tried thinking about how you put on your pants and then suddenly fumbled and lost your balance? That\'s how social life is to me, except if I choose to not think about it, I come off as cold, uncaring, and uninterested; which I\'m not.\n\nAlso, most of us on the spectrum easily get overstimulated and confused, and that\'s not really something one can just will away. And neither is a low threshold for stress.\n\n*""How would you describe autism.""*\n\n*I\'d rather not, really...*\n\nTo me, personally, it\'s the ability to find the needle and miss the haystack.\n\n*""What\'s it like to be autistic?""*\n\n*What\'s it like to not be autistic?*\n\nImagine having to consciously consider and adapt to everything you would normally do automatically. For most on the spectrum that holds true to a degree, but as it\'s a spectrum, some struggle more than others.\n\nI can\'t speak for everyone. I have Asperger\'s Syndrome and am fortunate to be fairly bright; my main areas of concern are social interaction, a low threshold for stress, and trouble processing too much information at the same time. Here\'s a rough idea of why in an average conversation:\nI have to focus on the conversation, listen actively, consciously process what I\'m hearing to make sure I don\'t misunderstand the ""normal"" way of expressing yourself, phrase responses so that I think they will be perceived as I intend (which is usually not as I intuitively think), carefully interpret facial expressions and body language, keep appropriate eye-contact, intentionally adapt my own facial expression and body language, keep an eye out for miscommunications that need to be addressed right away, and remain painfully aware of my surroundings so that I won\'t be caught off guard by something I\'m expected to be able to handle. Allistic people allegedly do all these things intuitively; I have to consciously juggle all these tasks simultaneously, whilst being judged by the same standards as those who don\'t.\n\n*""What is the best thing about being autistic.""*\n\n*I don\'t really keep a list.*\n\nI guess I\'d say awareness; there are so many things I\'m aware of as a consequence of my autism that most people seem to have no clue about, which is kind of like being able to see a world that is hidden from most. But it\'s equal parts enlightening and isolating.\n\n*""If you could be cured, would you?""*\n\n*Whats there to cure? ~Charles Bromley, Daybreakers*\n\nAutism is a neuro-developmental condition; not an illness. It isn\'t amenable to any form of tablet treatment and can\'t be cured; only repaired. And I probably don\'t have to explain why attempting to physically repair your brain is a bad idea.\n\nWe (humans) are the lives we experience; we (autistics) have never experienced anything else. So basically you\'re asking, ""If you could have your personality and the entire basis for your identity arbitrarily altered to fit a, to you, foreign conception of existence that I perceive as better, would you?"" And to that the answer is no.\n\nThe thing is, everyone I\'ve ever known on the spectrum (and I\'ve known a fair few) saw their autism as part of their identity, and not as a disability. Many, myself included, even take offence at well-meant sympathy. Autism is often more of a problem to allistic people, and through their problems it becomes a problem to us. We\'re told we\'re rigid and can\'t adapt, but really I find it\'s mostly ""normal"" people who can\'t deal with us being a bit odd and can\'t/won\'t adapt their social norms to leave room for us being different.\n\nIt\'s possible to change society to make room for autistics; it\'s not possible to change autistics to fit into current society. So maybe we should be asking this question instead: ""If you could help change society to become more flexible, so that people on the autism spectrum could better lead a productive life on par with the rest of the population, would you?""\n\n*""Autism is caused by vaccines.""*\n\n*Needless deaths of children from preventable diseases are caused by ignorant parents who\'d rather their kids get polio than autism.*\n\nAll scientific evidence ever produced (under actually scientific conditions) contradicts the claim that vaccines cause autism, and I for one trust science over scapegoating. But even if it were true, I just don\'t see why you\'d expose your child to the much larger risk of debilitating diseases than the minute risk of getting autism. If I had to redo my life, but had the option to exchange autism with polio, I\'d redo autism any day.\n\n*""Don\'t say you are autistic; say you have it.""*\n\n*I\'ll make my own decisions, thank you very much.*\n\nYou are your mental disabilities as much as you are the rest of your mind. My autism is the basis for my perception of the world, so really, I\'m autistic. It\'s not a flu; I didn\'t catch it somewhere, so I don\'t have it. Besides, ""having autism"" implies you can pass it on, which would make things vastly more interesting, wouldn\'t you say?\n""Who\'s got the autism? Lilly? Alright, make sure to pass it on to Jimmy when you\'re done with it; it\'s his turn next."" #speakingofsarcasm\n\n*""Autistic people tend to be atheist.""*\n\n*Based on what observations? The Internet? Some scientist you are...*\n\nI haven\'t made any surveys, so I can\'t say if this is true. But I do think a lot of people on the spectrum have felt shunned by society, and thus have a deep urge to revolt against authority; and religion is an appealing authority to revolt against, since it has no empirical founding. As for me, all religions I know of just don\'t add up to my perception of reality, so that objectively makes me an atheist, just like proliferating stereotypes objectively makes you prejudiced.\n\n*""Autistic people don\'t like children.""*\n\n*Maybe not your children...*\n\nI like children. A lot. Children are way easier to be around than adults. But speaking of adults, I don\'t like being with children while their parents breathe down my neck because I\'m being ""creepy"". It\'s not creepy to enjoy playing hide and seek at 28; immature, sure, whatever works for you, but stop treating me like a creep!\n\n*""You\'re autistic? You should see Big Bang Theory!""*\n\n*No. No I shouldn\'t.*\n\nI personally find it distasteful how they portray a twisted version of a mental disability as a set of laughable quirks, creating an extremely unrealistic stereotype that I\'m suddenly expected to live up to, because people who watch the show are too unimaginative to fathom that it\'s nothing more than idle entertainment. But hey, maybe that\'s just me.\n\nEDIT: Formatting (I can\'t seem to figure out how to make it more readable than this)'"
acetaminophen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/11k1hrq/diclofenacmedication_questions_and_advice_request/,b'Diclofenac/Medication Questions and Advice Request',,"b""Hi everyone.  I started having sciatica and joint problems in my right side beginning at the end of January. For the first 2-3 weeks I could barely walk (a 2 minute walk to the kitchen turned into 30min+!) but now it's at a tolerable point where I can walk short distances with a cane and do minor physical activities. I'm not sure what caused this. It feels like a mix of stabbing nerve pain, inflammation and aching in my joint. I's not related to my spine (had negative spinal Xrays in January before this) and I'm currently waiting for results on a hip Xray I took last week. I am also scheduled to start physical therapy in the next week. If that doesn't help my doctor is looking towards an MRI. (6 weeks of PT is for the insurance hoops for an MRI.)\n\nI was taking a lot of Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen every day for the first few weeks for the pain. Acetaminophen for the general pain and Ibuprofen for the pain and inflammation I could feel pulsing and stabbing in my side. I ended up developing Edema in my feet, ankles and lower calves from taking too much Ibuprofen (didn't know it could do that to you!) so I stopped the Ibuprofen. After the edema cleared up my doctor put me on Diclofenac DR (75mg x2/day) to help with the pain and inflammation I am getting/feeling around the joint in my right hip/leg. \n\n***My questions are if this is a pretty standard dose of Diclofenac or if this goes any higher, and if this is a medication that can be taken long term as a means of treatment? I was also wanting to see if there were any other recommendations for medications that would help (I'm already on an opioid medication so I'm not asking for opioid-related controlled substances!).*** I know Diclofenac is generally a strong NSAID and I've been told not to take any others (not really trusting Ibuprofen anymore, honestly. lol!).\n\nI'm only on Diclofenac for a few more days as it's temporary until I see my primary doctor on the 15th and would like to have an idea of the plan ahead and discuss this with her. I definitely think it helps, along with the other medication I'm taking (I can tell a difference with and without for comparison), but of course I'm trying to be optimistic and open as I've never experienced anything like this in my life. \n\nAnyway, sorry for somewhat ranting and giving too much extra details and whatnot lol.   \nThank you to anyone who reads and answers and good health to you all!

influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/mlur4a/its_things_like_this_that_make_me_wonder/,"b""It's things like this that make me wonder""",,"b'This is long, sorry. I tried to keep the paragraphs short, and there\'s a tl;dr at the end.\n\nI\'m 35; diagnosed with ADHD about 3 years ago. I also have depression and anxiety. I take an SSRI for depression, but I don\'t take anything for ADHD. Stimulants didn\'t help and made me keep losing weight.\n\nI live alone, but I just spent almost two weeks visiting my parents now that they\'re both fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nBefore the visit, I was a depressed, barely-functional wreck. I was staying up until 3 or 4 am and sleeping most of the day. I was struggling to feed myself. I hadn\'t done laundry in over a month and my kitchen sink had its own ecosystem. I spent most of my waking hours on my phone, engaging in addictive behavior and unhealthy escapism.\n\nI love my parents. They are my two favorite people, and I love spending time with them and in my childhood home. Being around them also helps me keep to a routine of sorts - I still sleep until noon or 1 pm when I\'m there, but I eat regularly (it helps that someone else is feeding me!) and I take a walk with my mom every day. And, of course, I have people who love me to talk to and hug.\n\nI drove back to my apartment yesterday and immediately washed my bedding. I went to bed at 2 am and slept until noon, but then I cleaned my vacuum cleaner filter assembly, walked to my polling place to vote (state election), and picked up groceries on the way back. I also did laundry for the first time in months.\n\nImmediately after getting back from voting, around 4 pm, I felt sleepy (despite getting 10 hours of sleep!) and lay down for a nap. An alert from a group chat on my phone woke me at 7 pm.\n\nThis is a pattern with me. After I visit my parents, I\'m happy and (relatively) productive for a day or two. After that my mental and emotional state gradually decline until I\'m once again wallowing in depression, desperately unhappy and overwhelmed by the mere thought of doing anything to improve my life or my surroundings.\n\nIt\'s stuff like this that makes me wonder whether I really have ADHD or ""just"" chronic burnout. I\'ve been unemployed since last October, and I haven\'t been seriously trying to get another job because I dread it.\n\nMy SSRI prevents the constant anxiety nausea I used to have, but the only thing that *really* helps me is spending time with my parents. But then why do I need a three-hour nap when I\'ve slept for ten hours and only been awake for four?\n\ntl;dr: the single most effective treatment for my depression and inability to function is spending time with my parents, after which I\'m sort of ok for a few days before spiralling back into a maze of depression and paralysis. Don\'t know if I actually have ADHD or if I\'ve just been burned out for the past ten years and counting.'"
effexor,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/13fon53/coronary_artery_disease_at_28_yo/,b'Coronary Artery Disease at 28 y/o?',,"b'Hi there, \n\nI\'m a 28 y/o white female. I\'m 5\'4"" and 120 lbs. I\'m active and eat very well (this will be relevant). I take Effexor XR (Venlafaxine) for OCD (>10 years); Select 1/35 (norethindrone 1 mg and ethinyl estradiol 0.035 mg) for birth control (>10 years); and most recently, Accutane for acne (\\~4 months).   \n\n\nBetween September and December 2022, I unexpectedly lost 30 lbs (140 lbs > 110 lbs) due to no appetite. I attributed this to stress, since my grad school supervisor told me she was dying at the end of August 2022 and died mid-September 2022. During this time, I experienced lightheadedness, weakness, pre-syncope events while working out, and heart palpitations. Again, I attributed to this to stress. I saw my GP anyways, and she sent me for bloodwork to rule out a number of issues (e.g., thyroid) and an ECG. My bloodwork was perfect, except for slightly elevated LDL (which was also true a year prior). My ECG indicated a short PR interval, which my GP wasn\'t too concerned about. She referred me to a cardiologist, anyways. My stress test revealed  a short PR interval and ST depression at my maximum; my holter monitor revealed a short PR interval and significant ST downsloping; and my echo was normal. I\'m now awaiting a CT coronary angiogram w/ calcium score, scheduled for the end of May. In the meantime, my LDL has increasenothing crazy, but it keeps going up. \n\nI\'m here, because I\'d like to know if this looks like CAD?

methadone,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/123z7d9/trying_to_understand_how_my_brother_died_he/,"b'Trying to understand how my brother died - he ""stiffened up"" after being hit? Official cause of death is prescription drug overdose'",,"b'I also cross-posted this to r/RBI but I wanted to see if any doctor had experience with addiction, eating disorders and physical health and could offer insight.\n\nMy brother (24m, 6\'3"", 140lbs, white) was a drug addict, in and out of treatment programs/rehab for almost a decade. This past October, he passed away while in a sober living program after an altercation with his roommate. They fought over a sweatshirt, the roommate hit him, and my brother called my mom crying. She said he sounded incredibly upset and was hyperventilating. He was very sensitive and prone to debilitating panic attacks so this was not unusual - she reassured him that she would head over immediately to go see and comfort him and then they hung up (I\'m unclear on whether he had calmed down at that point or not). A staff member at the program went to go check on him - this staff member said my brother was crying in bed, and then started to stiffen up. The staff member thought my brother was overdosing on opioids so he administered Narcan. My brother passed away shortly thereafter.\n\nHowever, this staff member has given conflicting stories on different occasions. We were originally told my brother began seizing after he got hit, but later, in an official report from the sober living program, the staff member described it as ""stiffening up"" rather than seizing. This official report was conducted at my mother\'s request. Also, the staff member **originally told us he administered Narcan twice, and then in the official report wrote that he administered Narcan only once.** I\'m not sure if that distinction really matters or not, which is why I\'m asking here to see if anyone has knowledge about this.\n\nThe coroner said that **there were no illegal drugs in my brother\'s system** at the time of his death, so the Narcan would not have helped anyway. Google says that Narcan does not harm you if there are no drugs in your system, so I\'m assuming that it didn\'t cause his death.\n\nThe official cause of death was ruled as **""prescription drug overdose""** \\- the coroner who made the report was flabbergasted that he was on such a cocktail of medications. When we asked the rehab program about his medications, they said his dosages were standard procedure for all recovering drug addicts (I\'m wondering if they had him on methadone?).\n\nI do not know what medications he was on. My mom requested medical records from the rehab center **4 times before they finally complied and sent them over** (and they only complied after she contacted the owner in frustration). She just received physical copies of his records, but I can\'t get them from her until I visit home next month. I\'m also uncertain about whether their delay is a red flag or not - maybe they\'re just slammed with work, but it doesn\'t help assuage any questions about whether foul play was involved and then covered up.\n\n*Other details about my brother\'s health:*\n\n\\- He was addicted to ""whatever could get him high"" so he struggled with both meth and heroin/opioids at various points. His most recent relapse (\\~3 months before his death) involved meth.\n\n\\- He had **bulimia that went untreated for years.** He had been to the emergency room multiple times over the past few years with dangerously low potassium - he was very close to going into cardiac arrest a couple years ago and stayed in the hospital for a week on an IV. I think the eating disorder did long term damage to his body, but at the time of his death he had been learning how to cook and eat better as he was working on his recovery. He had been in treatment for months at that point. He cooked chili for all his friends right before he died.\n\n\\- As I said before, he was sober when he died, which sparks many of my questions...\n\nWhat caused him to ""stiffen up"" in the first place? Could internal bleeding caused from being hit kickstart such a reaction, or maybe a severe panic attack? The coroner firmly said that he did not die of a heart attack and she maintains it was prescription drug overdose, so I wonder why he died *then* if he had been on those meds for a few months? Could there have been an adverse reaction between all of his medications and the two doses of Narcan?\n\nI know this is a behemoth of a post, so I apologize, and please know that I greatly appreciate any insight that anyone has to offer. I\'m not sure whether it\'s worth it to dig into his medical records/the official reports of his death, so I\'m partially asking whether you all think that his death is explainable based on these facts, or whether there\'s more to find out here?\n\nI also would like to say, for posterity, that I do not blame either the person who hit my brother or the staff member at the sober living program for my brother\'s death. I understand that neither are at fault, and I only hope that they can move on from this event that was traumatizing to all involved. I just want closure, I guess? I wonder a lot about how he died. My biggest fear is that he died of a broken heart - from crying so hard - because he felt alone/hurt (I had recently gone no contact with him). I don\'t even know if that\'s possible in this situation.\n\nAny insight is greatly appreciated.'"

If i don\'t take my pollen medicine I\'m pretty much bed bound. I live in Denmark and I\'m aware that not all have access to the same thing but i will share with you what i do to combat my allergies and hopefully it will help other people.\n\nA small side note before the list, it is possible to get ""vaccinated"" against most allergies however its not cheap and takes a long time. The process is called  allergen immunotherapy and works by injecting small amount of the thing you are allergic to into your arm. The dose is then slowly increased, and you need to get a shot every few month for a 3-5 years. At the start you need a shot every week. I have tried this once but i had to move to the other side of the country and was not able to continue the program, hoping to start again this year. I needed to buy the veils for injection my self and they cost about 2500 dkk ($355,41) per veil and you need to get more then just one, I suspect that it will be even more expensive in the USA. It\'s also possible to get this in pill form but i have not tried that. Just wanted to let people know that it is a possibility.\n\n# Preparation \n\n* Have you medication ready before the pollen season starts\n   * Antihistamine pills: Try to find a pill that works for you,  different people will react different to the active compounds, work with your doctor to find one that works for you. I currently use altifex 180 mg. (Active compound is fexofenadinhydroclorid)\n   * Nasal spray: Don\'t just get a normal nasal spray get a allergy specific one. you don\'t want to get rid of the mucus you want to reduce your body\'s reaction to pollen\n   * Eye drops: same as the nasal spray you want your body to have a reduced reaction so get eye drops for allergies. \n   * Your doctor can get you stronger medicine then you can get at a pharmacy, so if you are able go talk to them.\n* Have plenty of bed linens ready.\n* Have plenty of clothe ready\n* Pray that exams and other important events do not collide with the peak in pollen season.\n   * When possible try to reschedule events especially if they are out doors.\n\n# Pollen season\n\n* Start taking all your medication on the 1. day of pollen season. \n   * you might not feel like its needed but some medication might take a few days before you get the full effect.\n* Take your medication around the same time every day to make sure you get 24h coverage.\n   * i suggest taking your medication first thing in the morning especially the pills. Taking your pills before breakfast will help your body absorb the pill faster.\n* Take Showers at least one time everyday, you might need more showers some days - be aware of your water usage though. \n   * Showers help get pollen of you body, you don\'t need to use soap every time the water it self does a good job. \n   * Decide whether to take your daily shower in the morning or evening. There are pros and cons for both.\n      * Evening shower: take a shower a short time before you go to bed. This reduces the amount of pollen you carry into the bed and you might get better sleep.\n      * Morning shower: shower when you wake up. Gets rid of any pollen that have gathered on you during the night and freshens you up for the day.\n   * Change into clean clothe after every shower even if you have only used a t-shirt for half a day. Pollen gathers on the clothes and the point of the shower is to get rid of the pollen.\n   * I don\'t know whether hot or cold water works the best, try to find out what works best for you. However i do have some thoughts on this. Hot or warm water opens your pores which might make it easier to get rid of the pollen. Cold water kinda numbs your body so it can feel really nice. One idea could be to take a warm/hot shower to clean out all your pores and then end with a cold shower to close your pores again. Again haven\'t really experiment with this just some thought i have made on the subject.\n* Change your bed linens at least one time per week. Even if you take shower before you go to bed pollen will gather on your bed linens so keeping them fresh can help get a good nights sleep.\n   * pro tip: If you do this every Sunday your Monday will be better as there is few things as good a sleeping with new bed linens.\n* Keep windows and doors closed during the day Open them in the evening or over night. Their is less pollen in the air in the evening or during the night so ventilating your rooms at these times is the most optimal.\n* Don\'t use toilet paper to blow your nose if it can be avoided. Toilet paper is more coarse then you think and it will remove the skin from your nose which i think we all know sucks. Get some good quality tissues maybe even with balsam to reduce the toll it take on your skin.\n   * If/when you have removed the top skin from your nose try using a lib balm on your nose. I find this to be really helpful and makes the nose heal faster. Do be aware that if you have many small rifts it might burn when you first apply it. There might be something made specifically for this but i have not found it yet.\n* Do not blow your nose too much. I have no idea how to do this but i know that if you blow your nose too much it starts burning inside your nostrils. Your body will then start producing mucus to reduce the burning. Try to let this mucus be even though its likely is very fluid, it will help in the long run.\n\nI think that\'s all. If you have any tips yourself share them in the comments and i might add them to the post to make it easy for people to find. Also if you want any clarification i will try to answer as best as i can.\n\nEdit: some spelling plus a few more tips:\n\n* Dont dry your clothe outside use a tumbler or hang it indoors.\n* Keep your house/apartment/room clean.

I was prescribed seroquel a couple years ago and was taking 25mg/day max till I got really sick (presumably covid) in March. Long story short I had symptoms for months and stopped telling my doctors about the bipolar2 diagnosis bc 1. they literally weren\'t believing me and told me it was all in my head and refused to help and 2. I figured that with the intense brain fog I was experiencing, I had no actual depressive or manic episodes so it didn\'t really matter anymore. Needless to say, I decided that I need help for more immediate issues as I was experiencing 24/7 debilitating dizziness (along with other symptoms) since March and that I would not bring this up to doctors so they wouldn\'t gaslight me or write me off. Nine months later I FINALLY was able to see a neurologist after begging my gp for months for help with it, and the neuro diagnosed me with vestibular migraines and prescribed 10mg of amitriptyline a day. I didn\'t want to take this bc lexapro had sent me into a manic state years ago, but I also wasn\'t ready to explain to my doctors why (honestly I don\'t trust them yet and I\'m just not ready to deal with it and ""come out"" about it). Anyways, I tried an anticonvulsant that didn\'t really help with the dizziness, so I reluctantly agreed to the amitriptyline. I\'m taking a smaller dose till I work up to 10mg. I know these doses are tiny, but I am sensitive to meds and want to be prepared if a manic episode comes my way. Does anyone take or has anyone taken any combo of these two medications? I could take the ami every night but a couple a week (neuro was originally debating between every night and every other night for me), so I could switch a night here and there to seroquel (I have been prescribed this on an as needed basis in the past). I do want to stay on the ami for now at least to see if it works. Any thoughts??'"

methocarbamol,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/qg8qe7/jointneck_pains_coughing_quite_a_messy_case/,b'Joint/Neck pains + coughing (quite a messy case)',,"b' \n\nHello there :)\n\nAfter several years of seeing many a doctor, who all failed to see anything remotely wrong, I\'m trying to see if y\'all would have an idea! It\'s a bit of a clusterfuck of non-specific symptoms, that are highly invalidating, most of which have lasted for a while. Of course, impossible to know which ones are linked to one another, and which ones aren\'t, so it\'s even funnier!\n\nMight be something stupidly simple nobody thought about, might be a crazy zebra. Hopefully someone around here have seen something before and might help \\^\\^\'\n\nSo, let\'s go with a chronology. Please remember, I cannot say if those symptoms are linked.\n\n**- December 2006: Severe chronic cough**  \n***Context***: after a severe pharyngitis, the fever and soreness went away, but the coughing remained forever. The cough is a tickling one around the larynx, as if the valve between the oesophagus and trachea didn\'t properly close. To make it weirder, the cough only happens when it\'s cold (autumn/winter/spring or if there\'s air conditioning). If it\'s warm, nothing happens. Finally, the coughing fits are quite severe, enough for me to break my own ribs (happened 2 times) and pop blood vessels in the face (happened too many times to count).\n\n**- September-to-December 2012: Right-side joint pain (arm/hand)**  \n***Context***\\*:\\* after quite a long time playing some intense League of Legends (ah, challenger league...), my joints in the right hand started hurting severely, to the point of making playing impossible. The pain is radiating from the Carpometacarpal and Metacarpophalangeal joints of the ring and pinky fingers, as well as the Ulnocarpal joint. It\'s a constant, deep-feeling, dull ache. It gets worse if there are repeated movements (e.g.: clicking fast, moving back and forth, ...). The constant pain is a 2-3/10 nowadays, and it goes up to a solid 7-8/10 if I have to do those repeated movements.\n\n**- June 2019: Left-side joint pain (arm/hand).**  \n***Context***: Exactly the same as the right-side pain, except it was caused by a whole week of CTRL+C/CTRL+V\'ing at work, because I had to help a colleague. The spreading of the pinky finger to press CTRL and the index finger to press C/V ended up causing the same kind of pain I have on the right side. Just like on the right side, it\'s a constant 2-3/10 pain, that can move up to a 7-8/10 if I use my left hand a lot.\n\n**- March 2021: Left-side neck pain.**  \n***Context***: Once more a dull deep pain that will not disappear. It popped out of nowhere one morning, and is severe enough to radiate all the way to the eye (causing a severe migraine) and down in the shoulder. The general painful area is around the top of the Levator scapulae muscle, although the muscle itself may not be the main cause (it\'s just \\*this area\\*).\n\n**WHAT WAS DONE AND TRIED:**  \nOf course I saw a broad variety of doctors, here\'s what was found out (or more like never found out).  \n\\- **COUGHING:**  \nSinus CT scan: negative (no trace of any problem).  \nA broad variety of nasal sprays, such as Azelastine And Fluticasone: no effect on the cough  \nSeveral steroidian and non-steroidian anti-allergics: no effect on the cough  \nPulmonary function test: done in 2007, all good. Another one will be done in 2 weeks, most likely with the same result.  \nAllergic scratch test: no allergies found.  \nNose cleaning apparatus (Rhino horn/Neti pots): no effect on the coughing.  \nActisoufre (sulfur nose spray): some efficiency in calming a coughing fit.  \nChlorhexidine digluconate tabs: some efficiency in calming a coughing fit.  \n*So far, three otorhinolaryngologists have given up.*\n\n**- HAND/ARM PAINS:**  \nEchography looking for tendinitis in the wrist, elbow and shoulder: nothing to see, all good.  \nElectromyogram: results are perfect.  \nMRI of both hands: all looks perfect so far, no trace of arthritis.  \nMRI of the neck and brain: no trace of disc hernias or brain tumors.  \nAngiogram: checked the arm, for a potential Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. All good, circulation\'s fine.  \nNSAIDs: no effect. Tried ibuprofene, diclofenac (tablets & gel), ketoprofene, prednisolone, to no avail.  \nMuscle relaxants: no effect. Tried methocarbamol (gel & tablets).  \nParacetamol: mild effect.  \n""Just some rest"": no effect. While resting the hands and arms does lower the pain, the pain never goes below 2/10. Also, using them AT ALL will make the pain flare back up, no matter how long they had rested in the first place.  \nKinesitherapy: No effect.  \nHeat: definitely helps and lowers the pain level dramatically (but it has to be really warm, like 30+C)  \n*So far, two internists and three rheumatologists have flat-out given up, saying ""it\'s just like that sometimes"".*\n\n**- NECK PAIN:**  \nMuscle relaxants: no effect.  \nCelecoxib: extremely effective, but only for a short period of time (after \\~3 months, it has no effect).  \nKetoprofene: extremely effective (but causes several lovely digestive issues that become hard to live with after more than a week).  \nMRI: no trace of hernia or ankylosing spondylitis.  \n*For the moment, one rheumatologist has ended up dismissing it as ""just a torticollis"". I\'m not aware of any torticollis that reacts to Celecoxib and lasts for over 6 months but y\'know.*\n\n**PATIENT HISTORY:**  \nDiabetic (type 1), since 1991. Well balanced, HBA1C evolves around \\~5.6% and \\~6.2%. Treated via standard basal/bolus (Tresiba/Fiasp pens).  \nBenign thyroid nodule, removed in 2017. T3, T4 and TSH levels are just fine. No specific medication taken.  \nMild autism/ADD combo. No specific medication taken (except a fuckton of coke zero / tea for the caffeine in order to be vaguely functional).  \nAppendicitis in 2001. Was quite severely infected, but now it\'s gone.  \nSleep apnea. Treated with a breathing thing that is making nights even more annoying.  \nAdenoidectomy at 2 years old, following a (hell of a) lot of ear infections.\n\nCurrently, there are no theories. My GP would like to check collagen-related issues, but with very little hope. Next steps are to see a new internist in Paris, to run a new pulmonary function test, and see an audiologist (ORL specialized in the larynx/pharynx area). Of course, as usual, it will yield fucking nothing lol.\n\nSo there you have it! It\'s starting to be a bit of a problem, because I essentially can barely use my hands for more than an hour, and I live with an almost constant head and neck ache (that of course makes it extremely difficult to sleep in any position). And of course, coughing all the damn time.  \nAs I mentioned,I have no idea if those are linked, or not. But they\'re the reason why I wish I could just sleep for 50 years until someone can figure this shit out - cause life is seriously not worth living right now, after 10 years of that shit.\n\nAgain, I\'m (somewhat) hoping someone around here may have seen the same kinds of issues. Fixing just ONE of those would be a life changer, so... you never know :) Thanks!'"

I mean SSRIs and all the other ADs also have bad withdrawals and I came off them many times. It probably cant be worse?\n\n7. What side effects occur?

My blood pressure was also elevated, but not too dangerous. It\'s now day 7, and my resting heart rate is between 75 when lying down to 85-105 when sitting up at a desk.

Please keep in mind that my heart rate before going on Atenolol was lower, roughly around 65-70 bpm at rest.

influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/fbq7e1/possible_enamel_hypoplasia_what_to_do/,b'Possible enamel hypoplasia - what to do',,"b'I\'m 18F and have been going to the dentist every 6-12 months since I was born. I\'ve never had poor oral hygiene (always brush twice a day with flouride toothpaste, even as a wee baby), floss like sometimes, never used whitening toothpaste or whiteners, and have always had sensitive teeth. \n\n\n\nMy teeth have always been cold sensitive (as in, to cold things), but since I was about 15-16, actively chewing anything with too much sugar in it (e.g. chocolate) leaves me with about 10 minutes of intense, horrible pain. Mostly back teeth. I\'ve brought this up with my dentist half a dozen times, because I can\'t even eat cereal and milk without my teeth hurting for at least 5 minutes afterwards. He says he can\'t see any damage or forming damage in my back teeth (though I did have an inexplicable cavity in my front teeth which has now been filled), and that my teeth simply shouldn\'t hurt. Well they do. \n\n\n\nAt 10 weeks old (too young for the vaccine), I had a pretty bad case of the chicken pox w bad fever, for about a week or two. I also got my first teeth at 3 months (12-13 weeks) if that matters. Just last year I discovered that this can lead to enamel hypoplasia in permanent teeth. Assuming this is true, I probably have thin enamel, easily damaged enamel, whatever, just not good, and this has lead to sensitivity. This sensitivity seems to have gotten worse after braces and plates (glued in), possibly because my teeth were damaged during the orthodontic process from not being able to brush properly.\n\n\n\nWhat I do: brush teeth 2-3 times a day with flouride toothpaste, always one marked ""for sensitive teeth"" (currently Colgate sensitive multi protection if that matters) and ALSO apply a tooth mousse to any problem areas. I don\'t currently use mouthwash but could, I guess. I dont know what benefits versus deficits alcohol free mouthwash has on sensitive teeth. I also stay away from sugar more often because it just hurts, but any temperature change hurts more, so if I\'m drinking cold water and have hot food, the hot food will hurt my teeth then, even if it normally wouldn\'t hurt if I weren\'t drinking the cold water. My dentist told me I damaged my enamel by eating too much fruit (acidic fruit like oranges and mandarins) but what do I do about that? \n\n\n\nI get my teeth cleaned at the dentist every 6 months and it\'s hell, I\'ve asked them to numb my mouth for cleaning before because I\'d rather have like 8 lidocaine syringes than the pain of cleaning. \n\n\n\nI don\'t know what else I can do? If I had $40,000, I would have a full set of veneers done, but I don\'t, and I know what else I can do. My sensitivity has never gotten better, even with so much extra flouride care. In fact, it has gotten worse as I\'ve gotten older. I could be flossing more (we all could), but I don\'t understand why people can get away with never flossing, never using tooth mousse, brushing their teeth like maybe 1-2 times a day and never having a problem. Are flouride tablets still a thing? Are they a good idea?\n\n\nEdit: also always used the soft bristled toothbrush, currently don\'t have an electric one but have used them before.'"

I didn't go to the dentist for over ten years and bad habits led to cavities, tartar build up and gum recession. Im very worried about my gums around my lower incisors. I have 3 to 4 mm regression and I'm having deep cleaning around my entire mouth and I'm getting some fillings.\n\nIf I brush the wrong way, flaps of gum will pop out and i have to put them back in their spot and every time it happens My chest freezes with anxiety and I freak out until I get it back to its spot which only takes a second. My loose gums in the front are really the thing I'm worried about. I'm not as scared about fillings or deep cleaning in the other spots of my mouth.\n\nMy dentist prescribed me Triazolam for oral sedation and hydrocodone and acedrometaphen for pain and apparently I'll also be on nitrous too for the work. I'd like to know what to expect when I take the meds especially from someone who has taken it before.\n\nI've asked at the office and they told me what I already knew. That I would feel a bit drunk and tired and that I might not remember anything. I understand that this is pretty much it but I just don't feel satisfied with it I want to know more. Also my dentist said that my gums will reform around my teeth after the cleaning and I would like to know what to expect with my recovery. \n\nThere's a lot of regression in the front and I'm worried about if it's going to grow back in a good way. I understand that my gums will never get back to normal and that I will have gaps between my teeth. I'm ok with that I just want to be able to eat without feeling like im pushing food into the pockets. I want to be able to swish mouthwash without feeling the flaps pop out of place.\n\n**Update**: The appointment went fine. I took .375mg of Halcion an hour before the appointment and it just made me not care about being there at all. They gave me the last .125mg pill during the appointment. It made the feeling of the dentist dilling out my cavities totally normal. Like as normal as taking the trash out or pumping gas. I had no anxiety about it. It made me feel calm and I could focus on the fact that he's a dentist drilling out cavities and that's just what they do. Totally normal. Also the shots didnt really hurt that much since they put numbing gel on first. On a scale from 1 to 10 it's a 1. It hurt just enough to feel it as pain but I could barely tell I was getting the shots. Any pain I felt only bothered me when I felt it but as soon as it stopped I completely stopped caring about it. The cleaning under my gums hurt a bit but it was manageable. The drill didnt hurt at all.\n\nI was also on the gas and that made me feel like I was flying and I actually forgot where I was a few times and apparently I slept through some of it. My appointment was at 8am and during a break from the drilling and cleaning I asked what the time was. It was 10am. Two hours passed but it felt like 15 minutes to me. My whole appointment took 4 hours but it felt like maybe 30 minutes to me. They gave me a warm blanket and put something over my eyes so I couldnt see the tools and everything going on. I was super comfortable.\n\nWhen I got home I took some ibuprofen and waited for the numbing to go away then a few hours later I took my pain meds that they gave me Norco which is Hydrocodone and Acetaminophen (Vicodin and Tylenol). I had all of my tartar removed and I got 6 cavities filled and I had to have some of the top of my molars drilled and filled so 10 fillings total. The only pain im in is a sore jaw from having my mouth open for 4 hours. Thats it. My gums dont hurt and my fillings dont hurt. I can drink cold water and it doesnt bother me.\n\nIm typing all of this because in the weeks leading up to my appointment I was trying to find out what to expect and I couldn't really find anything. I tried to read about the effects of Halcion and Norco and the gas but a lot of sites don't go into detail on what to expect or they don't give me the ansers I wanted. So I'm writing this for anyone in the future who has to take any of the meds that I took and maybe reading about my experience will help you. Heres a quick desription on what the medicine felt like but keep in mind it might not be exactly the same since everyone processes stuff slightly differently but this should give you a good idea.\n\nThe **Halcion** desolved on my tongue very quickly and I started to feel it 20 minutes later. I felt slower like my movements had a delay and I had little to no anxiety. The **Nitrous oxide** was a bit cold and It made me feel like I was floating/flying and I felt like I was out of my body and I couldnt understand what they were saying except when they were talking directly to me. Its really not scary though. Honestly if you've ever smoked. Marijuana that's what it's like and you feel like you're on the edge of sleep. **Norco** didnt make me feel weird. It just got rid of the pain and made me feel a bit tired.\n\nWhen I left I felt pretty much normal just kind of tired. I remember most of the entire day except for the stuff that I missed since I was sleeping through some of it. \n\nSo Halcion+Nitrous oxide+numb= 10/10."""

Found her an appointment tomorrow to get the extraction. \n\nShe then calls us later saying she had to cancel that OS appt because it was too expensive (I believe it was around 350-400 without insurance). She also asked if she can receive Norco for pain management. The DA talked to her saying I can't prescribe her that medication and recommended taking tylenol and to get the tooth extracted as soon as possible like we had originally scheduled her because that is the source of pain. She then called again later asking again for the prescription, and had to talk to the front desk receptionist who explained to her again that we can't give her that prescription. The patient and her mom starts yelling on the phone saying pain is not good for the baby and ridiculous our office is because we can't provide norco and hangs up. Head doc said this is classic behavior of drug seeking. \n\nDoes anyone have experiences on patients who ask for narcotics and if so, how to manage their angry reactions when we say no?"""
emgality,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/mpye68/hormonal_acne_issues_are_ruining_my_self_esteem/,b'Hormonal Acne Issues are Ruining my Self Esteem...',,"b'I stumbled upon this subreddit after my Curology bottle ran out, and I began to Google things when I panicked. I figured you guys may have some advice for me. Im a 25yo female, and my curology formula has azaleic acid, clindamyacin, and zinc pyriethione. I use hydrocolloid bandages, and i was previously using a ton of salicylic acid products. I think a lot of my acne is more cystic than anything, my pimples rarely come to a head, and usually hurt.\n\nI suffered from acne in high school, and it died down until about a year ago. I have no thyroid, but I think the big trigger is my once a month emgality shot. I get HORRID migranes 5 or 6 days a week without this medication, so I dont want to stop it, however, the acne it causes is really bothering me. Curology has been working excellent, but I dont know if I want to continue it anymore due to the price point vs product amount. What can I do to combat this problem? I have never been one to take good care of my skin in the past, but I really do not want to continue to scar up my face. I was content with my appearance for so long, and its keeping me from doing so much. I dont even want to look at myself in the mirror. Please reccomend some awesome products for someone with hella oily skin that is sometimes sensitive. I just lost a ton of weight, and I want to be confident about my face too.'"

I hesitate for a long time to ask help here but today is the day! I'm sorry it will be quite long and English is not my first language so I apologize if I make any mistake. \n\nIt's been 2 years since I have adult and inflammatory acne. I think it's due to a second effect from the COVID vaccination during the summer. It became even worse when I start to use mask with my natural oily skin and my lack of skincare (pictures 1 and 2).\n\nI decided to see my GP after almost one year.  She prescribed me Adapalene and BP. But I didn't know how to use it properly and with no sunscreen at all during the summer, my skin became irritated obviously. I stopped for two weeks, and only sed Adapalene after that. After one month, I developed barely a pimple (pictures 3, 4). BUT I wanted to try something from Paula's Choice and it broke me so bad. I used it two days and BAM ! Big pimples. The scars are red and big, even now after almost 1 year.\n\nThen, I saw a dermatologist in September. Well, it wasn't a good choice. I explained that I have 2 illnesses (diabetes type 1 and coeliac disease). When I explained to him that if I eat even a bit of gluten I develop pustules, he said that I was lying. He also said that I poke my pimples so that's why I have small scars while in reality I don't touch my skin... Diabete could do that and I think Adapalene isn't enough to stop my face to scar sadly. I continue to use it and he prescribed me Skinoren. After 4 months or so, I stopped using the latter. It helped me tremendously with my pimples and my PIE but I was redder and it didn't feel right. I was having more pimples even after 3 months and my skin was so tight. Maybe because it was the cream and not the gel version ? After this and the fact that he didnt care about the impact on my mental health at all, I stopped seeing him and for some reasons in Paris it's so difficult to find a dermatologist... 5 months to 1 year to see one, and 3 times they canceled our appointment at the last minute.\n\nThis February, my GP prescribed me with doxycycline, saying that since I don't have many pimples it will surely be enough with Adapalene. It seems it wasn't enough. I stop it the 5th May, and I start developing pimples some days before. But I know I am in a stressful period with my final exams so it could be it.\n\nIt's not even the pimples that stress me out, but the PIE to be honest (even more than the ice pick scars). Every pimple leaves me a red mark. I hate it, and I fear to use makeup and badly remove it, making things worse ahah. Doxycycline helped me a lot about this ! But I don't want to use it more than 3 months to be honest. My gut health won't allow a second round I fear. \n\nI thought about Tretinoin. Since this August it will be a full year that I use Adapaelene, it seems it isn't enough to totally clear my face. However, I feel like it makes my face sensitive. Sometimes I flush for not reason. Can we develop rosacea like this ? (Last 4 pictures) And after I apply Adapalene nightly, my skin is a bit red, flaky etc. Maybe I do too much and I compromise my skin barrier, but I fear at the same time that if I stop for some days, it will be even worse. For all that, it doesn't happen every night, so I am even more confused. \n\nMy skincare since three-four months : \n\nMorning : \n- SVR Sensifine Double Cleansing Balm \n\n- SVR Soap Free cleanser SEBIACLEAR with gluconolactone (oily acne prone skin) \n\n- SVR Mattifying Moisturiser SEBIACLEAR (gluconolactone 4%, a bit of Salicylic Acid, mat SR 2%)\n\n- SPF SVR Extreme Sun Secure gel ultra mat (I know it contains a bit of perfume and it bothers me but many sunscreens broke me out...) every 2-3h when I'm outside / 1-2 times if I am at home.\n\nNight : \n\n- SVR Sensifine Double Cleansing Balm \n\n- SVR Soap Free cleanser SEBIACLEAR with gluconolactone (oily acne prone skin) \n\n- a pie size of Adapalne Zentiva 0.1 cream (2 days then 1 day without to rest) \n\n- Noreva Sensidiane soothing cream for sensible skin or Dermina Senslina --> normal skin both \n\nHence, do you think I do too much ? Does I develop sensitive skin prone to rosacea ?  If some people were in the same case, do you think it's safe to go from Adapalene to Tretinoin or even with Finacea gel then ? Or do you think I could ask other options ? \n\nI know there is a link to my stress level. I'm working on it. It's also linked to my hormones but I use a birth control pill already and I did a test that seems too normal for my GP to worry more about it..."""

I have tried most treatments including accutane, tret, antibiotics, etc. I am currently on lymecycline and use Differin gel / benzoyl peroxide which I have been doing for a few years (when I have tried to come off the antibiotics my acne has become far worse and my gp / endocrinologist advised to continue treatment). My skin is not perfect on this treatment but works well enough, I still continually will have 2 painful cystic spots at a time, but is ok. \n \nI had covid mid October and afterwards wondered why my skin was so clear (I thought maybe covid had had an impact on my hormones / pcos and caused things to improve! However slowly my skin started to clog and spots appear again. \n\nRecently a few weeks before Christmas I started a low gluten diet (I am DF already and low sugar for pcos). I have not managed to stick to this that well over the Christmas break as you can imagine but going to continue to see what effect it has. \nI also stopped using my usual spfs - Heliocare 360 oil free gel and Heliocare gel. I did not do this intentionally but because I was off work, mostly inside at home and its winter in the UK, switched to my it cosmetics cc cream spf 40 matte. Well my skin is completely clear. I have not had 1 spot in 2 weeks and have not had any pre menstrual spots which I usually get reliably. I was quite excited that its the low gluten diet. However it suddenly occurred to me about the lack of SPF. Im going to start using Heliocare again but on just 1 side of my face to try to see whether its the diet or spf, any other suggestions on how I could test this out would be welcome!\n\n\nQuestion: has anyone experienced this, and does anyone have any recommendations for SPF which they like at the moment? \n\nThank you!'"

Last week my eldest jumped off something at recess and smashed her eyebrow, which required stitches, so that was fun. My two year old will not poop normally, which means she does tiny poops ten times a day and has had so many diaper changes she now has a bleeding rash and she still won't poop. She fights me at every change and screams and cries and even though I am so gentle I can tell it hurts and I just want to cry. It breaks my heart. I've tried every thing that I can think of.

keppra,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/v772q7/memory_loss_mental_health_medications/,b'Memory Loss & Mental Health Medications',,"b""Memory loss is a common topic within the mental health world. I'm an RN that works in Mental Health & going to do my best to summarize some research on *which* mental health medications impact our memory and *why* they do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will Include the link to the original post that is probably easier to follow but also going to include all the info below.\n\n[https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/](https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs**\n\n**citalopram, celexa, escitalopram, lexapro, fluoxetine, prozac, sarafem, symbyax, fluvoxamine, luvox, luvox CR, paroxetine, paxil, paxil CR, pexeva, sertraline, zoloft, vilazodone, viibryd**\n\nDrug class\n\nThis is a very common drug class; prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, migraines, panic attacks, eating disorders, PTSD, OCD, and even chronic pain. Over 10% of the US takes an SSRI.\n\nWhat Do SSRIs Do?\n\nWhat does every medication within this class have in common? They all increase the level of Serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. When you take a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, youre blocking the neurons from reabsorbing Serotonin, meaning there is more Serotonin available.\n\nSo what does Serotonin do? Well, A LOT. Serotonin influences our mood and emotional state, our digestion, appetite, our sleep cycle. It is found in your brain, in your intestines and even in your blood. One could argue that it impacts everything.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nSerotonin is even in animals, plants and fungus. While we can measure the levels in our blood we cannot measure the levels within our brain. Meaning were all in the dark as to how much is within our brain and whether or not its even correlated to the amount in our blood.\n\nHow SSRIs Impact Memory\n\nAge and gender do not seem to influence the data that SSRIs are correlated with memory effects. Something that is important to mention, is that while research has shown that SSRIs are *correlated* with memory loss, that doesnt exactly mean that they CAUSE it. Correlation and cause are two different things. Many people that take SSRIs also take benzodiazepines, drink, smoke, have genetic predisposition to memory loss, etc. Depression and anxiety themselves can even cause memory problems.\n\nSummary\n\nSo, after reading through many articles, there overall wasnt enough credible information to emphatically say that an SSRI causes memory loss. In fact, I came across more research that suggested SSRIs improve cognitive performance and memory. Some data also specifically supported that SSRIs can improve memory for patients experiencing psychosis and depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tricyclic Antidepressant | TCAs**\n\n**anafranil, clomipramine, asendin, amoxapine, elavil, amitriptyline, norpramin, desipramine, pamelor, nortriptyline, sinequan, doxepin, surmontil, trimipramine, tofranil, imipramine, vivactil, protiptyline**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThe word tricyclic refers to the three molecular ring shapes associated with this drug class. These existed before SSRIs, but they seem to cause more side effects. This has led to SSRIs being more commonly prescribed nowadays. TCAs are still often administered for things like anxiety, depression, migraines, panic disorder, eating disorders, mood disorders, insomnia, hormone disorders, bedwetting, and even nerve pain.\n\nWhat do Tricyclic Antidepressants Do?\n\nWhat do all TCAs have in common? Similar to an SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants impact neurotransmitters. But, in addition to serotonin, they also block the reabsorption of norepinephrine. They ALSO block acetylcholine receptors. These key differences create a cascade of effects in the body that do impact memory. These key differences are also the culprit for the common side effects in this drug class like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nIn 1945, the Sulphur bridge of the phenothiazine ring of promethazine was altered to synthesize G22355 ( a weak antihistamine and mild anticholinergic with sedative properties). The new 'invention' was tested as an antipsychotic. It was ineffective for schizophrenia, but did have antidepressant properties. Thus, the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) was discovered.\n\nHow TCAs Impact Memory\n\nThere are multiple reasons why a TCA impacts our memory. **The first reason** is that we retain memory best when norepinephrine is released at an optimal rate. These drugs block the reabsorption of norepinephrine; which is known to be a moderator of memory. With too much of it, we are anxious and stressed, too little of it and we are drowsy and not as coherent. Either way, the drug has an impact on norepinephrine which directly influences how we store memory.\n\n**The second reason** why this drug class impacts memory is because it competes with our natural antagonists on muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors. It is well documented that these drugs block muscarinic receptors (which is an acetylcholine receptor), and acetylcholine directly impacts learning and memory.\n\n>*Muscarinic*acetylcholine*receptors* in the hippocampus and cortex underlie*memory*formation\n\nSummary\n\nSo, TCAs are a drug that research has linked with memory impairments and dementia. These drugs interfere with our bodies baseline of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. As with any drug; sometimes they create an optimal effect on a person, as for others, not so much. If a person is too excitable and anxious, a TCA can improve their quality of life (even could improve memory if their extreme anxiety was impairing it), while for another it can make them drowsy and leave a bad impression.\n\n\\*Note each drug within the class impacts the degree of these effects a little differently.\n\nIf youre feeling like doing a deep dive into some of the articles I read to gain clarity, by all means, click the links below!\n\n[Differential Cognitive Actions of Norepinephrine 2 and 1 Receptor Signaling in the Prefrontal Cortex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4876052/)\n\n[The effect of tricyclic antidepressants on cholinergic responses of single cortical neurones.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1666268/?page=7)\n\n[A brief history of antidepressant drug development: from tricyclics to beyond ketamine](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/acta-neuropsychiatrica/article/brief-history-of-antidepressant-drug-development-from-tricyclics-to-beyond-ketamine/B5C9D55C6299BC41B237187DB609DB68)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Benzodiazepines**\n\n**alprazolam, xanax, chlordiazepoxide, librium, clonazepam, klonopin, clorazepate, tranxene, diazepam, valium, lorazepam, ativan, oxazepam, serax, temazepam, restoril, triazolam, halcion**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThese are commonly considered anti-anxiety medication (though can be used for seizures, insomnia, and muscle spasms). They work by quickly slowing down important parts of our brain.\n\nLets taco bout it.\n\nThis drug class specifically targets the GABA-A receptor, enhancing its effect, which slows down our central nervous system; this makes us feel relaxed, because the drug has retarted a major gear in our system (sometimes this is EXACTLY what we need).\n\nDid You Know?\n\nAnesthesiologists often give Versed (a benzodiazepine) so patients will not remember surgery?\n\nHow Benzodiazepines Impact Memory\n\nThis drug class changes our mental state & while the drug is advantageously quick acting, the effects linger. Short-term memory is not as affected, but long-term memory is specifically impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory and thus not consolidated into memory storage. The effects are similar to the long-term effects of alcoholism (alcohol is also a CNS depressant). Both of these substances, used long term actually damage our brain.\n\nThis is why a rehab center isnt going to allow the use of 'said drug' while recovering. This is why therapists often (but not always) stray away from patients taking 'said drug' while trying to work on trauma, recovery, etc. If the brain is not functioning & you're not able to remember anything, how can you work on it? The most effective aspects of benzodiazepines are precisely why individuals have a tendency to become dependent on them.\n\nNow, don't shoot the messenger. Obviously, there is a time and a place for benzodiazepines. They're an actual life saver for the (hopefully) occasional panic attack. But how sadistic is that Benzodiazepines have addictive properties, which means that with *repeated* use we will need *increasingly* higher doses, making the dent in your memory more and more indisputable.\n\nFull Disclosure\n\nMy mother was an addict, benzodiazepines being her drug of choice.\n\nDo you know an addict whose drug of choice is a benzodiazepine? No SHAME, but if so, you can probably attest that **they dont remember shit.** \n\nHow about an addict whose drug of choice is alcohol? All love here, but you can say for certain, *they dont remember shit*.\n\nThere has even been a fair amount of data to support that the risk of Alzheimers is elevated in those taking the drug for over 6 months. One Harvard study even speculated that it would raise the risk by 84%! Seems unrealistic, but who am I to question Harvard; I'll add the link below if you're also feeling speculative.\n\nAnother point of concern is that this drug will inhibit your brain from initiating activity of GABA A (since the medication has so kindly been doing it). What this means is that after the drug is long gone from your system, your brain experiences a lag in restoring the normal GABA balance.\n\nThis is often what is referred to as *rebound anxiety* because your anxiety is likely to get worse, before it gets better after taking a benzodiazepine, especially if taken long term.\n\nTake it from a nurse who works in mental health; it's not enjoyable being the bystander of a patient trying to escape their benzo addiction.\n\nBut this is why the mental health world is increasingly trying to move towards low dosing and only prescribing for a limited amount of time.\n\nNow, Benzodiazepines are very dangerous to quit cold turkey, so please dont go flush yours down the toilet after reading this.\n\nWhen Benzodiazepines were first discovered they offered an immediate solution to the overwhelming crippling anxiety that many people face, but the harsh reality is that were now in a benzo addiction crisis. Were learning over time, as a society and those changes dont happen overnight. And trust me, as a mental health professional I myself occasionally grow infuriated at the amount of family doctors who prescribe copious amounts of benzodiazepines only to later turn the patient away after addiction has crippled them.\n\n[Harvard Article Claims Benzodiazepine use may raise risk of Alzheimers disease](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/benzodiazepine-use-may-raise-risk-alzheimers-disease-201409107397#:~:text=People%20who%20had%20taken%20a%20benzodiazepine%20for%20three,84%25.%20The%20type%20of%20drug%20taken%20also%20mattered.)\n\n>Right now Im having amnesia and dj vu at the same time. I think Ive forgotten this before.  \nSteven Wright\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Anti-Epileptics**\n\n**topiramate, topamax, zonisamide, zonegran, levetiracetam, keppra, pregabalin, lyrica, clonazepam, klonopin, rufinamide, banzel, vigabatrin, sabril, phenytoin, dilantin, oxcarbazepine, trileptal, carbamazepine, tegretol, lamotrigine, lamictal, lacosamide, vimpat, valproic acid, depakote, phenobarbital, gabapentin, neurontin**\n\nDrug Class\n\nAnti-seizure medications are commonly used for mood disorders and even anxiety in addition to epilepsy.\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nEpilepsy is caused by **excessive** hyperexcitability of the nervous system therefore, medications in this class are geared toward minimizing excitability. This drug class actually encompasses three different major classes\n\n1. Blocking Sodium Channels\n2. Enhancement of GABA Inhibition\n3. Regulation of Synaptic Releases\n\nWhy it Impacts Memory\n\nOverall, anticonvulsants work in different ways; trust me I rode the magic school for HOURS trying to gain an understanding of them to write this. Truthfully, we still have a lot to learn about them. Their impact is complicated and the effects range based on the dose and drug.\n\nFor instance, Topamax has pretty diverse pharmacologic actions, because of that, it **has** been linked with impaired concentration, cognitive dulling, psychomotor retardation, language and comprehension difficulties, rather extreme effects on short-term memory and working memory, poor verbal fluency and word-finding, reduced IQ scores, abnormal thinking and delayed cognitive speed. Because of this dark cloud of side effects, Topamax is sometimes referred to as 'Dope-A-Max'.\n\nHowever, a more selective medication within the drug class such as Phenytoin or Tegretol are more specific to blocking sodium channels. Overall, they seem to have less impact on memory and cognitive function.\n\nMany of these drugs listed above have an impact on GABA, and long term exposure to GABA agents can alter the functionality of GABA permanently, which means there are potentially permanent consequences to cognition, behaviors, and memory.\n\nPhenobarbital has been linked to lower IQ, and worse effects than Depakote and Tegretol, however it is actually a barbituate. Its effects are similar to benzodiazepines which you can read more about above.\n\nGabapentin, used for seizures and often mood disorders, belongs to it's own drug class. Still, it **has** been linked to memory impairment. Hence, the name, it also impacts GABA, which as mentioned several times now, certainly plays a hand in our ability to remember. At this point there isnt enough research to say its linked to dementia though.\n\nAs far as drugs for epilepsy, Gabapentin is tolerated much better than many others. Its also worth mentioning that this drug seems to have more *short term* effects on memory. Some will experience a disorienting feeling or short term memory loss while taking Gabapentin, but the reports of long term memory being impacted are reported less often.\n\n[Long Term Effects of Gabapentin](https://deserthopetreatment.com/sedatives/gabapentin-addiction/long-term-side-effects/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Antipsychotics**\n\n**sometimes referred to as major tranquilizers or neuroleptics; risperidone, risperdal, quetiapine, seroquel, olanzapine, zyprexa, ziprasidone, zeldox, paliperidone, invega, aripiprazole, abilify, clozapine, clozaril, fluphenazine**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used as the first line treatment for schizophrenia & sometimes used for mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, Tourette's syndrome & Huntington's disease\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nMost drugs in this class work to block Dopamine, though some do impact other chemicals in the brain.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nOddly enough, memory seems to actually be improved when using an antipsychotic for a person with psychotic symptoms, though there are many that take medications within this class that are not psychotic. So let's talk about that more.\n\nWhy It Impacts Memory\n\nFirst, let's skip back to the purpose of these drugs. Schizophrenia is the **major** psychotic disorder we use antipsychotics for. Some of the main symptoms are delusions, lack of motivation, unusual behaviors, and hallucinations. Dopamine has been thought to regulate our brains understanding of our surroundings and what it all means to us. So, it's to be expected that drugs within this class target Dopamine.\n\nThis class is broken up into two categories;\n\n**First Generation (old, typical):** Block Dopamine-2 Receptors, which means they also block acetylcholine, histamine and norepinephrine. which do impact the complex way in which we store memories. \\*More movement disorders come with the old ones.\n\n**Second Generation: (new, atypical):** Block Serotonin and Dopamine Receptors\\*\\*.\\*\\* Less risk of extra movements, increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and weight gain.\n\nWhat do they all have in common? **They impact Dopamine.** Long story short; A delicate balance of Dopamine is needed for memory to function. Since this class targets Dopamine, it's fair to say it has the potential to alter our memory. Whether that's a good or bad thing is specific to the patient, but it's typically an unwelcome effect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Antihistamines**\n\n**brompheniramine, dimetane, benadryl, diphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clistin, clemastine, tavist, doxylamine, unisom, hydroxyzine, atarax, vistaril, promethazine, phenergan, triprolidine, triafed**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used for allergies but also used for anxiety. Antihistamines are divided into different 'generations' & target different histamine receptors in our body.\n\n* H1 Receptors: Found Throughout the Body\n* H2 Receptors: Mostly Stomach Acid Secretion\n* H3 Receptors: Central Nervous System\n* H4 Receptors: Still Being Researched\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nWe're actually still learning a lot about histamines but what we do know is that \\*\\*anti-\\*\\*histamines are usually anticholinergic; **blocking** receptors for choline. The problem is that we need choline to be readily available to have the ability to learn, understand and remember.\n\nWhy it Impacts Memory?\n\nBeing that antihistamines are often anticholinergic, they do impair our ability to think, learn and remember. Especially the first generation antihistamines that easily penetrate our brain. We already naturally produce less acetylcholine overtime. This is partly why as we age our ability to remember, think, and learn diminishes. It's widely known that anticholinergics impact memory, thinking, learning, and muscle function. It is also suggested that these drugs increase the risk of developing dementia.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe only drug within this class that can be given intravenously is Benadryl. Since Benadryl is a first generation, it impacts our body in many ways in addition to the reason why it's administered. Since first generation antihistamines are much less specific in their effects, they are affiliated with greater memory impairment. Though, being the only IV antihistamine available, it is still widely used in hospital settings.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, the effects range. Regarding mental health specifically; Vistaril, hydroxyzine and Atarax are commonly prescribed for anxiety. While your risks are much less severe than benzodiazepines, these are FIRST generation antihistamines. Therefore, they do have a sedating effect (precisely why they can relieve tension) but this is also means they do impair our ability to remember.\n\nAn example of second generation antihistamines are Claritin & Zyrtec. Unlike first generation antihistamines, these do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. Therefore, they relieve many effects of allergies, but do not have as many sedating properties or memory impairments associated with them. When it comes to anxiety though, Claritin & Zyrtec won't do you much good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is the link again for original post below.\n\n[https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/](https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/)"""

I am fully vaccinated and boosted.\n\nI ate some caramel popcorn with cashews, popcorn, caramel coloring, brown sugar, butter, margarine, corn syrup, salt, and baking soda at work on Thursday morning at around 9:45 am. My belief was that the cashews triggered the reaction, but I am not 100% sure because this has never happened before. Within 15 minutes, I suffered a significant allergic reaction but not life threatening. I still could breathe but it was slightly labored. I immediately started coughing, sneezing, and having a sore throat. I then vomited multiple times when I arrived at the urgent care center about 40 minutes after eating the food, started itching all over, and felt really hot. The doctor gave me solu-medrol which is a steroid and zofran which is anti-nausea medication. When my friend took me back home, I had trouble moving and suffered some diarrhea. However, resting at home on Thursday and taking generic Zyrtec allowed me to feel strong enough to go back to work on Friday as I regained my movement and my energy.\n\nSince then, I have not eaten much but have intermittently tried Totino's Cheese Party Pizza which I have eaten many times in the past with absolutely no incident. However, every time I eat it since the reaction occurred, the nerves on the roof and bottom of my mouth start to swell up temporarily. But I am able to swallow it without vomiting it back up or becoming sick to the extent I did with the popcorn.\n\nI also have been suffering intermittent itchiness and occasional coughing even in the past day (the latter of which might still be partially be lingering from the COVID), as well as still feeling hot around my legs sometimes and an aftertaste in my mouth. I took Benadryl around 3 PM today and then fell asleep from 5 PM to 1 AM which is early for me after attempting to eating a small amount of the Totino's one more time.\n\nWhat the hell is going on? I tested negative for gluten sensitivity a little over a month ago and for shrimp and cauliflower allergies around the same time (based on the roof of my mouth tensing up to a lesser extent). I was eating pizza all throughout my quarantine and the day or so after I returned to work up until I suffered the allergic reaction without any problem.\n\nWhen will these reaction just be limited to the allergen again? What can I eat that won't trigger my mouth to feel overly sensitive? I am a nervous wreck because I don't want to suffer another reaction and don't know when the heightened sensitivity is going to end and I'll go back to normal.\n\nTL;DR: Had significant allergic reaction on Thursday morning to caramel popcorn with cashews. Now suffering after-effects as well as roof and bottom of mouth tensing up to previously safe Totino's Cheese Party Pizza. What should I do?"""

Although the initial response was led by a sense of urgency and crisis management, the State Surgeon General believes it is critical that as public health professionals, responses are adapted to the present to chart a future guided by data.\n\nThe State Surgeon General is notifying the health care sector and public of a substantial increase in Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports from Florida after the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.\n\nOverall reports submitted to VAERS, Florida 20062022 - v2\nOverall reports submitted to VAERS, Florida 20062022\nIn Florida alone, there was a 1,700% increase in VAERS reports after the release of the COVID-19 vaccine, compared to an increase of 400% in overall vaccine administration for the same time period (Figure 1). \n\nThe reporting of life-threatening conditions increased over 4,400%. This is a novel increase and was not seen during the 2009 H1N1 vaccination campaign. There is a need for additional unbiased research to better understand the COVID-19 vaccines' short- and long-term effects. \n\nThe findings in Florida are consistent with various studies that continue to uncover such risks. To further evaluate this, the Surgeon General wrote a letter to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) illustrating the risk factors associated with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and emphasizing the need for additional transparency.\n\nAccording to a study, Fraiman J et al, Vaccine. 2022, mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were associated with an excess risk of serious adverse events, including coagulation disorders, acute cardiac injuries, Bells palsy, and encephalitis. This risk was 1 in 550 individuals, which is much higher than other vaccines.\n\nA second study, Sun CLF et al, Sci Rep. 2022, found increased acute cardiac arrests and other acute cardiac events following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nAdditionally, Dag Berild J et al, JAMA Netw Open. 2022, assessed the risk of thromboembolic and thrombocytopenic events related to COVID-19 vaccines and found preliminary evidence of increased risk of both coronary disease and cardiovascular disease.\n\nWhile the CDC has identified safety signals for stroke among individuals 65 and older following the bivalent booster administration, there is a need for additional assessments and research regarding safety of all mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nTo support transparency, the State of Florida reminds health care providers to accurately communicate the risks and benefits of all clinical interventions to their patients, including those associated with the COVID-19 vaccine as additional risks continue to be identified and disclosed to the public.\n\nThe State of Florida remains dedicated to protecting communities from the risks of COVID-19 and other public health concerns, specifically by promoting the importance of treatment and promoting prevention through healthy habits. We encourage our health care partners and providers to do the same."""

Headaches didn't go away. \n\nI then realized my jaw (TMJ) has been clicking and sore since I got fillings at the dentist at the end of January and so I went back to the dentist, they filed down my fillings to correct my bite, but the dentist said if I was clenching/grinding because of my bite and that was causing the headaches it would be in my sleep and I'd wake up with them, not during the day. So, he suggested it was stress related. \n\nI then did some prodding around to figure out the pressure points that were the cause of my headache and again it was my jaw (TMJ). So, I was trying to do exercises for my jaw to fix the clicking. This didn't help the headaches. \n\nI went to my family doctor, she said based on ruling these other things out (I also new they weren't caffeine withdrawal or dehydration headaches) she said they must be tension headaches caused from bad posture, sedentary lifestyle, all day looking at my phone/computer and perhaps also not eating or drinking water til noon most days. A combination of things. She prescribed massage and chiropractics (which I have not done yet but I'm planning on doing both massage and physio therapy).\n\nI then got thinking that maybe my tension isn't coming just from my jaw alone and perhaps from my neck. I deduced that my always slouched/hunched, looking down at my phone, looking down at my laptop positions were shortening/tightening my front neck muscles which was pulling my jaw. At the time of figuring this out I was starting to wake up with jaw pain. \n\nI started doing simple neck stretches (set an alarm and tried to remember to do them every two hours) and the headaches are gone. \n\nTLDR: Was getting tension headaches everyday, took a while to figure out that it was tightened neck muscles causing jaw pain and tension headaches. Simple neck stretches done 4 or 5 times a day or every two hours eliminated the headaches immediately.   \nHope this helps anyone who is also suffering from daily unexplained headaches."""

I've already taken several days off and had a couple meltdowns/panic attacks at work where I've had to go home. I don't know how much longer my manager is going to tolerate this before they start losing their patience. I'm having suicidal thoughts all the time and I'm worried I will act on them at some point. I have acted on these thoughts in the past and it was very unpleasant. I took what would have been several hundred pills of the various psych medicine I'm on. I had dozens of seizures and woke up in the emergency room after having a seizure and I couldn't even remember my name or how old I was. Later on they sent me to ICU and when I was there they told me my heart rythym was not right so they would have to shock my heart back into the right rythym. Once I was out of the medical ward I was in the psych ward for many weeks after. \n\nI've told my psychiatrist and psychologist that I've been suicidal but they don't really do much other than ask if I feel safe. Well right now when you're asking me I'm not going to try and kill myself or when I go home, but I am worried that I might try to before I see you again, which could be a couple weeks. I just say I feel safe even if I'm not sure. I know if I say I don't feel safe then I could go to a psych ward, which I really don't want. Even if I don't feel safe, I don't think I would be able to tell them. If I say I don't feel safe then I have to get an assessment done by a psychiatrist and they will want to know how I plan on killing myself and I just don't want to say because that method will be taken away from me and then I won't be able to kill myself if I feel that I can't cope with this anymore. I'm on methadone at the moment and they give me several days worth to take home. I don't have to go in every day to get it. I get like three days at a time so if I was to save a couple and then take that plus the three all at once I probably would die. We have naloxone at home but if my partner wasn't here she wouldn't be able to give it to me. I also wouldn't want her to be the one that found me. I couldn't leave this world knowing she would be the one to find me.\n\nI'm also really worried that this may be too much for my partner to cope with all of my problems. Her mental health has not been great recently and she's still dealing with the side effects of a concussion which has been very difficult for her to cope with. My partner actually works as a registered nurse at the psych ward which makes it even worse because if I end up there all of her coworkers will know that her partner is a patient. I don't want to make her job even harder for her. (Where I live only has one psych hospital, there's no options to go anywhere else unless you pay to go somewhere private which I can't afford). \n\nI just don't know what to do. Even if I tell the psychiatrist how I'm actually feeling and what my plan to kill myself would be if I were to go through with it, I don't see how anything is going to improve. They put me into a psych ward for a couple weeks? Then what? I'm back home and in the same situation again and then also have an employer that will be really annoyed with me.

I smoke an ecig and recently am starting on Marijuana for my pain]\n\n[Edit 3 to include some blood work context too! For the last few years my blood has had consistently high white counts - mostly lymph but also neutrophils, high Sedimentation Rate, and extremely high c reactive protein]\n\nThe way I would describe it is hypersensitivity to touch. If I get poked or bumped in many (but not all) areas on my body, I feel pain for about two full minutes, to the level of feeling like someone punched me. (Areas include but are not limited to outside of upper arms, outside of ribs, back of calves).\n\nI also have similar pain that lasts about 2 weeks if I apply continuous pressure to almost any spot in my body, such as wearing tight boots/massaging a spot repetitively. This results in that spot being also hypersensitive to touch, but this lasts weeks at a time. \n\nI also have chronic fatigue, and my limbs tend to get tired very quickly, which makes brushing my hair or blowing it or even walking more than a block at a time extremely difficult. \n\nThese symptoms have been present for as long as I could remember, probably became aware that it wasn\'t normal back when I was 16 or so, maybe younger. \n\nThen there\'s this other pain that has me questioning my diagnosis of fibro. \n\nSee, I know that fibromyalgia is not progressive... but I have a pain symptom that is getting more frequent with time. \n\nThis pain is centered on my arms. I previously thought it was just my hands, but now I\'ve noticed (or it changed) that it goes up to my forearms as well. \n\nThis pain is extremely difficult to explain. All I could really describe is that it feels like my joints are extremely ""dry"", resulting in any movement causing deep sharp and radiating pain that lasts. \n\nI\'ve found that heat helps, so I bought myself some heated gloves and wear them when I have the pain, but overall it incapacitates me for 12-24 hours until it dissipates. \n\nIt usually starts early evening and keeps me up through the night, and fades by the next evening. \n\nRecently I\'ve noticed that I have an extremely tight knot in my forearm muscle as well, and my last time I experienced this pain I tried to massage it... it helped in the *moment* of massage, but the second I stopped the pain was back in force. All I managed to do was trigger my originally mentioned pain, which is finally fading now, a week later. \n\nI feel like the occurances of these ""spasms"" is getting more and more frequent. \n\nThere was a time I would have only one a year, but this month I had two in one week. \n\nThere\'s no predicting when this will happen. Initially I thought it was exertion related, but since then I\'ve noticed that there is no pattern. I only know that it\'s coming when it starts hurting. \n\nI think this kind of pain started around age 18? And it\'s been increasing in frequency almost exponentially. \n\nAnyway, I\'d appreciate any help, and I greatly thank you for reading this all. \n\nIs it fibro???

Ive been dealing with persistent dermatitis underneath my eyes that wasnt responding to treatment. We tried topical antibiotic, oral antibiotic and I did what I could to figure out what my triggers were in my environment all to no avail (**switched toothpastes, detergent, stopped wearing makeup, tried eczema creams, tried putting nothing on it, bought air purifier etc etc etc**) I went to my dermatologist and my eye doctor who couldnt agree on what was going on. \n\nAnyways, after about 3 months of continuous flare ups that were getting worse and worse- I finally tried protopic. Within 3 days of using it the flare up is almost completely gone. \n\nMy dermatologist explained to me that there isnt much risk associated with tacromilus and that the black box warning isnt really relevant to topical tacromilus. He said I can really use it as I need for however long I need. I asked him about it suppressing my immune system and he said I dont need to worry about that- I can get vaccines as needed and everything. \n\nIm happy the tacromilus is working- but I am a little concerned about blindly trusting my dermatologist about the long term safety of the product. Especially since it is an immunosuppressant.. Im worried that maybe its not safe to  not let my body express itself to a potential reaction in my environment. And that I can potentially experience problems in another form later on.  \n\nI also used a topical steroid for a few weeks and Im wondering if thats also why the Tacrolimus took it away- as maybe I was experiencing prolonged flare ups bc I used the steroid in the past? Anyways I know there isnt a definitive way to tell right now - Im just looking for some advice and perspective regarding my situation. This is my first time dealing with eczema so its all very overwhelming. I also have a little anxiety about its putting a bandaid on things when it comes to health.\n\nTLDR: **Are there long term side effects to pro topic? Will my rash return as soon as I stop taking it?

oxycontin,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/rgzqqh/a_bit_of_a_positive_one/,b'a bit of a positive one.',,"b""So... I am a guy that suffers from depression a lot. I get really lost within my head about a lot of stuff that has happened in my past and I've dealt with suicidal thoughts quiet a fair bit. As well as having depression, when I'm at my lowest, I get a lot of paranoid thoughts and anxiety because of this. I wouldn't really say that I have anxiety or paranoia, but they are definitely products of what my mental state can morph into. I haven't worked in 3 years because of this. And in my depression, it lead me to substance abuse, with amphetamines, benzos, opiates like Xanax, oxycontin, MDMA and other things.\n\nI manged to pull myself out of taking Xanax and Oxycontin by going completely cold turkey and it was fucking abysmal with all the withdrawals from that. But I knew I had to stop because this was killing my family deep down and the remainder of my friends that I had at the time, but mostly it was killing me. I nearly lost my flat which could've made me homeless (also to add after I got kicked out of my mothers for being aggressive on these drugs) and I felt like I had no one. the only thing I really had was music to get me through stuff that wasn't doing damage towards me.\n\nAnyway, I got off the Xanax and Oxy's and went through the withdrawals and that stopped and I felt free. I still do a little bit of MDMA here and there but not as much as I used to, but I'm working on that. And recently I've been perusing my music career a bit more than I have in the past and I've been doing quiet well with it. I played my first ever show last night with 10 of the most talented artists in the north east for Shoshin Noels fundraiser. And all I can say is that it couldn't have went better.\n\nI manged to get myself involved in a scene with some amazing people and I couldn't be more grateful for it. everyone was getting lit, moshing about and just being so supportive and encouraging to go the distance. I owned my set and had my friends and others shouting my lyrics, some of which are very personal, and I couldn't be any more proud of myself than I am right now.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that you can do anything you put your mind and soul to. I want this post to help encourage people into doing something they love and owning it. this post is not to flex about what I've done at all. I see a lot of people in this subreddit suffering, and I do to still suffer. I know this wont be he end of the dark days, but I can for sure tell you I kicked anxiety and depression in the nuts last night. And if I can do it, you all can.\n\nStrive for what you believe in, take those steps to becoming what you envisioned yourself doing, whether that be small or big, it doesn't matter, its progress towards a better life.\n\nthe demons will always be around and life can be a bitch and a shithole, but make life your bitch. \n\nI hope this has helped and to who ever reads this... you've got this! you are worth it.\n\nLove to all of you!"""

All testing has been negative and shows that I am in good health.\n\nI have been and continue to be under the care of doctors but have yet to receive a diagnosis.  A possible clot, Superficial Thrombophleblitis, CIDP, self diagnosed CRPS have all been mentioned but I think all are ruled out at this point.  Honestly, I really need help/ideas as I am in pain every day and more and more symptoms seem to be showing up.\n\n45 male 5\'8ish"" 166 lbs caucasion, midwest state.  I have been on various drugs since I was 20 for high blood pressure.  Been taking 5 mg and 10 mg Lisinipril for over 10 years.  It has seemed to mostly keep my blood pressure at around 120 over 80.\n\nI have no known family history of Multiple Sclerosis.\n\nFully vaccinated...for everything including Covid.\n\nI ran cross country and track in high school and college.  My running continued into my late twenties...but I mostly switched to another sport (which involves a lot of running).  Before all this happened, I considered myself to be active and agile and strong.  I worked out regularly.  I have worked occasionally as a gardener for the past several years.\n\nMy diet is probably higher than normal for dairy products and I probably eat a lot of flour as I like to make sourdough bread and other baking products often.  The one thing that is high in my blood tests were my cholesterol numbers...probably because my family likes whole milk, cheese, and yogurt so much.  My doctor was not concerned about that though.\n\nI injured myself in early 2021 doing a box jump.  Missed it. Landed on my shins.  Gouged a chunk of skin out of my right shin.  Still have a scar.  On my left shin, I got a big deep bruise.  I thought I healed up fine from this injury.\n\nGot Covid on August 1st.  About three days into that I woke up from a nap.  Was about to get up when my left shin felt started having a burning searing, spasmy pain.  I realized later that this was exactly across from my scar on my right leg.  The pain is above a 7 when it starts...but usually settles down to an ache and then sometimes goes away.  Sometimes it just aches and aches.  So, went to urgent care clinic.  They took an ultrasound to rule out a blood clot/DVT.   They said they found some wall thickening.  Diagnosed me with a chronic pain condition called Superficial Thromboplebitis. Prescribed me to take Paxlovid and an over the counter NSAID. \n\nThings that set off the pain: If I got out of a cold shower into hot air or came from air conditioning into a hot car.  That would really set it off.  Also kneeling on my knee would set off the ache and if I was not careful, would probably set off the high level pain.\n\nAnyways, I took the Paxlovid and one expired Aleve and the pain ceased pretty much immediately.  I almost forgot about it.\n\nOn October 13th, I had just finished walking a half mile in the morning, when the pain/ache returned.  I was a few days into a cold.  I got another Ultrasound, showed nothing.  Still no other symptoms.  But after this appointment I noticed some tenderness down the inside of my right leg.  I also had a poison ivy-like skin reaction to the gel that they used during the Ultrasound.  As a gardener, I often get Poison Ivy, so I keep a Prednisone taper prescription on hand. I used it here. I believe it worked stopping my allergic reaction for the rash.  I do not believe the rash was related to whatever else is bothering me, however, taking Prednisone may have affected it.  Using this steroid may have been the reason why the pain settled down for awhile.\n\nThe pain mostly was manageable for awhile, but became high level again on about November 4th.  This is when I finally got to see a better doctor.  He ordered several blood tests and an EMG.  Also referred me to see a specialist for Long Term Covid and also a spine doctor.  Told me to start taking 1800 mg Ibuprofen a day.  The blood tests showed that I was normal or negative for just about everything. \n\nAfter that November 4th appointment, I had more symptoms appear. Basically I got a bunch of spots in my calves and shins and especially on the insides of my lower legs including my ankles that felt like the muscle was catching or pinching. Stretching did not help. This bothered me so much that I could barely walk. I believe the Ibuprofen dosage eventually allowed the symptoms to pass.almost completely. \n\nI also got my last Covid booster shortly after this appointment.\n\nSo, with no symptoms, that is when I got the EMG, saw the covid and spine doctors.  EMG said that my nerves were functioning appropriately.  Covid specialist said that I did not check off enough of the Covid boxes to be considered having Long Term Covid. Spine doctor indicated that my pain did not radiate down the nerves from my back, so a cause coming from my back was unlikely. He did say that I should get an MRIso I am working on that.\n\nThe Covid person told me to not take so much Ibuprofen. So, I started taking Aleve and Aleve PM instead. The Aleve PM kinda sort helps me sleep through the pain.\n\nI am also requesting a test for Lyme Disease and Hypothyroidismbecause they both can cause Peripheral Neuropathy.\n\nBasically, my one painful spot comes and goes. And I have a variety of other symptoms. Mostly I just feel various spots in my body. They just feel weird. In my right calf and shin. And especially in my left forearm. My right forearm and wrist. In my left lower back. Other symptoms are that I woke up yesterday to the tips of my fingers being numb. I was able to shake them and get feeling back. I have had a slight head ache occasionally. \n\nBecause of my one painful spot, I can only limp around. I have rarely left my house in the last three weeks. It is really hard to work out when you cant use one of your legs, so I have not worked out in quite a while.\n\nOne other symptom is that my temperature seems consistently low. 97.2 is common. Once, I measured 96.6 at the doctors office. And my feet and ankles are almost always cold to the touch of my hands. I have been wearing a ton of clothes and hat lately and being buried underneath blankets at nightway more than I used to. I know it is recently winterbut my body just does not seem to generate much heat. I used to wake up in the morning in a cocoon of heatand now it seems like there is no heat when I wake up.\n\nFeel free to ask me questions.'"

I started taking Celexa and going to counseling regularly. \n\nEventually during these counseling sessions and as a result of many of my questionable life choices, it was discovered that I also have a codiagnosis of alcoholism/addiction.

Being a new dentist was stressful enough, but attempting to help people who cannot take care of themselves physically/mentally/financially/etc was incredibly anxiety inducing for me. I decided that I needed to make a change.\n\nI started a new associateship this December working in a private practice. Prior to December, this was a solo practice for 30 years with plenty of extremely loyal patients. Now that the owner doc wants to only work part time, I'm there to pick up the slack. I was hopeful that my anxiety would diminish with the new setting/clientele, but as of writing this I realize I may be very wrong. The pressure of delivering dental care and meeting the expectations of these patients loyal to the owner doc has me on edge every time I step into an operatory/hygiene room. My anxiety is just as bad if not worse than before.\n\nI question whether I was truly passionate about dentistry or whether I was seeking external validation or compensating for what I felt were shortcomings in my social/family/personal life. None of my colleagues/friends never knew the true realities of any of my anxieties/addictions. I have always been able to hide these things fairly well and kept them internalized for longer than I should have.\n\nMy gut feeling is that even with the medications/counseling/support groups/practice I am not mentally/emotionally healthy enough to be a dentist and that I should pursue an alternative dental career (possibly in teaching pre-clinic at a dental school or something along those lines). The other side of me is telling me that I'm being weak/fearful and I need to just stick it out and eventually these feelings with diminish if not disappear. I'm skeptical though as I have talked with several dentists who are also in recovery that still question their career choice after 10-15 years of practice.\n\nAny insight/advice would be appreciated. Not looking for a definitive answer necessarily, but I do feel like I need a reality check. Thanks."""

antimicrobial,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/vh3v6j/multiple_root_canals_failed/,b'multiple root canals failed',,"b""I'm wondering if I have some underlying problem that causes my root canals to fail.\n\nI had a root canal done by a dentist on tooth #21 1.5 years ago and since that time that tooth was giving me pain.  I went to multiple doctors to get opinions, they took X-rays and CBCT scan but could not find anything.  At some point the pain lessened but after 2-3 months returned even worse.  I went to an endodontist who suggested to redo the root canal.  They also took another CBCT scan.  The root canal was redone but the pain didn't stop, it was getting a bit better and then worse but no overall progress.  After 2-3 months i decided to have this tooth pulled.  Oral surgeon who pulled the tooth said I had an infection under the tooth, which was a cause of this pain.  The tooth apparently was not cracked.  I thought that redoing root canal would take care of the infection, but according to them, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nAnyway, long story short, in 3-4 months after this I ended up needing another root canal on tooth #20.  This time I went to another endodontist to do it.  Unfortunately, after 2-3 days that tooth started hurting again.  The pain got worse.  They agreed to undo the root canal and put antimicrobial medication into the canal to see if this will help.  That procedure did not seem to help.  The other thing they did was to give me antibiotics.  I tried several ones, Amoxicillin, Augmentin and Erithromycin which didn't do anything.  The one that did help was Clindamycin, as I felt much better after couple of days.  The pain never really went away completely, but it was minimal for couple of months however then it returned.  The nature of the pain was very similar to what i had for #21, but not as strong though.  The endodontist said there is nothing more can be done about it and suggested for me to get extraction and implant.  This time i decided not to wait a year like i did for #21 and got tooth #20 extracted several days ago.  They also let me take the tooth home, i examined it but didn't find any cracks.\n\nMy question is that what could be going on.  Do i have some persistent infection that causes all my root canals to fail?  I m afraid of the same thing repeating if i need another root canal.  I'm planning to get an implant (or 2) to replace the missing teeth, but also concerned if an implant can fail too for the same reason (infection).  According to the doctor, it is possible the infection was anaerobic, since treating with Clindamycin worked for a while.  However since this also ultimately didn't fix the problem, something else is required.  The root canals were done and redone by different endodontists so it's hard to believe that both did a bad job.  This is a mystery for me.  I asked oral surgeon if they can take a bacterial culture to determine precisely what antibiotic i need, so far they said they normally don't do this kind of thing, but perhaps i need to ask again.\n\nAlso, I had several root canals done in the past, about 20 years ago, and there was no such problem.  Any ideas?"""

Such strange sensations feeling the tools scrape against the bone and feel the packing of material.

I ceased the medication and made sure with my doctor to not continue its usage.

I was experiencing tremors at this time in my hands, as well as the muscle twitching. ECHO heart test came out normal, cardiologist sent me home saying to intake more sodium in my diet. At this point it\'s safe to assume it\'s not a heart issue but maybe a brain issue. I talked to my neurologist about the Ivermectin and how it may be causing my muscle spasms.

He also referred me for an MRI which is upcoming.\nDay 10/11 is when I started experiencing a pressure on the left side of my head. It feels like a giant bug is clinged onto my scalp. It is not painful, just very uncomfortable. I also experience arbitrary itching over my body that last a few minutes and goes away. Sometimes pimple-like bumps will form and disappear along with the itching. \nDay 12 new symptom of abrupt noise startling my entire body. Hard to explain but if you research hyperacusis (which is something I\'ve had for years) it is like that except not confined to only my ear. Began experiencing shortness of breath this night, numbness in legs. Very rapid eye twitching when eyes were closed (could not sleep because of this). A feeling like I was going to pass out and never wake up. The shaking this night was the worst it has ever been. All of this was accompanied by extreme nausea. I went to the ER this night. ER checked my blood sugar which was around 144. Blood pressure was normal. Urine was normal. I had another EKG done which came out to be normal. Once I saw the doctor I told him that I believe all of this is caused from the Ivermectin and its effect on my brain and he dismissed it as unlikely. He had me do a chest x-ray which was normal. I was pretty aggravated as I didn\'t believe I had any issues with my heart, but my brain. Went home with a stomach full of anti-nausea medicine and that\'s it.\nNext few days were same old symptoms. Day 15 I experienced something similar to the night I needed to go to the hospital,  but not as severe. Day 20, which was last night, got the feeling again. Realized that it worsens when I sit or lay down, so I kept myself pacing around the house last night. Was able to fall asleep but I woke up many times to distorted vision, almost like vertigo.\nAnyway, you get the idea. Now I\'m up to today. So far I feel pretty food compared to other days, just an uncomfortable numbness in my head. I feel like the muscle twitching has died down over the days but still occurs. The Ivermectin has been out of my system since the twitching started, I never took it again after that. But the effects have seemed to not go away. I\'m wondering, if it\'s been out of my system for so long, how could it still be causing new symptoms to occur? Or could it have just been a coincidence that these symptoms started concurrently while taking Ivermectin, and it\'s something else not related to the drug?\n\nTl;dr: took pills, made me twitch, stopped taking pills, still twitching and experiencing new symptoms almost 3 weeks later. Could pills cause continual and worsening neurological damage even after halting their use? Or is it something else?\n\nFor anyone that read this: thank you. This is really hard for me to deal with, considering it most likely involves my central nervous system.\nOther information: 20 y/o female. no known allergies/genetic family disorders. currently not on any medication. been dealing with an undiagnosed ear dysfunction since around 16 (hyperacusis, tinnitus, ear pressure, occasional dizziness). ENTS could not figure out what it is. Had MRI last year and it came out normal. Started experiencing derealization/depersonalization in February of this year and has also been happening with this ongoing issue.'"

Earlier, when it all happened, I  was convinced I was choking because it didn't feel right to swallow without chewing, so I started to cough to try and get it out and I don't think it came out.

Diverticulosis and possible IBS.\n\nGood afternoon, doctors!\n\nI have been recently struggling with an odd pain sensation in twitching throughout my body. \n\nA few months ago, I noticed a popping in my ears with significant ear pain that let me to go to an urgent care, as I thought it was just an ear infection. Unfortunately, it wasnt an ear infection but they couldnt find any evidence of anything that was wrong, so they gave me general pain medicine and told me to follow up with a primary care provider. This was accompanied by some swollen lymph nodes on the side of my neck, as well as behind my ear. \n\nI followed up with my primary care provider, and she gave me an entire blood panel, and some of my numbers were high, but she was not concerned and suggested that it could be indicative of a viral or bacterial infection that my body was fighting that I wasnt aware of, which is what was causing the lymph node issue. Eventually, the ear pain went away but she did refer me to an ENT. The ENT performed a pressure test as well as a hearing test, and just a general examination of my ears, and could not find anything that was wrong with them, and sent me to come back in six weeks. I came back after six weeks and she diagnosed me with TMJ with a prominent clicking in my left jaw (which was on the left side where the popping and pain from my ear was). The popping of my jaw is pretty loud and my jaw moves to the side when I open it wide, and the popping of the ears and pain has begun to refer to the right side as well. \n\nLiterally two days after I had that follow up with the ENT, I started getting a weird tongue root pain at the base of my tongue that made it difficult for me to talk. It felt like I was having some weird tongue strain that caused the soft palate on the roof of my mouth to hurt, as well as some general discomfort throughout my face and mouth. I return to an urgent clinic to where the doctor suggested that it could be related to my TMJ and to invest in a mouthguard and gave me some muscle relaxers (cyclobenzaprine 5-10mg a day as needed). I stopped taking the muscle relaxer when the pain from my tongue went away, as I was starting to have side effects that were not comfortable to me (head racing, anxiousness, insomnia, etc). \n\nRight after taking the medicine for the first time, I begin to notice my left ring finger and pinky finger to become intermittently numb. This is sort of a come and go thing, and eventually went away, but it came back and got so intensely store. The entire hand and arm started to feel sore, like a nerve is pinched, and it causes a burning sensation, as well as general tingling and numbness throughout my entire arm and hand. this started on the left side, and then seemingly began to move to the right all the while Im having twitching throughout my entire body, namely, my tongue, and face and legs as well. I also suffered from extreme anxiety, so I think the anxiety from the situation was causing a lot of my twitching.\n\nI visited a doctor yesterday and he took an x-ray of my head and neck region, and noticed that my spine (C5-C8) was straight instead of curved and suggested to me that this is likely the root of my issue and to fix my posture and visit a chiropractor for alignment and to do some general PT at home with a denneroll and other PT workouts. He told me to start there and if it doesnt resolve to seek other options.\n\nThe pain from my tongue comes and goes, but the discomfort on both of my arms is consistent and aggravates after doing tasks, like folding laundry, or bending down to pick something up. Its like a numbness/soreness/zapping/pins/needles/shaky feeling. Im just really concerned that theres something more sinister wrong with me, or is it truly possible that the straightness of my spine is to cause for the majority of these issues, including my TMJ, and my anxiety is just aggravating them?\n\nThanks for your advice and counsel.'"

Side note: i understand maybe i got off Celexa a bit quickly but i just followed orders. I\'ve been off now for about three weeks. \n\nRecently I\'ve also been really fatigued, though this may be more connected to coming off meds.  The feeling of fatigue is pretty gone now. \n\nAlso noticed issues with serious brain fog in the middle of a convo or trying  to come up w simple words. Also noticed a stutter when speaking. I never had a stutter growing up. \n\nI am hoping to get some verbiage or just a proper name for this feeling before going to my doc with this hard to describe experience.  \n\n FWIW the [first part of this tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRcfapPC/)is kinda like the experience I\'m feeling.

Got my vaccines, my hearing is good, and so are my eyes and height. Then came the weight. Now a little background on me and my family, were very thin. For example, when my mom moved to America from Fiji at the age of 20, she was 85.4 pounds, when the average weight of a 20 year old 54 female is about 170 pounds. My dad is also thin, when he moved to America, he was 135 pounds, when the average for a 20 year old male is 197 pounds. As a result of genetics, I too gained the very fast metabolic rates and have always been on the thin spectrum, always about 10 pounds short of the average person at my age. Ive always felt insecure about this because most of the people in my family, including my parents, are much more heavier now that their age has slowed down their metabolic rates, and also because my father skinny shamed me every time he had the chance, either in a harmless joke or in a huge sit down where he berated me for my weight, saying things like look at yourself, do you see what you look like and I can count your ribs. My mother however knows well that skinny runs in our family and constantly reassured me that Ill put on weight soon, just as soon as I hit 20 since thats when our family typically started to put on weight. I am a huge eater, usually having a big breakfast, followed by some snacks, lunch, more snacks, dinner, and then some desserts. But again back to my weight, my doctor weighed me and I was 92.5 pounds. My doctor said that its a tiny bit concerning but nothing a healthier diet could fix, so I felt a little more at ease. Then came the moment I got home. My father sat me down, telling me that he needs to talk about some stuff, and proceeds to again go after my weight, saying things like youre fucking yourself up and are you a child? Do I have to monitor what you eat? In the end, he told me that hes now going to weigh me everyday until I show a growth in weight. Hes also been adding way too much food to my plate and has been forcing me to eat it till the point where I feel sick, even though my doctor said WITH HIM IN THE ROOM that dont stuff yourself to the point where youre uncomfortable because from what youve told me you have a good meal schedule, we just now have to add the healthy bits to your meals so you can put on some weight. After that whole conversation with my father, Ive been feeling very depressed, not wanting to talk to him, and more over just staying in my room all day, only coming out to eat. As I said before, my father has skinny shamed me a lot in my childhood so Im used to it, never really affected me much. But it just feels worse than before. Now whenever he talks to me, its either did you eat, what did you eat, or you need to eat more. I feel like a damn experiment or like a lab rat, that just constantly goes through all sorts of tests.

This free radical then has the ability to produce other ROS, such as peroxides, resulting in oxidative damage that may include lipid peroxidation and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. The skin is especially susceptible to resultant oxidative damage, as it is chronically exposed to ROS-induced oxidative stress that is generated both from endogenous (inside the body) and exogenous sources (outside the body).""\n\n<snip> ""Endogenous sources of ROS in the skin include auto-oxidation and enzymatic oxidation.""\n\n<snip> In addition to endogenous sources, photooxidation and pollutant/environmental oxidants also contribute to the pathogenesis of acne via the production of ROS.

Lipid peroxidation of fatty acids and unsaturated triterpenes, such as squalene, generates both intracellular and extracellular ROS. The generation of ROS can alter the viscosity and composition of sebum.5,14 In fact, the excessive sebum production in acne is expected to promote the generation of excess ROS, leading to oxidative stress within the follicle, thus overwhelming the antioxidant system of the skin.5,14""\n\nThe article goes on to explain how the domino effect then happens to other areas of the skin, resulting in scarring, follicle impaction etc and recommends research into the use of topical anti-oxidants.\n\nHappy to chat about this with people as this is my area of expertise, and suggest some anti-oxidant therapies.'"

Former menthol cigarette smoker, I quit 4 months ago but I do vape elf bars, usually 2 per week total. No drugs or drinking. I have a fairly physical job as well, getting 10-12,000 steps a day before the gym. \n\nCurrently: I have had mild chest pain for almost 2 weeks. Its usually right when I wake up, and tends to go away as I get ready for work. The past couple of days its been going on all day, though, so I havent been going to the gym. I went to a clinic a few days ago for a checkup (dont have a lot of money, literally have 55 in my account right now) and they said my heart sounded fine, that it was likely anxiety. \n\nThis isnt the first time Ive seen a doctor for chest pain and been told its anxiety related. I went to the ER in December of 2021 for chest pain, nausea and shortness of breath to be told it was anxiety. They did a CT scan and checked my right leg (I was 350 pounds at this time, and a pack a day smoker, they did an ultrasound on my leg for DVT, both came back perfectly fine). And in April 2022 I went to urgent care, same thing, chest pain, high blood pressure, nausea, and told it was a panic attack. They simply did an EKG at this visit. \n\nI have a portable/pocket EKG I bought on Amazon, as well as a blood pressure cuff. I take my readings when I feel this pain, the EKG said no abnormalities, and my blood pressure was 110/68. \n\nI just cant help but feel like something is wrong. When I went to the ER and urgent care I felt like a total burden and that I wasted their time. After figuring out I wasnt having a heart attack they just said youre having a panic attack and sent me on my way. Im not experiencing panic symptoms. My heart isnt racing. Im not having shortness of breath at the moment. But my chest hurts. And that scares me a little. Ive seen my primary care provider after both the ER and urgent care visits and she insists its anxiety. Ive also called her office/messaged her recently about the chest pain and again, she says its my anxiety and I should try to do some therapy to ease it. \n\nWhat do I do?\n\nETA: at the clinic they did a standard blood draw for my yearly checkup and ran a variety of blood tests, thyroid, diabetes, cbc etc. Ill be happy to post those results in the comments if needed. One thing that stood out to me is that the doctor said the blood tests would tell me if I had done any damage to my heart or veins because of the high blood pressure. Every time they called me back I was at work, and due to the nature of the clinic I cant call back and speak with someone about the results. Theyve uploaded the numbers to my chart, and while I can see them, I dont know if theres damage done.'"

I'm very worried it was neurotoxicity due to a psych med I took. It could also have been COVID. I appreciate any advice.""",,"b'In June 2020, I quit my 30mg dosage of Lexapro, that I had taken since 2016, cold turkey, due to a few things.\n\n1. I was constantly anxious and OCD, and Lexapro wasn\'t helping at all. I probably had built up a very strong tolerance to it.\n2. My APRN prescriber (not my primary care doctor or a psychiatrist) was a hassle to deal with and not a very nice person. She was a good person to deal with at first, but later on became less interested in me, and seemed indifferent to my declining mental state. She also upped my dosage of Lexapro to 30mg over time, for reasons I cannot remember. In 2020, just before the cold turkey, I had suggested to her that I possibly switch to another medication, as I thought Lexapro wasn\'t working anymore, and she refused to change me to something else.\n3. The APRN moved to Texas in 2015. She never suggested seeing somebody locally after they moved. They are not licensed in Texas,only RI, CT, and WA. Texas law says they need to work with a physician to practice psych med management,but they are not licensed in Texas,they only live there, so I\'m not sure legally what they are required to do. I live in Rhode Island, and I could only get a refill through telehealth webcam visits, and my webcam didn\'t work for the session in June, meaning they refused to give me a refill, and didn\'t suggest other ways to get one.\n\nI started taking over the counter 5-HTP as a replacement for the Lexapro, but it had no effect either. Nothing was helping my anxiety at all last year. It came to a head in late September 2020, after being at the ER for an intense panic attack that spanned 3 days,until I was able to cool down at the ER. A mental health social worker had been to my house during the breakdown, but referred me to a mental health facility that wasn\'t taking any new patients, rendering that service useless, in a time when I was having an intense breakdown of emotions. The last time this had happened was in 2012, which led to my OCD/Anxiety diagnosis.\n\nI re-contacted the APRN, as they were a person who knew my case, as I had seen them for 6 years by then, and were able to see me very soon after this breakdown, and she put back on Lexapro, but at a 10mg dosage this time, instead of 30mg. They didn\'t seem concerned about me quitting 30mg cold turkey, the fact that I had quit in general so harshly, the fact that EMTs/Police had been to the house because of my breakdown, no real concern. She also did not want me to run any health tests before putting me back on medication, nor did she ask if I was taking any supplements or other medications.\n\nAbout 2 to 3 weeks into this reinstatement, I remember feeling a very heavy, dull, numb-like feeling in my head that built up over a few days, mainly at the top of my head, but it felt like it was inside my brain too. I began having jaw stiffness during the day (Not really bruxism, because it wasn\'t clenching, my jaw would just sort of jut out unconsciously), and then I started getting acute and severe health symptoms one on top of another. I had to stop taking Lexapro again due to these problems, as I thought at the time the reinstatement was causing this. I have not been on Lexapro, or any psych med in general, since mid-October 2020. The symptoms I can recall having occur suddenly from mid October 2020 to now are;\n\n1. Brain fog\n2. Memory loss\n3. Throbbing headaches\n4. Muscle twitching (Used to be very intense, mainly in my legs and stomach, but now it\'s small little twitching in my hands, face, and feet, sometimes)\n5. Bad cough\n6. Dry mouth (Only in times when I was anxious, though)\n7. Extremely dry, throbbing lips (Not sure if anxiety caused this, but for about 4 days my lips were in intense pain while that happened),\n8. Extreme fatigue\n9. Watery mucus\n10. Dry sinuses\n11. Nerve and muscle problems (Mainly in the left side of my face, neck, chest, genitals, and seldom in my left foot, in the sole area. My neck feels painful and stiff a lot on the left side, I would get quick, almost zap-like chest pains on both sides of my chest a few months ago, but now it\'s only on the left side, my face on the left side will sometimes feel tingly, burning, or weak, or numb, my genitals only hurt in the left testicle and on the left side of my penis when I move it a certain way. The right side of my leg feels weak at times too. My left foot would have a burning feeling sometimes)\n12. An intense bout of facial warmness (One day my entire face felt like it was on fire, I had an ice pack on it all night)\n13. Ear ringing (Either side multiple times a day)\n14. Nausea\n15. Pale lips\n16. An iron deficiency\n17. Numb emotions and numb libido\n18. Breathing problems (Sometimes I have to manually breathe instead of automatically, and my breathing can get labored and shallow)\n19. Blood in my mucus/phlegm\n\nSome of these symptoms have improved (Ear ringing is basically gone now, sometimes happens but not as badly, same with the bad cough), and some haven\'t (Brain fog, memory loss, numb emotions/libido, and nerve/muscle problems are a constant that rarely improves).\n\nOver a year later, I am still not really sure what caused this. Some have suggested it is long COVID, some have said that the Lexapro reinstatement might have caused a ""kindling"" adverse effect in my brain/nervous system, similar to neurotoxicity, since I had gone off 30mg cold turkey which made my brain over-sensitive to the medication the second time around, and some suggest it\'s intense stress.It could be a mix of things.\n\nMy brain CT scan in January 2021, about 3 months after this started, said ""There is mild volume loss for age, more so on the right. There may be a small area of anterolateral right frontal encephalomalacia."" and ""Mucosal thickening is seen inferiorly in the right frontal sinus as well as throughout right ethmoid air cells. The right sphenoid sinus is partially opacified. Mild mucosal thickening is seen in the left sphenoid sinus."". Everything else in the CT scan was normal.\n\nMy first brain MRI, done in February 2021, said ""Partially empty sella turcica with mild CSF prominence at the optic nerves bilaterally, can be seen in the setting of idiopathic intracranial hypertension."" and besides that, was normal. No mention of encephalomalacia, sinus issues, or volume loss whatsoever.\n\nMy second brain MRI, done in November 2021, said the same as the MRI above, but now also said ""Scattered FLAIR hyperintensities nonspecific but most commonly related to chronic microvascular changes."". Again, no mention of encephalomalacia, sinus issues, or volume loss whatsoever.\n\nX-rays done by a chiropractor of my lower back and neck done in November 2021 show a tilted pelvis, and issues with the vertebraein my neck. Can\'t remember specifics, need to find the results they mailed me again.\n\nA CT scan of my sinuses in October 2021 by an ENT doctor showed this.\n\n>FINDINGS:  \nFrontal: Moderate mucosal thickening in caudal right frontal sinus. Clear left frontal sinus.  \nEthmoid: Mild mucosal thickening throughout right ethmoid air cells. Minor posterior left ethmoid mucosal thickening.  \nMaxillary: Tiny retention cyst along floor of right maxillary sinus with additional tiny focus anteromedially. Clear left maxillary sinus. Clear ostiomeatal units.  \nSphenoid: Moderate mucosal thickening bilaterally, more so inferiorly.  \nNasal cavity: Mild nasal septal deviation to the right superiorly with slight deviation to the left inferiorly.  \nTympanomastoid: Clear. Narrowed porus acusticus bilaterally, more so on the left. Osseous thinning along superior margin of both superior semicircular canals.  \nOrbits: Unremarkable.  \nIntracranial: Grossly unremarkable.  \nIMPRESSION:  \nDiffuse overall mild paranasal sinus disease.\n\nMy blood work has also been consistently been somewhat off, with high platelet levels, anisocytosis, low MCH, high WBC levels, high RBC, high monocytes count, high neutrophils count, high lymphocytes count, high atypical lymphocytes, high ANC, high RDW-CV, high glucose, and low iron levels showing up repeatedly in blood work done from November 2020 to October 2021. I also have giant platelets.\n\nI am wondering if the people on here can offer any advice. It\'s been awful at times dealing with these issues, and not knowing why it happened, and why it\'s not going fully away, for over a year, is so frustrating. If people here have any questions, please feel free to ask. The most helpful person I\'ve seen IRL was my hematologist, who believes me, but thinks it is some sort of infection/inflammation issue going on, as opposed to an SSRI-related health incident.'"

Is this true, and is it bad that my doctor told me to take it for 3 weeks twice a day? Also, she did say if it didnt work wed move on to shockwave therapy and one pill a day of celebrex, so that would make it even longer on anti inflammatory pills, plus I have no clue what shockwave therapy is or whether its safe and common or not.

Tolerance develops by the day\n2. , so after a week, you woul need at least 3 times the initial dose. \n3. By the end of week two, you are most likely an addict. Wave goodbye to joy.\n4. It requires a prescription and doctors across the globe are calling to ban the stuff\n5. In 30 years, trying hundreds of different substances, it's the only one I advise to skip.\n6.

influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/ndlsno/moderna_shot_2_on_accutane/,b'Moderna Shot #2 on Accutane',,"b""I left a post after I received my 1st Moderna shot to help others on accutane. Again, I'll restate as with my first post, the choice belongs to the individual. This is not to persuade or dissuade getting the vaccine or not. For my situation, the choice was to receive the vaccine. I'm not posting this as medical advice just for an anecdotal account.\n\nHere is some context and my experience: I've been on 20mg of accutane for 6 months. I received my 2nd Moderna shot Friday around 7:45a.m. My arm started hurting a few hours later but not as much as the 1st shot. While the arm pain started sooner with the 2nd shot, it was not as intense as the 1st. Around 7p.m. I felt tired but that is not unusual or unique. I woke up a few times in the night, most notably at 2a.m. I had chills and a headache with some nausea. While it was uncomfortable it wasn't unmanageable. I drank some more water and tried to distract myself by reading for a bit until falling back asleep. The next day I laid low. The headache lingered, it was a dull, aching sensation. The chills subsided by morning. Day 2 on Sunday, feeling much better. The only thing I've noticed is I haven't been very hungry since. \n\nI think what helped in my experience was remaining cognizant of staying hydrated BEFORE and AFTER the shot. Also, I completely surrendered and took it easy. I didn't try to overdo it. I moved my arm around every so often. It's a weird sensation like a bubble under the injection site (normal.) I did have side effects with the 1st shot which most do not according to the CDC. The stronger your immune system the more likely you'll have an intense reaction. This is why fewer older folks have strong reactions. Everybody is different. I expected the worst but hoped for the best.  Taking accutane and getting the vaccine, really left me wondering what my experience would be since it suppresses the immune system. I had about every listed side effect but it all felt uncomfortable more than unbearable.\n\nGood luck to all, stay healthy, and here's to wishing you clear skin!"""

I didn't listen to the dealers advice and ended up having way more then I should have. It started off slow with little to know affect, so I kept having them, until it eventually hit me like a wall, and my heart started to race. I started to panic and tried to throw up, but it didn't help much. After that didn't work, I tried drinking a bunch of water, but my heart rate kept skyrocketing. Eventually I had someone drive me to the hospital, and my memory is kinda hazy after that. The hospital also said I had barbiturates in my system, but I believe that may be caused by the fact that I consumed kratom in the past. Surprisingly after this event I seemed fine, until the next time I had smoked. During this I convinced myself that I was having a heart attack and had a similar experience except without going to the hospital. I thought I was going to die. A few days later I had the same experience without smoking weed. After that I quit smoking weed, cigarettes, and, alcohol and caffeinated drinks. But, this didn't do much, but make the panic attacks worse and I started getting paranoid about my environment. For example I would have weird thought processes and was at a point where I was half convinced my mother was trying to poison me. \nDuring this month I also began to have massive amounts of heartburn and felt sick whenever I ate food. I believe this was caused by antibiotics I took for acne. It's been three months now and I had my heart checked by a cardiologist and the panic attacks have mostly gone away, but they are still triggered by certain things. Caffeine can cause it, I had a non-alcoholic beer and that caused me to start to panic. I want to be able to have a beer sometime in the future and maybe Coffee or iced tea, without having an adrenaline rush, from thinking my hearts about to fail.\n What should I do, I had no medical treatment for panic attacks earlier, because I was too young for the normal medication. Is there a chance that it is a heart problem? Could it be a brain injury, and if so when will it eventually heal?(thanks for reading, sorry if the formatting weird its my first post, I may post this elsewhere too)"""

The pain was unbearable so I had no choice. The dentist over there started a root treatment but didnt finish, patched it and said that I should take another appointment asap, but the closest appointment being 3 months away back home. \n\nFast forward to 10 days ago, it started hurting again, I used my brain and figured out that it must be caused by some infection, luckily I had some leftover penicillin which fixed most of the pain. \n\nToday, I had an appointment, supposedly to finish the root treatment but no, I apparently had some infected abscess making it impossible to finish it now so he just drained it and sanitised my tooth. Now, idk wtf he did but the pain that came afterwards is unbearable. Ive been crying the whole day bc of the pain, Its honestly probably the worst pain Ive ever been through and its not even been 24h. The pain is reaching all the way to my ear, whole jaw and even my arm. He took scans of my tooth, everything is in order he said and that the pain would go away within 2 days but I have a hard time believing this as 20 hours later, not even amoxicillin or 5 tabs of painkillers did anything to help. If that keeps going Ill end up ruining my liver from taking painkillers, I will have to miss work and my holidays will be ruined. Not only this by Ill need a liver transplant if I keep taking this many painkillers. Im so tired of having problems with that tooth. \n\nNo amounts of paracetamol, naproxen or parcodin helps. I live in Iceland where laws regarding prescriptions are very tight so I dont even know if I could get anything stronger. \n\nShould I go to the hospital and try to get anything stronger?

Vaccinated/boosted? Didn\'t get sick? Were only sick for a day or two very mildly? Doesn\'t matter. I\'ll reference this article later: https://time.com/6186429/suicide-long-covid/\n\nMy story:\nI\'ll never actually know if I had COVID when I got sick for really just about a day in mid-December. I think it was mid-December, maybe late November, but it was there one night then gone the next. I didn\'t get the incredible fatigue and brain fog where I couldn\'t even think of a sentence or walk more than 10 feet without being out of breath until the end of January. I\'d just had my booster shot in early November, I was a healthy and energetic 38 year old guy.\n\nI wasn\'t depressed. I know what depression is like, and this was not it. I was in a new job that I had a lot of stress over (wanting to perform well!), I was changing my medications from Vyvanse to Adderall, and I\'d stopped drinking alcohol so there was a lot to maybe blame. My doctor checked for recent COVID but it would\'ve been too far in the past. He checked a bunch of other stuff.\n\nSlowly over time I got better. Except... my brain got worse inside. I wasn\'t myself anymore, I was this irrational, uncontrollable emotions, my brain wanted to kill itself in a really dispassionate way that wasn\'t depression. My anxiety went through the roof. My brain raced in a way that only the past two days have I realized was driving me insane (metaphorically, I felt entirely too rational for a person who actively wanted to die).\n\nI read the article I linked up above (https://time.com/6186429/suicide-long-covid/). I made an appointment to see a mental health nurse practitioner, but they couldn\'t get me in until July 5. I tried to hold on day to day because I wanted to die no matter what happened.\n\nI missed a family BBQ because I was getting over a cold. Really I wanted to kill myself. My wife got a bad feeling and rushed home and found me asleep in bed... but she wasn\'t wrong to be worried. So I checked myself into psychiatric urgent care.\n\nFirst off, please go to a place like this if you\'re struggling. They were the nicest and kindest people to me. I talked about what I was feeling, how it felt like an EXTERNAL me, and she described some very specific and acute symptoms that were also what I was dealing with. And then she just flat said, ""We\'re seeing this nonstop. It\'s very, very likely long-COVID.""\n\nIt wasn\'t ADHD. It wasn\'t depression. It wasn\'t JUST anxiety. It wasn\'t JUST suicidal ideation. It was (probably) inflammation responses in my brain causing me unbelievable amounts of mental pain and personality changes.\n\nI got an anti-anxiety medication and one to help me sleep/stabilize mood. The night and day difference is that I\'m actually myself and hearing my thoughts again not just a constant rush of babble. Something went really wrong in my brain and I don\'t know if it\'s ADHD + the long-COVID but... yeah.\n\nI know there are other people out there struggling and if I hadn\'t thought I had hope/a way to get better, I would\'ve died. It was unbearable to take. So please, go get help. You can\'t muscle your way out of it and your ADHD medication won\'t help.

I may have had my first full panic attack.',,"b'OK I am going to go ahead and apologize for the long wall of text you are going to get.  So I start off the day yesterday at about 5:30 am.  I get up and eat two bowls of cap\'n crunch (I know, razor blades!!!) and everything seems ok.  At 7 am I take 30 mg of Vyvanse that my doc prescribed last week on Monday for anxiety and 500 mg of nabumetone for some pain I am having in my back and legs.  Again, everything seems ok.  Day isn\'t bad.  Wife gets up and gets ready for work.  Everything is ok between my wife and I.  No problems there (that I know of) and she goes off to work.  \n\nAt about 8:30 or 9:00 am I go for a walk (about 1.5 miles) and talk to my mother (mostly just listening to her go on and on about nothing).  I get back from the walk feeling sweaty and take a quick shower.  So far I am feeling my usual anxious self and some depression but nothing really bad.  I am functional.  I am ok.  \n\nAt 10 am I take my ""morning medicine,"" which consists of 1 mg Xanax extended release, 40 mg of prilosec (for my terrible stomach acid), 800 mg of Gabapentin (again, for anxiety), and 25 mg of Seroquel (anxiety).  My day goes on.  Nothing bad happens to me.  No one yells at me.  Nothing goes wrong.  I am doing research on the internet, playing my 3DS, playing around with Blender 3D.  \n\nAt about 11:30 am I eat a bag of Reese\'s cups.  I didn\'t intend to eat as many as I did.  Probably 5 and a half servings of them.  I usually eat candy but not that much.  I am trying to cut back on sugary things because of my weight (about 210 lbs).  I think this was my obvious first mistake.  I don\'t eat anything for lunch.  Just the candy.  \n\nAt 12:30 pm I start to feel tired.  This is when I do something new.  I drank an orange flavored ""5 hour energy.""  I usually feel tired early afternoon and my doc didn\'t have any advice for me so I went this route.  My wife thought it was a good entry point for someone who doesn\'t regularly consume caffeine.  I feel ok.  I don\'t go to sleep or anything.  I don\'t feel super jacked up.  I just feel a little tired but nothing too bad.  My anxiety still isn\'t over the top or anything.  The day goes on.  I spend time with my 3DS and talking to a friend on the internet. \n\n At about 3 pm I start experiencing pain in my pectoral area.  Not sure if it is muscular or what, but whenever I moved just a little bit I would feel pain on both sides.  I also notice that I am feeling a little more jittery than usual.  Anxiety is starting to build up.  I try really hard to focus on my game.  I think maybe it is just the caffeine (again, not that much.  Less than a cup of coffee) and go on. \n\n At 4 pm I take my day time medicines (seroquel 25 mg and gabapentin 800 mg again) and keep playing my game.  The pain is getting worse.  the anxiety is getting worse.  Everything is getting worse.  I am having trouble focusing.  Having trouble concentrating.  Not feeling well.  \n\nMy wife gets home at about 5 or 5:30 pm and is super happy that she got me some xmas presents from Target for a super good deal.  Wife is in a great mood.  She seems happy.  She is being super nice to me.  For some reason, though, every word she says upsets me.  I feel like even the smallest move she makes is going to make me start yelling.  I am super irritated and aggravated.  The pain is getting worse now and it is starting to move to the center of my chest.  I tell my wife I am not feeling well.  I try to just let it go and think about something else.  My wife has me put a pizza in the oven for her.  I didn\'t put one in the oven for myself because I wasn\'t feeling well and I didn\'t know what was going on.  I keep stressing to my wife that I don\'t feel well.  I tell her that maybe I want to go to the emergency room after I think about it for a minute.  She goes, ""that bad?!"", and then doesn\'t really talk too much about it.  She does ask, ""what do you think they can do?"", which is something that has been going on in my head for a while now.  The pain is pretty intense now.  The anxiety is way high.  Every small sound and movement in the house seems like it is specifically engineered to infuriate me.  I sit down on the couch and watch Hotel Impossible with my wife.  The pain is bad.  Strong burning sensation in my chest.  I feel like maybe I am dying.  This doesn\'t feel like heart burn.  I know it can\'t be a heart attack.  I start to think that maybe I am having a panic attack.  My wife looks over and sees me in pain and checks on me.  I tell her I want to go to the emergency room.  \n\nWe end up going.  The ER is only about a mile from my house.  We get in there and it is a long wait.  I tell them I am having chest pain and I feel like I am dying.  They take my vitals and hook me up to an EKG and check on my heart.  Everything is normal except for my blood pressure.  It was a bit high, but the nurse said it was normal for someone in an agitated state like I was.  Then I wait.  I am starting to feel some discomfort in my stomach now on top of the pain in my chest.  I ask my wife to find me something to eat.  She disappears for a while and then comes back with a small bag of chips, a pack of crackers, and a bag of cheez-its.  I eat the bag of chips and some of the crackers.  After eating, I was starting to feel a little better.  The burning in my chest was starting to go away.  I wait in the emergency room for hours.  No doctor visit.  I play my 3DS for a while.  I realize that I could probably just go home now and call my doctor tomorrow. \n\n After waiting 3 hours to see the doctor, I end up leaving the ER and just going home and going to bed.  This wasn\'t heartburn.  I have had heartburn before.  That is not what this was.  I don\'t think being hungry had a causal link to all the shit I was experiencing.  I have been hungry before.  This hasn\'t happened before.  Did the panic attack pass as I was eating and calming down?  Was I suffering from low blood sugar?  High blood sugar?  Was it the 5 hour energy?  Was it the Vyvanse?  Why would I have chest pain 5 hours after drinking a 5 hour energy.  Why would I have chest pain and all these problems after I was getting near the end of the half life on my Vyvanse.  Why did I start to feel better?  What the hell happened?\n\nI am a 30 year old man diagnosed with a bunch of psych stuff.  I live in the US (if you couldn\'t tell by my measurements in the post).  My doctor told me in my last visit (monday last week) that I was going to start ECT soon.  The Vyvanse was an attempt by the doctor to at least hold me over until the ECT got started.  I hadn\'t taken a psycho stimulant before.  I am not taking any recreational or illegal drugs.  I am taking my medications exactly as prescribed by my doctor.  I do not smoke.  I do not drink alcohol.\n\nWhat happened?  Thank you for reading my insanely long post.  I apologize for the typos that you will read.  I hate proofreading.\n\nEDIT 1: Formatting to make post easier to read.  Also, I have contacted my doctor\'s office and am waiting to hear back.

I came across ashwagandha for my sports recovery. It is a super herb from india currently being hyped in the sports community. It mainly decreases your cortisol levels (stress hormone) by up to one third and I consider it highly effective. I was rather surprised how potent it was. Get the KSM-66 formula because it has consistent high quality and works without the intake of fats (some herbs need that for them to work). You have to take it a couple of days for your system to absorb it because its plant based. 1000mg a day is the recommended max. dose. I went down to 500mg because it calmed me down too much but its up to you to regulate. Your cortisol as an insomniac goes through the roof especially in the morning, i.e. when your get up and are all angry about not getting sleep and being frustrated at the same time because you think you can not cope :)\n\nPlease remember: see the intake of anything as something that gives you the opportunity to then work on your mental challenges, like insomnia. Try working with it to get your life rearranged. Don't expect your insomnia to be gone by taking in meds or this. Insomnia is just a false wiring of your cognition/subconscious/interactivity of belief and action... it is so deeply routed in your mind that you can't directly influence. You can only overcome it by becoming someone new and not paying a lot of attention to your sleep."""
lorazepam,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/yco8wq/very_strange_and_persistent_neuromuscular/,"b""Very strange and persistent neuro-muscular symptoms that doctors say is caused by 'anxiety'""",,"b"" Hello everyone - \n\nI am posting here because I feel like I'm stuck in trying to get help with some very strange and distressing neurological symptoms I've been experiencing for about nine months now. My history is quite detailed so I apologize in advance if this is a long post. I feel like I'm not getting the help I need from medical professionals and that I keep getting brushed off, so I'm wondering if anyone here could possibly put their two cents in.  \n\nBack in February I experienced my first episode. After waking up from a nap, I began experiencing some significant tremors. This eventually progressed into a six-hour episode where I experienced severe athetosis (slow, involuntary, and writhing movements) and chorea (brief, abrupt, irregular, unpredictable, non-stereotyped movements), of which I have video evidence of. This is accompanied by other symptoms such as slurred or distorted speech, confusion, moments of blanking out, excessive sweating and thirst, hypertension, shaking, and a lack of balance. I have had four significant episodes of this, and twice I went to the hospital for it. Both times the hospital gave me lorazepam to resolve the symptoms as they believed I was either on drugs (I was not) or having an anxiety attack. Both times blood and urine tests turned up nothing.\n\nMy general practitioner saw me and sent me for blood tests that originally looked for anything wrong in my blood chemistry, and then for any inflammatory markers. Absolutely nothing came up wrong. My doctor told me it looks like everything, my liver, kidneys, thyroid, etc., is in perfect condition. They also sent me to have an MRI. Nothing remarkable was seen in the results. In July I went to get an EEG, and during the strobe light test portion another episode of muscle movements was immediately triggered. Immediately after leaving the hospital, I had what my family believes was my first absence seizure (my stepfather, who's brother has experienced seizures his whole life, said this is what he believed it was), which I believe I had an aura for. Since then, there have been three other seizures where I have felt an aura of sorts come on (very prominent tingling in the left side of my body), as well as others I was not aware of until my family mentioned them to me. The other thing to mention is that since the very first episode in February, I have experienced constantly, daily ticks and twitches in my muscles. A random muscle in my body will decide to flex, sometimes gently, sometimes very forcefully. Some days are worse than others, but the worst is when I try to fall asleep at night, during which my body routinely jerks every 1-10 seconds. This never happened before the first episode. Nothing helps, either. I have tried extensive yoga and meditation before bed, medications to help me sleep, muscle relaxants, and nothing has been able to stop them.\n\nI was able to see a neurologist at the end of August. When he got my EEG results back, they said they have no evidence of a seizure disorder. Once again, the doctor defaulted to telling me that this has all been a result of anxiety. He also insinuated that since I still regularly meet with my psychologist (I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder when I was 15 and have been on medication since then, and still meet with my psychologist to keep my mental health in good shape), that must mean I still have mental issues which are causing my problems. Since then, I have been reluctant to reach out to anyone, especially any health care professionals, and have come close to just learning to live with these debilitating symptoms.\n\nSome background information on me: I am a 22-year-old woman, and I am a student in university and regularly achieve high grades and will soon be starting research in a lab. I am also a triathlete (I actually won 5th place in my most recent race) and regularly exercise and eat a good diet. I have a good social life and have good communication with those around me. Im actively in the dating pool, and I use free time to volunteer with animals in my city. I also havent had an anxiety attack in a very long time. Like I said above I do daily yoga and meditation to help wind down at the end of the day. Before this first episode, I felt as if I was living my best life, with the sole exception that I was struggling with severe, severe fatigue (as in daily, hours-long naps even after sleeping for 9 hours or more, falling asleep while walking, or over my computer, or while socializing).\n\nI have been feeling very lost, afraid, and frustrated for a long time. I'm considering just accepting that this is part of my life now, because so many doctors now have made me think I'm crazy. Nothing is getting better and no one seems to want to help. I understand that it may be easy to default to a mental issue, but even so, no one has offered a way to resolve these symptoms even if they are happened to be caused by anxiety. In any case, I was hoping to hear from the community to see what they think."""

I received antibiotics through it three times a day and had the bandages changed once a week by a professional the whole site cleaned and everything. for the last two weeks I had a bit of irritation with it and for the last two cleanings they used iodine instead of alcohol as that was what they thought the issue was (just a lot of alcohol over a long period of time). I also had to use cloth bandage instead of the adhesive for the last week as it was irritated. \n\nnothing went wrong with the removal but my arm got really bumpy, red and splotchy and like sticky afterward. that went away slowly with me just leaving it be and letting it get air. after that everything healed alright and the scar even started fading. it has gotten itchy on occasion (two or three times) but I'm pretty good about ignoring that and it's gone away within the day with no rash or visual sign of the itching.\n\nthis time has been different, a rash around it has been slowly spreading around the inner side of my upper arm where the line was and is now traveling down my arm. it's also super itchy and cotizone has been helping but only for a couple hours.

Ive tried a humidifier, lozenges and cough drops, Tylenol and ibuprofen, throat pain sprays, and hot and cold drinks, and none of these make any difference in reducing the pain.

Sorry for the long post! I, 22F no severe health issues, have been dealing with TMJ pain since November of 2019. I originally thought it was simply due to stress, by January of 2020 it got so severe I could no longer open my mouth and my diet turned to a lovely diet of liquids. I saw a regular dentist who tried a steroid pack along with cyclobenzaprine, that failed and he sent my on my way to physical therapy and a specialist. The specialist had a custom made mouth guard made for me and continued me on the cyclobenzaprine, along with diagnosing me with Disk Displacement without reduction on the left and with reduction on the right. \n\nPhysical therapy lasted for a few months and saw minimal improvement, the same with the medication and the mouth guard. We were able to increase my opening to around 25 mm, and the specialist also at that time told me that he didn't notice any of the typical signs of grinding or clenching, teeth were all in good shape, no cavities. I eventually started to degrade in condition and was later sent for a CT scan with nothing being seen out of the ordinary beside enlarged lymph nodes that on an MRI appeared to have gone back to normal. The specialist didn't know what else to do as I was at the point where I had an opening of less than 10 mm, so he sent me to an oral surgeon.\n\nThe oral surgeon said that because there was no proof of anything of the scan he wouldn't do anything, so I went to my normal doctor to see if they could send me to pain management to deal with the pain, my doctor also switched me to tizanidine and diclofenac to see if that could help. It hasn't.\n\nMy pain management doctor is now doing steroid injections into the joint to see how they work, so far there's been no improvement and my primary doctor is now beginning to be concerned due to my increasing loss in weight and dropping blood pressure which has been caused by not being able to eat much or drink.\n\nI don't know what to do, I've tried so many conservative treatments, but everything feels like it's been failing. At this point my jaw is impacting my overall health, and I'm starting to have periods of blacking out from a mix of pain and what I'm assuming is low blood pressure. Does anyone know what to do? What to try? My insurance won't cover botox or that would be the next option, and my pain management doctor and I are hesitant to try and manage pain with opioids."""

I am nervous to do this as I hate to see her have a really bad purge with going off the antibiotic along with the initial purge that often comes with Accutane. I am also concerned about the possible negative side effects from Accutane. The doctor said that if we dont want to do the Accutane, she can stay on the antibiotics for 6 months but when she goes off the antibiotics, it is likely her acne will come back. Her doctor seems to be in favor of the accutane and says that she can stay on the Bactrim for the first two months she's on Accutane.\n\nI don't know what to do. I am a bit nervous about putting my daughter on Accutane. Maybe she should just stick with the antibiotics for 6 months as opposed to going on accutane. Has anyone gone off antibiotics and stayed clear? What are your thoughts on Accutane? It is just so hard on my daughter to go from persistent teenage acne to severe acne that has scarred her face all within 3 months. At this point, she would be happy just to get her skin back to what it was pre-Retin-A. Unfortunately, with all the scarring, I dont know if that will be possible. Will accutane help the scarring?

They turn brown over time. They last a long time (counting in weeks). I went to the doctor, he told me it was nothing. I suggested pityriasis versicolor, the dermatologist was skeptical, but directed me to mycological tests, which showed nothing. I got Isoconazole prophylactically. I don't know if it's not a coincidence, but the spots disappeared after using it, but maybe it's an apparent correlation.\n\nUsually, the spots are not raised or scaly. The one in the picture is a little noticeable under the finger. They do not itch.\n\nI have had cats for several months now and at first I reacted with an allergy to them, so I had to take Rupatadine.

codeine,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/12sgtnc/intense_existentialism/,b'Intense Existentialism??',,"b'I want to first start off by saying I have no idea where to post about this feeling but, the closest explanation I saw was on another post in this community so I just said, why not? \n\nAlso let me preface.I abuse substances heavily. I dont know if thatll have any correlation but, you be the judge of that -The first drug I tried at about 12 (aside from wine at the dinner table) was xanax, soon after codeine, then weed, liquor, and finally psychedelics all before the age of 16. As of now I abuse liquor the most, at about a 5th of gin a day since 2019 & a heavy weed smoker. I got bad with my DOC (Benzos) and have been off of em for about 2 years now. Im quite familiar with therapy, treatment, and have never been on any formal prescribed medication. However I have been formerly diagnosed with dysthymia (early onset) at age 9. Ive had a couple suey-wooey attempts once upon a time and even more ideations as well which makes what this post about a bit more perplexing to me\n\nFor about the past 5 years Ive been having a heady/intense feeling persist mentally & emotionally where it just seems so fucking unbelievable that Im conscious and connected with not only myself but, other human beings as wellI experience overwhelming senses of gratitude, compassion, condolence, etc - basically it seems as if every emotion I experience is accentuated to the point where they become psychosomatic, which ranges from elevated heartbeat, rapid breathing, pacing, general feelings of restlessness or even full-on vigor.  The initial onset of these feelings happened maybe the 2nd or 3rd time doing psychedelics when I was about 17. Ideas of highlighting the importance of community, deep investigative introspection, and adventuring the spectrum of experience/being flooded my mind.I wrote them off as basic hippie-ass ideas, as I was just a teenage boy finally learning true empathy and what it meant to actually exist for the first time and just assured myself this is normal and Im just maybe becoming a halfway decent human being. As time progressed, these ideas and feelings became progressively more intense and persistent, I could spend hours if not days in this state. With whomever I interact with I feel compelled to talk with them about their entire damn being, with fervency at that!down to how their mind works, family, traumas, living situations, you name it & all the while im deeply intrigued/invested/concerned to the point where it even feels like im creeping myself out (its pretty cringe honestly) Me just realizing I can simply control my body blows me away sometimes to the point where I need to sit down for 5 minutes. Every emotion I feel is just accentuated to the point where it becomes a rollercoaster.I made a joke at myself saying Im like a pregnant lady (but actually made somewhat of sense because I know alcohol decreases testosterone/increases estrogen and causes weight gain which ive been experiencing via beer belly and gynecomastic tits but I refuted back to myself saying this state first started at 17 however, i do recognize the alcohol isnt exactly helping either) - ideas and feelings of intense existentialism is the best way i can describe it (& its becoming quite ironic that i heavily denounce solipsism and often rant about how solipsism is plaguing the western world now)\n\nTo add more context, my boundaries werent always the best and still (obviously) arent. However I want to add I dont have problems saying or taking Nos to/from individuals and/or groups and, respecting boundaries. I express general tact and decorum while speaking to people and have possessed the gift of gab & a healthy amount of charisma from a very young age but this here is just unprecedented.\n\nI understand and want to acknowledge this is one of those good problem scenarios & I know there are individuals with waaaaay worse problems than I. It just feels as if im constantly on sensory/emotional/mental overload & paired with my history of drug use and mental illness I get the inkling there could be more to this\n\nIf you made it to the end of this regardless of the reason why, thanks & if anyone else has experienced this individually or knows more about what Im describing, please interact\n\n\nPS Im pretty familiar with most of the spiritual/metaphysical stuff and didnt want this entire post to be perceived that Im havin some stereotypical Lvl 1 ass spiritual awakening, as Im inquiring on a psychological level'"

Felt  100% after 4-5 days.\n\n**Thursday, December 22nd**:    Went to a large family event (everyone vaxxed), ate various tree  nuts,   drank alcohol. Got a little buzzed. Went to sleep at my in-laws  house,   they have two cats and two dogs. Slept on a carpet, and used a   sleeping  bag. House is clean, and animals aren't allowed in the room i   slept in.\n\n**Friday, December 23rd**:    woke up with a very itchy head. Showered, felt better. However, every    time i scratched an itch I would develop bumps (dermatographia)    anywhere, head to toe. Although the face area mostly just turns red.\n\n**Saturday, December 24th**: same symptoms. Began taking Allegra. 60mg 2x/day. Not much relief. Drank again at another family event.\n\n**Sunday, December 25th**: same symptoms, woke up with reflux. I opened a bottle of water and my hands hurts, stinging pain.\n\n**Monday, 26th**: went to urgent care. Prescribed Prednisone 20mg/day with a taper dosage, directed to keep taking allegra.\n\n**Today, Friday, December 30th**:    went to see a doc this morning. Explained and showed my symptoms. Any    scratch, minor or big, develops into hives at the area of scratching.    Doc advised me to take zyrtec once a day, pepcid, and bendaryl at  night.   Said unless I can't breathe or see, it is not a major concern.     Referred to allergist.

influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/wsxfer/seriously_need_help/,b'Seriously need help!',,"b"" Hi. Im a 21-year old male living here in the Philippines. This is a very long post, but please reply. Im so sad seeing my mom worries so much about me.\n\nThis all started the night of Aug 1. I slept very well since July, i'm even sleepy every afternoon, I am sleeping for 8-10 hrs every night back then. I even have a good sleep during the morning of Aug 1.The night of Aug 1, I had this weird hypnagogic hallucination when i tried to fall asleep. It is like a slideshow of some places in our house, feels like i'm walking through it. I have this thing since months ago. Also, I experienced that my limbs and hand were somewhat shaky and my fingers are mildly jerking when i try to sleep, and feels weird. And when im about to transition into actual sleep and drift off, i experienced a weird arousal sensation inside my head, resembling a brain zap (but not totally a jolt) of some sort. I wasnt able to sleep that night.\n\nThe arousal sensation is very hard to describe. But it is unpleasant to feel, like a blush of alertness or something. Very seldom, accompanied by a weird and very dull vibrating sound similar to a vibration of a phone.\n\nNext day,I tried to sleep in the morning and in the afternoon, and failed to do so since that weird arousal/alertness sensation prevents me to do so, even though im very sleepy. Then the night of Aug 2, I am still experiencing it and found it hard to fall asleep. Im very very rowsy and sleepy but the arousal sensation keeps on preventing me to actually drift off. But thankfully, i fell asleep at 2:30am until 7:30am straight. The following days were the same situation. Aug 3 I slept 4 hrs, followed by an all-nighter by the night of Aug 4. Aug 5. i slept for 5 hrs. I observed that when i try to fall asleep laying on my back, my throat have sounds like snoring whenever im about to fall asleep, together with the arousal sensation, which wakes me up.\n\nI had my check up with my neurologist this Aug 6, turned out that she diagnosed me with anxety, since i am very scared of the things i have read about this ffi that point. However, what bugs me is that i didn't have any anxiety at all when it started the night of Aug 1, and only read about FFI the following day. So how it is suppose to be anxiety then? But it is worth speaking that from the past months (June,July) im very stressed. She gave me quetiapine as prescribed med.\n\nAfter i was given some meds (quetiapine and sleep aid) I managed to sleep for like 11pm-6am, and waking up maybe like 1-2 times. I have dreams every time I fall asleep. I tend to not feel the arousal sensations when im about to fall asleep that night. However, the next morning, when i tried to sleep, i experienced it again, now with muscle jerking altogether.\n\nUp until now, the situation is constant. Like every time. And my hours of sleep are being shorten.\n\nAug 1 - 0Aug 2 - 5hrs (2:30-7:30)Aug 3 - 4 hrs (2:30-6:30)Aug 4 - 0Aug 5 - 5hrsAug 6 - 7hrs (11-6am) (started taking quetiapine 25mg and sleep suplement)Aug 7 - 6hrs (11-5am)Aug 8 - 6hrs (11-5am)Aug 9 - 6hrs (11-5am)Aug 10 - 6hrs (11-5am)Aug 11 - 5hrs (11- 4am)Aug 12 - 5 hrs (11 - 4am)Aug 13 - 6 hrs (11 - 5am)Aug 14 - 5 hrs (11 - 4am)Aug 15 - 4 hrs (10 - 2am)Aug 16 - 3 hrs (10-1am) and a few fragmented sleeps until 5amAug 17 - 2hrs (10-12:30am) and few fragmented sleeps with vivid dream each Aug 18 - 2hrs (9:30-11:30pm) and fragmented light sleeps Aug 19 - 1hr+ (9-11pm) with fragmented light sleeps\n\nOther issues:- whenever im thinking of something with my imagination (computing simple math, imagining a movie scene) my body or body parts jerks when im in rest and not moving.-Tinnitus- constipation- weakness of limbs- lump feeling in throat- minor memory issues- hot and cold flashes in some parts of my body- crawling insect sensations when i totally not move for a few minutes- numbness of body when not moving for a very long time- sweating\n\nMedical history:- Have a thoracic scoliosis- cbc tests are all normal- blood pressure is good- has an history of muscle twitching since years ago- Had tetanus and anti-rabbies vaccine this june and july- Our family doesn't have history of dementia or alike, and absolutely no history of FFI. (Our country also doesn't have one)\n\nI'm sorry if this is a long post. It hurts me to see my parents worry so much.\n\nAll responses are very much appreciated! Thank you guys!"""

It was supposed to be excised last March 2020 but the pandemic happened, then my surgeon died, and then I developed agoraphobia. I've had GAD, GERD, and IBS since 2012 but it got worse during the lockdown. I'm currently seeing a psychologist for it. No other notable history, but I've had recurring boils from 2008-2009 and then 2016-2019, and then 2022-2023. During 2016-2019, it was always treated with antibiotics. Had a full workup done and all the numbers were normal. Haven't had new tests since 2020, though, due to my agoraphobia. I'm having trouble leaving my house and I only feel safe when I'm in areas I'm familiar with (car, grocery, a cafe)\n\nMy current issue is this infected sebaceous cyst. I've been trying to make lifestyle changes, which started in March, by going to a nutritionist, following a diet plan, and doing workouts. On March 16, originally thought that my arm was sore due to working out but then concluded that it was the area around the cyst that was tender.\n\nMarch 17: I had a tele-consult with a dermatologist and she told me that it's normal that the cyst and the area around it feel tender since it's a bit big (approx. 2cm across). She advised me to apply .005% Tretinoin cream on it to help it along.\n\nMarch 18: I had a tele-consult with my family doctor who has seen my cyst before it was infected, and we had a video call and I showed her photos. I was prescribed Clindamycin 300mg 3x a day.\n\nI'm attaching progress photos here: [https://imgur.com/a/iurf7RO](https://imgur.com/a/iurf7RO)\n\nI was also advised to go to a surgeon once the swelling goes down. I consulted with my PCP again yesterday since I was panicking and felt like I need to go to the Emergency Department. She told me to wait until my appointment with the surgeon on Tuesday (March 28). I'm supposed to consult with her again tomorrow to see if I need to extend my antibiotics.\n\nRight now, the swollen/hard part kind around the cyst has kind of gone down already but it still hurts when pressure is applied to the area. I guess I'm just panicking and imagining worst-case scenarios. Before the pandemic, I was a professional violinist, and now I'm a painter and writer and I'm really scared about losing my arm. I'd really like a second opinion or some reassurance, please. I don't know what to do, and I feel so stuck since I'm still unable to function normally.  \n\n\nLocation: Philippines"""

She went to the dermatologist and was prescribed Retin-A gel 0.25%. With the Retin-A, her acne got worse. I encouraged her to continue using it, explaining that it is common to purge when first starting Retin-A. By the third month, my daughter went from persistent acne to severe acne fully covering her face. It was so hard for her to deal with this. It seemed to be more than a purge and more like she was having a very adverse reaction to Retin-A.\n\nAlong with the extreme acne, she started to develop lots of scarring so we sent photos to her Derm who took her off Retin-A and prescribed Bactrim along with Epiduo (Adpalene and Benzoyl Peroxide). She started the Bactrim but was reluctant/afraid to continue the Epiduo as it was aggravating her acne, giving her the same results as the Retin-A. She continued with the Bactrim and stopped the Epiduo and added in Azelia Acid.\n\nSo her routine now is:\n\nAM - Rinse with water - Moisturize with Sebamed - Sunscreen, Biore UV Watery Essence - Take Bactrim\n\nPM - Wash with Vanicream somedays or with a benzoyl peroxide wash other days - Azelaic Acid - Moisturize with Sebamed - Take Bactrim.\n\nShe has just started her second month on Bactrim and we have seen a lot of her active acne clear up. She still has a lot of PIE so it looks like her acne is worse than it really is. Her Doctor wants to put her on Accutane. I am nervous to do this as I hate to see her have a really bad purge with going off the antibiotic along with the initial purge that often comes with Accutane. I am also concerned about the possible negative side effects from Accutane. The doctor said that if we dont want to do the Accutane, she can stay on the antibiotics for 6 months but when she goes off the antibiotics, it is likely her acne will come back. Her doctor seems to be in favor of the accutane and says that she can stay on the Bactrim for the first two months she's on Accutane.\n\nI don't know what to do. I am a bit nervous about putting my daughter on Accutane. Maybe she should just stick with the antibiotics for 6 months as opposed to going on accutane. Has anyone gone off antibiotics and stayed clear? What are your thoughts on Accutane? It is just so hard on my daughter to go from persistent teenage acne to severe acne that has scarred her face all within 3 months. At this point, she would be happy just to get her skin back to what it was pre-Retin-A. Unfortunately, with all the scarring, I dont know if that will be possible. Will accutane help the scarring?

Or in technical terms, I have emetophobia. That on its own is problematic, but right now it's especially problematic because one of the possible side-effects of the Covid vaccine is nausea and vomiting. Yet I know I need to get the vaccine, for my own safety as well as the safety of all those around me. But what can I do? I'm scared to get it if there's a chance it might make me nauseous or throw up. Both my parents are fully vaccinated which I'm really happy for, and my dad had no real problems but my mom had a bad reaction to it. She was really tired and didn't feel well, and she ended up throwing up once or twice because of it. We called the doctor and he said that vomiting was sorta rare but nothing to really worry about. So we kept an eye on her and by the next day she was pretty much better, though it took a few more days for her to fully recover and get her energy back. I've heard women are more likely to be affected by side effects than men, and younger people in general are more likely to be affected because their immune systems are stronger. \n\nI'm a 24 year old woman and have half my mother's DNA (obviously, because she's my mom) so I'm terrified that when I get my first or second shot of the vaccine I'll be nauseous and throw up too! Isn't there any way I can prevent this? I've heard of anti-emetics, medication that's supposed to keep people from throwing up and they give it to people after surgery, but I don't think that's something I can just buy over the counter or ask a doctor to give me. Plus I'm on antidepressants (for depression and anxiety) and I don't know if there would be any interactions. I wonder if the type of vaccine makes a difference? Both my parents got Pfizer, would Moderna be less likely to cause vomiting maybe? Can I request Moderna instead? Please help!"""
NSAID,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/rxlpd8/ibuprofen_nsaid_allergy_and_testing/,"b'Ibuprofen, NSAID allergy and testing?'",,"b""In summer 2020 I took extra strength Advil for a bad headache and I'm 99% sure I had an allergic reaction to it because I don't remember consuming anything else out of the ordinary. Prior, I've never had allergies (in my 20s now) though I did have a whole body hive reaction to some unknown cause around 10 years ago. I've taken a lot of Motrin in my childhood and I'm pretty sure I've taken Advil too, though I'd say as I grew older I rarely took anything for pain unless it was sickness-related in which I'd take Tylenol. I have used Voltaren emugel, the NSAID 'cream' for muscle pain, decently often.\n\nAnyways that day, I developed a stuffy and runny nose, sneezing, and started to feel cold. I thought it was just cold symptoms or something to do with the fact that I also wasn't well-rested. That was until my nose got really stuffy and runny fast in addition to it feeling like I had a lump in my throat when I swallowed which I couldn't tell if it was from me panicking, or my throat was actually tightening or both... I then realized I was having an allergic reaction (around 45 min after I had consumed Advil) and took Reactine which calmed everything down in the next hour or 2.\n\nCalled my family doctor who told me I had an anaphylactic reaction and to just stay away from Advil which was very probably the cause (or the coating on it). But also, I've used Voltaren on myself after this with no problem and she said then I can use that as an alternative. I also asked my doctor if I could be referred to do some allergy tests to fully confirm this but she said there's no test for this?\n\nI can't tell if I'm allergic to just Advil or all NSAIDs and if I'm only allergic to specific use routes. Since this is my first allergy too, it's been making me paranoid on and off to not know the exact cause of what happened especially since the reaction wasn't mild. Does anyone have a similar experience/know if it's possible for me to pinpoint with testing? It's come up again as a concern since I'm starting an oral pill medical treatment soon which could cause pains as a side effect but Tylenol shouldn't be used due to the added liver stress - planning ahead here just brought up a prior paranoia to light.\n\nAny insight is greatly appreciated!"""

I also tend to get headaches along with this. It has majorly impacted my life. I am struggling to attend any school because I get exhausted within a 1-3 hours and the teacher basically tells me I look horrendous and to go home.\n\nJoint pain/swelling - I have a pretty much constant ache and occasional stabbing pain in my joints (primarily my hands, wrists, ankles and toes). Anti-inflammatory pain relief seems to help more than things like Panadol. The pain varies in strength, sometimes it's just kind of there, other times I'm crying in pain. My hands also swell up and go quite puffy.\n\nMouth Ulcers - I get lots of small ulcers mostly on my tongue and inner lip, with the occasional big ulcer.\n\nRash - I get a rash on my face usually after being out in the sun (or in shopping malls weirdly, don't know if there is an explanation for that). It is mainly on my cheeks. It isn't raised and is mild red in colour. It feels very hot to the touch and my face feels a bit like it is burning (similar feeling to sunburn but this only lasts a few hours). \n\nHair loss - nothing dramatic but I definitely noticed more hair coming out when I wash/brush it than normal. I have had a painful scalp at times however I do have sensitive skin so it could just be the shampoo/conditioner reacting with my scalp.\n\nChest tightness/difficulty breathing - once again nothing dramatic but I have definitely had some tightness in my chest and a shortness of breath at times. I do have asthma however it is very mild and I rarely have any issues. I'm not sure if this is a symptom of whatever is going on or if my asthma may just be playing up.\n\nUrine - I have had urine that burns when I pee and also I have been going to the toilet more frequently. I had a urine test at the start which I think was all normal however I didn't have the painful urine at the time. I have used some urine test strips and have had slightly raised leukocytes, protein, urobilinogen and I think some ketones. The pH has been around 5-6. I have just done urine sample testing for infection and am waiting on results.\n\nBlood work - I have had multiple blood tests all of which are for the most part normal. The only abnormalities have been an ESR of 20 however it has varied I think it has been 8, 11, 13 and 20 twice. My ALT liver test was a bit raised (can't remember by how much it was a while ago) and a slightly abnormal Anion Gap. My Vit D was also low about 6 months in to bring unwell (was normal to begin with). I have had my ANA tested which was negative. Thyroid was normal. I have also been tested for a few different viruses and things which were all negative.\n\nFamily History: \nMy dad has most likely got rheumatoid arthritis (had positive RF once and negative once) seen a rheumatologist who thought it was likely. He is waiting to seem him again. He is also has psoriasis. Also not 100% sure on the details but when I was a baby he got meningitis, encephalitis and myelitis all at the same time he somehow survived but then his body started attacking itself once again he survived but has spinal cord damage(I think there is a proper name for it but unsure as to what that is).\n\nThere is type one diabetes in the family and I have cousin with either lupus or rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. My uncle also has seen a doctor who most likely thinks he has Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis (All mum's side).\n\nMedical Appointments - \n\nIn July/August last year I was referred to a pediatric rheumatologist. By the end of the first appointment he told me that he was pretty much sure I had lupus and that he was going to re-do the ANA in about 8 weeks and he would see me sometime around then. The ANA remained negative and he said he was shocked that it was negative. He said he wasn't really sure what to do but said it was worth seeing a gastroenterologist because of the mouth Ulcers.\n\nI saw the gastroenterologist and when I told him my symptoms he said it sounded like lupus. He examined my and asked questions but at the end of it he sort of said that he wasn't really sure why I was there but he would do a blood test for celiacs incase. \n\nA couple months later my GP referred me to a paediatrician. He also didn't really know what to do. He said my symptoms sound like lupus and if I hadn't been already he would send me to the rheumatologist that I had already seen.\n\nI then saw a second rheumatologist. She didn't really know what was going on but she said we have to try something. So she started me on amitriptyline and piroxicam for about 3 months. The amitriptyline didn't help but the piroxicam did help with the joint pain. I went back see her again and she stopped the amitriptyline. She didn't know what to do but once again wanted to try something so she started me on plaquenil. She told me to also slowly stop the piroxicam once after about a month on plaquenil.\n3 months later and I am pretty sure the plaquenil helped however I have been unwell (caught covid). Which keeps setting me back. I went to see her again and she wants to stop the plaquenil soon. I don't mind her however she seems to be all over the place (it's like she doesn't read notes before seeing you) we told her we had stopped the piroxicam and she asked why (when she told us to). She seemed to think that I had told her I had a virus and then got sick when I never had a virus, and just other things like that. \n\nAny ideas of what this could be would be much appreciated as after a year of basically no life I am starting to really struggle. If you have any questions I will try to answer them. Any ideas of what might be going on I'll bring up with my GP next appointment.\n\nThanks."""

Big Fat yes, also my kiddos had it, we all did. We tried doing a bit of herbal treatment first but then we ended up taking the 10 day metronidazol treatment. It was like being high all the time, and feeling really weird. After, no giardia... Still now, no reoccuring giardia. I had about 15 tests so its very much tested. My real problems started shortly after .... J thought i could finally have fun again! But no.... I started getting serious episodes of diarrhoea (and serious panic attacks) i started losing weight ... And the diarrhoea would not stop. Until summer... Then i could suddenly wat again without having constant diarrhoea. In the meantime i had seen a gastro and they detected that my stool had a much too hight undigested dat in it so they gave me enzymes. That didnt really do much... So i stopped. I just felt different, then my back started to feel inflamed and i could hardly walk. Nausia always by my side.. its like i was (am) a ghost of this person i used to be. After summer i had some beers (i dont really drink alcohol) and that night my stomach e started making the strangest sounds and all the horror came back, diarrhoea, and all the time... I was in so much pain also because my anu had an abcess that i hadtoo go to hospital for, they opened it, gave me antibiotics (i couldnt finish the course of antibiotics because it made me even sicker) but the abcess now has turned into 2 fistulas. So... Then i went on a fodmap dieet in december wich felt really good for a while but within three weeks diarrhoea started coming back again, and dit stopping. So i went back to only white bread. I always have gas , and constant pain in the bowels. My ears are always ringing and i am exhausted. I was just admitted in hospital this week. Because i had lost so much minerals etc. I was there for a night, but now in back. The blood results and stool and urine all look ok, and that is unnerving because i am really not ok. i really want my life back, and want to take care of my children and watch them grow and play with them. I really am so sad, the person i was before giardia (or metro) has gone and now it seems i am sick. Not investing anything properly ( also if i dont have diarrhoea, i have gas gas had, and sticky weird poop)   i also cannot take any supplements because they give me.... Yes diarrhoea! My daily eating consists of white bread, and soup and little bites of veggies and fruit but very small.\nI am lost .....\n\nSorry for the long story, i am just so sad and feel broken or something.

Got both Pfizer shots, no booster. Have never gotten COVID that I know of. Relatively healthy diet, mostly dairy free. I don\'t drink coffee.\n\nHello. I\'ve been struggling with a mystery medical problem that\'s seemingly ruining my life. As stated in the title, I\'m feeling pretty alone in this right now and I\'m just looking for anyone else who has experienced this, and possibly some answers on what\'s going on and how I can get better. This is causing such a poor quality of life for me, and exacerbates my depression/anxiety, especially when doctors dismiss my symptoms and say *""that just sounds like anxiety, sweaty""*. I decided to stop disclosing that I have anxiety, but it would still get blamed for my problems regardless, because of course, since I\'m a woman, and sick, and it\'s not the common cold, it must be all in my head *\\*satire\\*.* Needless to say, finding answers has been exhausting and frustrating.\n\nIt\'s also a possibility in my mind that whatever this problem is, it may be something I\'ve always had and just didn\'t know.\n\nIt all started September 2020 when my partner and I both got really sick (he was sick for about 1.5-2 weeks, I was sick for closer to 3). We both got tested for COVID and strep, both negative. At this time we weren\'t allowed in the doctor\'s office and were tested in a parking garage, so after those 2 were ruled out, they said it was likely an **upper respiratory infection** (which I\'ve had a lot growing up, so made sense to me). We were given meds and sent on our way. My partner got better no problem. Me, not exactly. Everything went away except one major symptom: **thick mucus stuck in my throat that won\'t come out**.\n\nThat may not seem like a bad issue, but it\'s been hell honestly. Just imagine having *thick, wet globs* of mucus in your throat that you can\'t cough up FOR YEARS!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThis one issue snowballed into all of these **symptoms:**\n\n\\- **thick mucus stuck in my throat** (can rarely cough it up because it\'s too thick, when I can it\'s green/sometimes has dry blood in it)\n\n\\- **waking up in the middle of the night gasping for air,** feels like I\'m suffocating because I can\'t breathe bc my throat is closing, other times it\'s the mucus completely blocking my airway\n\n\\- **gasping for air** ***during the day*** is becoming more frequent\n\n\\- **hoarse/lose my voice daily**\n\n\\- **burns to talk** when I push my voice too hard (I talk for a living so unavoidable)\n\n\\- **shortness of breath** even doing regular everyday tasks\n\n\\- **constant throat clearing/cough**\n\n\\- **trouble swallowing** (esophagus feels swollen/much smaller on the inside so have to take relatively small bites)\n\n\\- **bloating after eating**\n\n\\- **right lymph node consistently swollen/uncomfortable**\n\n\\- **neck popping** on right side, sometimes painful\n\n\\- randomly **losing balance/near fainting** spells and **dizziness**\n\n\\- **headaches/migraines (new for me)**\n\n\\- **muscle weakness**\n\n\\- **back pain in the morning**\n\n\\- extreme **sensivity to light/watery eyes** (\\*lifelong issue, but worse now\\* especially indoors with lots of windows)\n\n\\- **increased heart rate even when doing nothing** (new within the last 2-3 months)\n\n\\- **extreme fatigue** ((\\*lifelong issue, but worse now\\*))\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Previous/Existing diagnoses:** Raynaud\'s syndrome, ADHD, anxiety w/panic\n\n**Current meds/vitamins/treatment:** birth control pill daily, adderall 25mg once/day, Levalbuterol via nebulizer twice daily, Albuterol inhaler as needed.

Still have my tonsils. Once around 8 or 9, I woke up and couldn\'t move my body from the waist down and was hospitalized. They couldn\'t find anything wrong. Once around 12 I was leaking whiteish liquid from my breasts and they thought it may be cancer. It was not. Around 13/14 I started feeling very light headed in the shower and my vision would go black and I couldn\'t hear anything. Pediatrician said I was anemic and deficient in vitamin D. Prescribed salt pills and vitamin D. Struggled a lot in school in comparison to others despite heavy studying and attending tutoring often, from elementary to high school. Periods very painful, heavy, and lasted around10-12+ days. Started taking birth control pills at 19 and have been skipping periods since then. I have about 4-5 periods a year. Never been pregnant. No STDs. Only major surgeries: wisdom teeth removal twice, sesamoidectomy (foot) surgery 2021. Took accutane twice as a teenager. Have had bad skin since about 6 years old, acne, premature aging by 18. Had braces twice, teeth/jaw/bite still not right. TMJ problems, will need jaw surgery in the future. Have always gotten a burning sensation in my throat when running/vigorous exercises, and have to stop early not because I can\'t push my body any further, but because my throat\'s on fire. Shin splits always happen when doing cardio. When I was about 20 I gained about 40lbs within 2 months (side effect from medication) and was told I was prediabetic. I\'ve since lost the weight, no longer prediabetic. I\'ve had 3 concussions and 1 major seizure (caused by medication). September 2021 had excess white blood cells in urine at gyno appointment. Always been tired no matter how much sleep I get. Body does not respond to caffeine. Can be difficult to do normal or even fun things when I\'m often exhausted, physically and mentally. Fatigue/brain fog/memory problems for as long as I can remember. Very pale, inability to tan, very sensitive to the sun, skin burns very easily (can happen in less than 10 mins without sunscreen. I now wear sunscreen everyday).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**What doctors have said:**\n\nInsurance at the time required referrals to see specialists. My **first PCP** *refused* to refer me to an ENT *for several months* (I\'m talking I got sick in September 2020, verbally requested around October then several times via email and calls and during checkups, and didn\'t see the ENT until MAY 2021!! and this doctor also missed a whole broken bone in my foot so...love that for me) because *she was offended* that I didn\'t ""trust her"" to solve my issues on her own (even though it was all telehealth and she never actually physically examined me???) But I eventually got them to get me a referral.\n\n**ENT** *confirmed there is a lot of mucus indeed stuck in my throat*. She put a camera up my nose and down my throat (I was not prepared for that btw, not fun). However she said that since it was too far down and ""around a corner"" per say, she couldn\'t use her tools to get it out for me and instead prescribed some meds that did nothing. She said I have acid reflux and gave me instructions on how to reduce it. I did everything suggested and reflux is rare now, but the problem still remains. After 2ish months she confirmed again there\'s still mucus back there. But the good news is she said I don\'t have any vocal cord damage which is amazing. But she also mentioned she\'s never had a patient with the same issues I have and doesn\'t know how to help at this point, I just love hearing that from my doctors. She suggested I see a GI specialist. Had to pause all visits for about 6 months bc I lost my insurance after quitting my extremely toxic/abusive workplace.\n\nThe gaslighting starts here with the **GI specialist** who *ran zero tests*, said I was too young to be having these issues (okay so explain why I\'m having them, and shouldn\'t it be alarming that I\'m having these issues ""so young""?). She suggested it\'s likely ""just anxiety."" She said I should have stuck with working with an ENT for my problems, didn\'t understand why I was referred to her, but gave me a prescription to try anyway. Surprise, it didn\'t help.\n\nThe **Allergy specialist** I saw was a sweet old lady and I really believe she tried everything she knew. Worked with her for about 6 months. Said I was positive for a sinus infection and said that it\'s likely what I\'ve had the entire time. Did a pulmonary function test and said my breathing was abnormal and my lung capacity is much worse than it should be at my age and given lifestyle. She treated me for the sinus infection and later gave me an inhaler to take twice a day, along with an emergency inhaler to use before exercise. At a follow up she said my lung capacity was at 70. I still don\'t know exactly what this means, but it didn\'t sound good. I suggested wanting to get a chest x-ray done, and to see a pulmonologist at this point and she agreed. Got chest x-ray done, she called me and said ""everything looks fine"" and that was it on that. I got a food allergy test done bc at this point I\'m thinking something I\'m eating everyday could be the cause, but no. (I will say I\'d like to redo the test with another ENT for a second opinion, bc the way this test was carried out was unusual imo) After this, she told me my body is so sensitive and she\'s tried everything and doesn\'t know how else to help me. I just about lost it right there, it was just so devastating to hear. One of her final suggestions was that it could be ""a minor cough"" like she has, and/or it could be all in my head from \\*drumroll\\* *anxiety*. Even after having proof from the ENT that there is definitely mucus there and I\'m not imagining it. Just wonderful.\n\nSaw a **pulmonologist** and they *completely dismissed me* and *didn\'t test me for anything*. Said something along the lines of, ""honey this is just anxiety what you\'re describing, us women have it, it\'s very common!"" and that anxiety can create a ""lump in the throat"" sensation, but nothing is there. DESPITE AN ENT STICKING A CAMERA DOWN MY THROAT AND CONFIRMING SOMETHING IS IN THERE! *She suggested trying regular, over the counter meds that I\'ve already tried. ((wow, doctor you cured me!!))* This interaction was infuriating!\n\nWent to a **naturopath** to see if alternative medicine would work for me. They drew my blood, forgot to test me for immunodeficiencies/autoimmune disorders (love that), but did state that my B12 was low and my vitamin D is one of the lowest she\'s ever seen (no shock to me, I\'ve always been told this since I was a kid, I just hadn\'t taken vitamins in a while). Suggested I buy her expensive vitamin supplements, but I just got some from amazon bc I just couldn\'t afford vitamins for over $70/month each. She also asked me about my past and family life and said that *sometimes when you hold on to trauma too long, it can cause problems with your gut health* which is where our immune system is etc and can become weakened, and manifest into physical illnesses that won\'t go away until the trauma is correctly processed and immune system is healed. On one hand it sounds far out, but on the other hand it did kind of make sense. But at the same time, for me, I know my issues started as an actual illness. She said I need to start therapy, (and also purchase a very expensive controversial water therapy program she was selling) but at that time I couldn\'t afford that.\n\nFound a **new** **pulmonologist** on a whim while just messing around on google maps in my area and decided to give it a try. Went to my first appointment with him about 2 weeks ago, told him everything, showed him my x-rays. This is the first doctor I\'ve seen so far that seems like he actually cares. He told me *he believes me*, and knows it isn\'t "" just anxiety"" and that he will try his very best to help me. I felt so validated and so heard and understood that day. He said the x-rays do not indeed look normal and ordered a chest CT scan. He suggested that I stop using my inhaler bc it was likely *making my problems worse* by drying out my throat, which causes my body to super overproduce mucus. Also prescribed a **nebulizer** to use twice a day, and told me to take regular **Mucinex without the D** so I can try to cough some of the mucus up. I\'ll be going in for a follow up next week for my results.\n\nWent to my **new PCP** also about 2 weeks ago. He was also a shining star in my eyes, bc he also seems very caring and really wanted to help me. He said he sees weird and unique situations all the time so he seemed confident in helping me. They drew some blood that day, and also wanted me to get a 2nd round of bloodwork done somewhere else for more in depth tests/results. I have an appointment next week for the 2nd round of bloodwork, and will have a follow up soon after that. In the meantime, they called with the first half of my results, saying my **B12 was high** but that\'s okay, that my **vitamin D levels are insanely high** and could result in vitamin D toxicity so cut back on the dosage, and that my **blood** **platelet count was a lot higher than usual**, but they said we\'ll discuss that further and also retest it at my next appointment. For context, they said the normal range is between 130-140, but mine was 421. From what I understand, the rest of the bloodwork will be tested for autoimmune disorders, thyroid issues, cancer and a few other things.\n\n**BONUS:** I\'m just getting over another upper respiratory infection that lasted about 3 weeks. During the 2nd week I had 3 instances within an hour while I was awake at home on my computer, where my throat was closing on me and I was gasping for air. Felt like I was gonna die. Decided to go to the ER (my partner drove me). The doctor there was one of the worst I\'ve ever encountered and he actually made me cry when we left. First thing he asked is, ""so, what exactly are you expecting me to do?"" ...I was shook to say the least. Didn\'t see that coming at all. I said, ""I\'m expecting you to help me."" He proceeds to tell me that ""this is an ER. You are not having an emergency. If you came to me WHILE you couldn\'t breathe, I could\'ve helped. But you\'re perfectly fine right now. You\'re not showing signs of panic or distress and your vitals are fine. So what do you expect me to do?"" VERY close to me, staring me down, speaking in a very condescending tone. I was just so blown away by his behavior and lack of empathy. I said, ""Okay, so how would you help me if my throat was closing or I had mucus blocking my airway right now, what would you do?"" He said, ""Well, there are so many different things we could do depending on the situation, I could shove a breathing tube down your throat, or even better, I could shove one of those tubes down your throat that we use on BABIES, kinda like when they have too many boogers in their noses and suck all of that stuff out of there."" The way he said that was definitely to make me feel bad and to compare my problem to a baby who can\'t blow their nose. Just insane. Something has to be done about the way patients are treated when seeking help. I understand some people go to the ER for nothing. But not everyone. I told him I felt like I was dying. He said he couldn\'t do anything and doesn\'t know what to tell me. All the medications I\'ve tried is something he would\'ve suggested, which, fair on that since I have tried a lot. But then someone came in with some paperwork for me to sign saying something about I agree that I was treated today, argued with her for a minute saying I wasn\'t treated. She gave me paperwork to take home and it said to take Allegra -\\_- I refused to sign the paperwork and left. I just thought that was such a wild situation I wanted to include it.\n\nSo, that\'s where I\'m at right now. I appreciate any comments, and thank you so much if you took the time to read this whole thing <3\n\n**TLDR:** I\'ve had mucus stuck in my throat for over 2 years that\'s too thick to cough up and after seeing several doctors and specialists no one can figure out what exactly is wrong, why this is happening or how to treat it. This is causing a laundry list of other problems including breathing problems, losing my voice daily, throat closing, and mucus blocking my airways which makes me feel like I\'m suffocating. I\'ve tried tons of medications. It is affecting my quality of life significantly. Looking for answers or comfort in knowing I\'m not the only one going through this.\n\n*\\*cross posted bc I\'m desperate for answers\\**'"

covid,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1328kdi/lack_of_daylight_in_my_eyes_caused_my_chronic/,b'Lack of daylight in my eyes caused my chronic insomnia.',,"b'I have had the worst insomnia you can have, probably. It got progressively worse and worse and the months before I found out the reason. which I did about two weeks ago, I slept 0 hours per night at least several nights a week. The other nights, 1-2 hours per night. Sometimes 3-4 if I was extremely lucky. I tell you this so you can comprehend the severity of the problem.\n\nIt started as difficulty falling asleep and then waking up early and not being able to fall asleep again.\n\nI wont go into specifics on how I found out because it is very simple to figure out if you might suffer from the same reason I did: lack of sunshine. Not on your skin and vitamin D, but lack of strong daylight in your eyes in the hours after awakening.\n\nIf you do not get at least 1 hour of strong daylight in your eyes within 2 hours of awakening, and even more during the day, for many days, weeks, in a row, either by not being outside or wearing sunglasses or glasses with photochromatic lens when you go outside, or in my case both of this, you may be affected by this. \n\nIt has to do with your circadian rhythm, which is set by daylight. Insufficent daylight can rupture your rhythm and cause it to disappear entirely. This is what happened to me and as I have told you, the symptoms were incredibly serious. I have had the worst period of my life because of this. \n\nIt took more than a week of daylight every day to recover so if you try, dont dismiss it if it doesnt work at once.\n\nThis post is my way of helping others suffering from what is easily not even considered being a reason for insomnia.\nIf this helps you, tell others and raise awareness of this. I wouldnt be surprised if this is what caused insomnia to rise with covid (work from home, stay inside til noon etc).'"

levothyroxine,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/12fhffq/sleep_issues_hypothyroidism/,b'Sleep issues + Hypothyroidism',,"b'I have hypothyroidism diagnosed since 2014. Idk my levels atm; havent had blood work in awhile. I take Levothyroxine daily 75 mg (I was taking 50 and they switched to 75 when I was pregnant but never switched back to 50 like they said they would after giving birth) I started taking it at night instead of morning after a suggestion. I naturally feel low energy and have anxiety, depression. I get a lot of anxiety related to lack of sleep because when I have 0 hours or 1-2 hours of sleep my gag reflex kicks in for part of the day, Im more fatigued, sometimes get nauseated. -I was sick 3 weeks ago w a cold, Covid flu etc ruled out. When Im sick due to the thyroid Im sick longer than the average person. Im still recovering; my energy is even lower after being sick w anything and takes days to gain back normal energy. Ive been struggling as Im still recovering so Ive not gained back my energy as usual and last week I went a night w zero sleep and this week another night w 1 hour and both the day after I was miserable due to feeling extreme exhaustion. More than I have felt when I havent been sick/recovering. To the point I couldnt do anything, needed help to walk to the bathroom for example. Tonight I havent slept again. I did get sleep the following nights, 4-6 hours. Ive been having a stricter night routine to try n help. Tonight it didnt. \nI have tried the lot over the years (have dealt w insomnia since I was a teenager, even as a kid struggled due to sleep issues triggered by ocd) Ive tried diet, exercise, no phone/screen, temperature and lights and timing of when I wake up/go to bed. Tried OTC and scripts thru the years. Some have worked but always briefly like a few months tops. OTC and scripts Id get side effects and be told I had to stop taking it or switch to something else, up the dose, lower the dose, often got constant nightmares on these meds. Considering trying something again but very anxious. Ive heard only bad things about ambien and Im scared to read up on other meds. Idr what I even took when I had scripts. Been off those meds for years. 1) how can I get through this anxiety on trying a script again?\n\nIve also tried other things weighted blankets music binural beats podcasts white noise brown noise smoking weed drinking tea meditation or even day dreaming to tire my mind, journaling etc etc you name it Ive probably tried it. I struggle falling asleep mostly but staying asleep as well. When I sleep I wake up thru the night and some nights are better than others like waking up 1x vs 3+. Sometimes it takes 1 he to fall asleep on good nights but mostly 2+ Im a very light sleeper too even with white noise, earplugs. Lately my ocd has reared its head again adding on to the difficulty. As a kid up to today its been hard each night to get comfortable, things have to be just so in order to sleep. Ive been on meds for that too and nothing helped. Im not big on pharmaceuticals. \n\nIdk if change in my thyroid dose would help. I never oversleep. Ik thats common w hyper not hypo but I have hypo and its awful trying to fall asleep. I feel broken and like Im missing out on something for not being able to sleep so easily like those around me. \n\nI get anxious too worrying I wont sleep the next night either. Ik worrying doesnt help! Im so upset now it being 6 am no sleep and knowing how exhausted Ill feel and was looking forward to my plans which I cant do now. Will I be ok not sleeping again? I get so exhausted thru my body it feels like Im dying, and when I take anything to help sleep I hate the feeling it gives me of that overwhelming tiredness. I go to bed feeling so sleepy cant keep my eyes open yet still remain awake. Usually it doesnt happen this often in a month where I get no sleep at night so its concerning but ik its related to being sick in combo w ocd flaring. \nNote no sleep apnea. \n\nAnyone else deal with this and know what I mean in terms of exhaustion in tandem with hypothyroidism \n\nIm so desperate im thinking to get a script again but my doctors are closed thru the weekend and im scared to not get sleep until then. Thanks for any thoughts any help anything \n\n(If it matters im in my early 30s, healthy bmi, average diet could always be better but no fast food soda, been sick and postpartum several months now so no consistent exercise but am mobile due to children, father watches baby at night so I can try to sleep)'"

We get there and my nurse partner gets the story from the sending MD while my EMT partner and I set up the ventilator and IV pump for his meds (nicardipine and precedex).\\*\n\nMy EMT partner that day is... special. They will do *anything* you ask them to do, and with a great attitude, but they have *no* initiative and no capability for independent thought. If you want them to do something, you have to describe it in excruciating detail, and if you don't ask them, it doesn't happen. So getting him ready to go is pretty much me doing everything by myself, occasionally asking my EMT partner to go get this or that from our bag.\n\nAnyhow, we get him packaged up, double check all of the things, switch O2 supply from the wall to our gurney tank, and we boogie out to the rig.\n\nWe didn't call a trauma report to DATCMC before we got there. The sending MD had called ahead, they knew he was coming in *at some point,* and were holding a bed for him, but we didn't call ahead to let them know exactly *when.*\n\nCharge and the UA there were *heated*. I get it; I don't blame them. But there's only time for so many things. It was not even a ten minute drive. My nurse is, for all intents and purposes, alone back there and she's got to get a BP on this dude who is fighting every aspect of this (not that I blame him). We're giving him enough precedex for, let's say, a cranky toddler who needs a nap, and not, rather, an adult male with a tube in his throat, being accosted by gang of rude strangers comitting a very circumscribed assault against him by pulling him around in a hammock and squeezing the ever-loving shit out of his limbs, one at a time.\n\nBy the time she's finished that fight, decided whether that number warrants a titration of the nicardipine, and has made a quick note on, like, ***A*** thing, boom, we're there. I couldn't call the report because I was busy driving code 3 in stealth mode (see previous statement about the precedex), and the other EMT couldn't call because as helpful as they are, they lack the initiative required to execute the complex and interconnected series of tasks required to call a trauma report without significant and repeated prompting.\n\nSo it didn't happen. Despite the conditions, it *should* have happened. Probably while we were still on the wall at TNATC Memorial.\n\nSorry, guys. We learned.\n\n---\n\\* Anticipating certain objections, the nurse checks everything before we actually connect it to the patient."""

I believe it is considered a muscle relaxer, but I may be wrong on that. I\'m supposed to take 1 pill every 6 hours.\n\nThe medicine does a good job of helping my stomach symptoms, but I immediately realized I couldn\'t do the 4x a day dosage, as dicyclomine makes you feel ""stoned"" about 20ish minutes after you take it, and you can\'t drive like that.\n\nAfter years of experimenting, I take two before bed and it puts me right out to sleep, and I know how to use my medicine appropriately so it does what it is supposed to without fucking me over.\n\nBut I\'m on a drug board, so of course I\'ve abused this shit too. Taking two makes me feel cross faded, and if I\'ve been drinking or smoking, it makes me feel straight up drunk even if I haven\'t had much to drink/smoke. It causes a weird empty feeling in one\'s stomach and a light headedness as well.\n\nIf more is taken, it definitely becomes a dissociative and impacts memory. The few times I\'ve done more than 3-4 at once, I\'ve regretted it and remembered little, and felt a bit off the next day.\n\nCombined with acid/shrooms this shit becomes a nightmare and somehow always manages to turn the trip to a dark place, even if one can\'t feel the effects of dicyclomine really. I made the mistake of taking 2 pills in the woods on a high dose of acid and straight up thought I had lost control of my body and was ""locked in"" it. Freakiest trip I\'ve ever had.\n\nIn general, it isn\'t a fun ""high"" it seems and it can get very confusing and disorienting even with two pills. Makes me sleep like a log tho.\n\nI\'m curious if anyone else has been given dicyclomine before and if the effects have been similar? My wife has taken one pill and hated the ""feeling of it"" and refuses to do it again; my best friend tried one too, and it put him to sleep but he said he had weird dreams, so I don\'t think it\'s just a ""me"" thing.'"

A month ago I started to have back pain that resides in my middle-lower back only when im laying down(sleeping). The pain comes in maybe about 2-3 hours while im sleeping and then ill wake up due to the pain after 5 hours. After waking up once i get moving the pain goes away slowly until i dont notice it anymore. To note, I had hip pain first (hip flexor i believe) from working out and have been diligent in doing stretches to relieve both pains in my hip and my back. The stretches reduce the pain but its still there. Ive taken advil and cbd since they reduce inflammation but i dont think it is inflammation due to the pain still being there. Using heat seems to work a bit, heat pads and ointments keep that pain down but still present. \n\nWhere is it:\nI would say T-11 to T-12 if I were to number the spine? It happens to be a sharp throbbing pressure pain. If I were to have the pain on and do yoga, it would hurt to be in a cobra position. Then after a couple of sets of the cobra and Im more active, the pain just dissipates and is gone. The back muscle feels fatigued and I do feel a certain pressure pain in that area when Im sleeping and 5 hours in Id wake up to the pain.\n\n\nHistory:\nIve never had any back problems arise before, and I have bought a Posture corrector, its quite nice since my shoulders are more rounded, I do get told that I slouch quite a bit due to having a big bones and wide shoulders. Ive been using it for awhile, my posture seems a lot straighter than before however the pain still resides.\n\nExtra: \nI tried 3 different mattresses and pillows to no avail, the pain still resides. As for the hip, it only hurts when I bring my knee to my chest if I was to lay down. I do stay pretty healthy, i gym 5 days out of the week. Not super heavy weight but just enough for some strain. Im currently at a loss and would like to sleep normally again. \n\nThank you for your time and consideration. Any help would be much obliged! '"

NSAID,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/nqubix/my_sciatica_journey_long_read/,b'My Sciatica Journey (Long Read)',,"b'Hey everyone! \n\nYesterday, I posted a picture of myself before I went through my microdiscectomy. The location of my surgery was at the L5-S1 level. I had been experiencing severe sciatica for about a year at that point. My back pain was minimal but since Im a college student, the sciatica was horribly impacting my ability to function on a day-to-day basis. During presentations in class, I would look squirmish trying to relieve the intense pain going down my left leg. Walking to class was also difficult and during social events, I would always be questioned by my friends as to why I would go lie down in bed. Eventually, I got coined the nickname old man for having back issues at the age of 20 (I thought this was actually a humorous). Because I know many individuals are going through intense sciatic pain and are also considering surgery, Im going to give you guys the outline of what I experienced over the past year. Warning for all of you that hate long reads, this is a long read! I have divided my journey up into months/significant events so skip ahead if youd like. If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask! Hopefully, this is informative for everyone and can give yall some insight! \n\nEarly May 2020 \n\nI used to be a pretty active guy. I would go on runs on trails about 3-4 times a week and run about 3 miles during these runs. After a run one day, I noted something weird in my left lower leg that I would describe as dull, achy pain. I didnt think too much of it since I just figured my muscles were acting up. Finished the day walking my 3 miles instead of running them. \n\nMid May 2020 \n\nThis is when I knew something was definitely wrong. I woke up one day from bed and couldnt bend over. My back pain ranged from a 9/10 to a 10/10. The pain would be relieved by lying down or when I would sit in a chair. \n\nLate May 2020 \n\nAt this point, I figured I had pulled a tendon or a muscle in my back. The pain in my back was slowly starting to get better but I noticed that when I tried to walk, there was more pain down my left leg. This was accompanied by feeling numbness and tingling down in my feet. I decided to wait it off and see if it would resolve on its own. \n\nLate June 2020 \n\nBy the end of June 2020, my severe back pain had almost completely gone away. I experienced some back pain when I would try to bend over but nothing severe like I had previously experienced. On the other hand, my leg pain seemed to be getting worse. I decided to take a visit to my primary care physician to see what was up. After doing research online, I began to suspect that what I was experiencing was far worse than a simple muscle strain or pull. My dad had a herniated disc in his 50 and suffered from sciatica. My mom also had back pain and sciatica but to a lesser degree. It became clearer that this might be what I was suffering from. \n\nFirst Doctors Visit Late June 2020 \n\nSince my leg pain was still severe and walking/running was almost unbearable, I went into the doctors office to try and get a proper diagnosis. After explaining to my doctor I believed that I had sciatica and had a family history of having bad backs/sciatica, I was ordered to get X-Rays and was prescribed a steroid pack along with a NSAID. \n\nMy X-Rays came back completely normal, revealing that my problem did not originate from issues with my bones. While the NSAID I was prescribed did nothing to help my leg pain, I found that the steroid pack helped a lot. Even though it made me feel lethargic throughout the day, it definitely helped to get rid of the shooting pains going down my leg. Despite the relief, I could feel something was still wrong with the leg/back. \n\nBesides taking medications to help alleviate my symptoms, I decided that sitting in bed all day waiting for my pain to go away was not going to help especially if my injury was what I suspected- a herniated disc pressing against a nerve. I took the initiative to walk as much as possible throughout the day since I wasnt doing much apart form a small-time commitment internship. \n\nLate June- Late July 2020 \n\nAt first, I approached exercise a bit too rough. I tried to run through the pain but realized that really aggravated my symptoms. I quickly switched to walking. Progress was very slow. Each week I would walk more and more until I was walking about 4-5 miles every day. The more I walked, the longer it took for sciatica symptoms to really make walking unbearable. \n\nWhen I was getting in form and feeling better, I decided to do a mix of both running and walking. At first, I would walk 2 miles, then run 1, then Id return back to walking. Three very interesting things I noticed during this phase. First, walking downhill was a lot more painful than walking uphill, likely because when youre walking downhill, there is more force pushing on the disc toward the nerve. Second, I realized that I could reset my pain by either crouching or finding a place to sit down for a few minutes. After I would crouch or sit, my pain would go away. Throughout my walks, I would do this when the pain got really bad. My final observation was that especially after doing long distances, the next day my leg would feel a lot worse. However, after a few days, I would let my leg calm down and the next time I would go to exercise, I would be able to run and walk further without severe symptoms. \n\nAt this point, I was still hopeful that I would be able to make a full recovery without doing more intensive or intrusive treatments. Exercising was an excellent way to manage my pain in a natural way. \n\nEarly August \n\nWith my exercise process providing my relief, I was excited to continue it and get as close to normal as possible. I was near normal by the end of July or at least I thought I was until I had to move out of the room I was living in and move into my new apartment. Unfortunately, this was huge mistake. I moved out by myself and was bent over most of the time picking up things off the floor and carrying heavier objects like my mini fridge. \n\nAn hour or two after moving into my new apartment, my back and leg pain went back to very severe. I was a bit pissed at myself because I knew that all of the progress I had made went out of the window. \n\nMid-August 2020 \n\nAfter making the poor decision of moving into my apartment by myself, I was in absolute agony and pain for the entire month of August. My pain was at its worst. Because orientation was starting up at my school for first year students and I was orientation leader, I was unable to try to exercise my pain back to a stable level. When I did walk to places around campus, my leg pain was so severe I felt nauseous at times.\n\nOne afternoon, after walking around campus for a bit, my pain was the worst it had ever been. It got so bad, I was certain that I wasnt going to be able to fall asleep. I made the decision to go to the ER that night to see if they could provide any relief. \n\nER Visit Late August \n\nYou would think that going to the emergency room because youre in so much pain would be the logical move. Apart from the huge amounts of pain in my leg, I was starting to feel shooting pain in my left groin area and it felt strange to pee. I was afraid I was experiencing Cauda Equina. Unfortunately, the doctors did absolutely nothing during my stay there to improve my state of pain. I was ordered a CT-scan by the doctor and also checked for abscesses in the area since I did have a previous history of suffering from abscesses in the upper buttock area. \n\nAfter waiting on my CT-scan results, the nurse came back and told me I had what appeared to be a bulging disc at L5-S1. Otherwise, all of my other blood work came back normal. What angered me the most was that when the doctor came to talk to me, the doctor said all my tests came completely normal. I asked about the CT-scan which the nurse had explained to me had found a bulging disc. The doctor said he had not seen that on my report which left me so confused. The doctor explained that there was nothing wrong with me and that I would be going back home. When the nurse came back to my room I told her what the doctor had said. Her reply was absolutely unacceptable- Sometimes he just doesnt listen. \n\nThe nurse was a bit more helpful in telling my next steps. While I was hoping to get an emergency MRI, she explained to me that I would need to go get one after my visit at the ER elsewhere. I imagine that the CT-scan cant pinpoint causes like an MRI scan does, which is why it was labeled as a bulging disc instead of a herniated one. Remember that the two are very different. Regardless, I left the ER feeling very disappointed and with no pain relief whatsoever. I wasnt even given steroids to help reduce nerve inflammation. \n\nSeptember 2020 \n\nWith school starting back up in a fall semester, I was extremely busy with my academics which caused me delay my appointment with a well-reviewed orthopedic doctor in my area by a few weeks. In addition to this, because classes dont require a lot of standing up, I wasnt miserable all of the time since I could sit down in chairs. (Big thing I realized here too- different chairs will cause more pain than others!).\nI finally went in to my appointment with an orthopedic doctor and explained to him my story of back issues/leg problems. At first, we did what my primary care doctor did. I was prescribed a steroid pack along with NSAIDs and muscle relaxers. My steroid pack worked once again but left me feeling extremely tired throughout the days. NSAIDs once again provided no relief whatsoever. Muscle relaxers also gave me no relief from sciatica but helped me fall asleep on days when the pain was pretty bad. They also left me feeling yucky the day after. \n\nMy second visit with this new doctor was when I was actually able to get a diagnosis. Straight leg test was positive on the left leg during his examination in both visits. He ordered an MRI and recommended I start PT to see if conservative treatment would help. \n\nPT and MRI Early October 2020 \n\nA lot of people had said PT had given them mixed results. The success stories I read gave me hope that I would be feeling a lot better after PT. Unfortunately, I can say for sure that PT did little to nothing to help improve my pain. I ended up going three times in November and had no success after a variety of different exercises (Cobra pose seemed to trigger my symptoms more). \n\nWhen my MRI report came back I felt validated when I looked at the images. There was a clear herniation at the L5-S1 level that looked pretty gnarly. After dealing with the issue for a few months, I was finally able to say that my issues stemmed from a disc herniation that was compressing the existing left nerve root at the L5-S1 level. All of my other discs looked good. \n\nDoctor Follow-Up Late October 2020 \n\nEven the doctor was a bit surprised that I was experiencing a disc herniation at such an early age. I was glad that at this point, we had come to the cause of all of my leg issues. After I explained to him that PT had essentially failed, our next step was to go to epidural injections. \n\nFirst Injection Late November 2020 \n\nMy first injection went excellent. After seeing this new doctor, I was a bit worried since he had pretty lousy reviews online. Despite this, after going through with the first one, I experienced solid relief from my sciatic pain. This was however did not last long. After one month, my leg issues came back; certainly not as strong as they were in August, but still strong enough to where I wasnt comfortable standing up or walking for long distances. \n\nSecond Injection Early March 2021 /Follow-up After \n\nI had to wait three months before I could get another injection after my first. I went in with the same doctor excited that I would get similar relief like the first one gave me. The second did not go as planned. Instead of providing relief, I experienced steroid flush for about two days and that was it. I was extremely disappointed.\nIn my follow-up I told my doctor that the injection provided little to no relief. At this point, given that my symptoms had gone on for nearly a year, he sent me to a surgeon to discuss possible options with him. \n\nSurgeon Consultation May 2021 \n\nAfter explaining to my third new doctor that my symptoms had not improved, he told me that surgery would be the next option. With this he explained that at my young age, more surgeries were likely in the future. I decided to go through with it, because in all honesty, Id rather have ten more years of a pain-free lifestyle and have an awesome time during my 20s rather than be the guy who always has to stay in bed or sit down because of a disc herniation. \n\nSurgery June 1st 2021 \n\nWith that, that brings us to yesterday when my surgery was scheduled! Everything was painless and the care I received was exceptional. One minute I was feeling calm from sedation medicine and the next minute I woke up in recovery! I have not felt any leg pain so far. The only worry I have currently is that I cannot support my entire weight on my tippy toes on my left foot, but I suspect that this will slowly improve as time passes! Currently prescribed with narcotics, nausea medicine, anti-constipation medicine, and Narcan in case I overdose lol. Back feels pretty achy and sore but completely expected! \n\nEnding Note \n\nHopefully, this was informative even if it was a bit long. Let me know if anyone has any questions about any point in my journey and Ill be happy to answer them. A lot of people fear surgery but going in, I felt is was my best option given my experiences. Ill conclude by saying that many people do warn others against it and sure, it isnt for everyone, but it is certainly better than living a miserable lifestyle where you cant do much! For all sciatica sufferers out there, it can be mentally draining to have to deal it every day but remember to stay persistent and hopeful that things will get better. Keeping your mental health in a good state is just crucial in my opinion to have a faster and more effective recovery!\n\n\nThank you all for letting me share my story!'"

covid,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/pvktnz/covid_vaccine_contraindicationswhy_are_doctors/,"b""COVID vaccine contraindications/why are doctors telling pts they can't get vaccine?""",,"b'So disclaimed to start with; I am not a clinician. I work as an epidemiologist and have my master\'s degree in public health/epidemiology. I\'m an epidemiologist at a large county health department and have been working on COVID response since the beginning. Part of my job duties is contact tracing, issuing orders of quarantine, policy-level guidance to schools, businesses, etc. and overseeing parts of our vaccine rollout. Thus, even though I am not a clinician, I know quite a bit about the vaccines and CDC/FDA/ACIP recommendations.\n\nMore and more often, I am seeing people claim they cannot get the COVID vaccine because ""their doctor told them not to"" or something along those lines. Most recently, I am working on implementing a vaccine mandate for our health department and some are claiming this. I also recently got into it with someone (outside of work) who wanted international travel advice and when I pointed out how selfish it is to travel internationally unvaccinated, they said their doctor says they cannot get vaccinated and I am being ableist.\n\nI\'ve basically got the CDC Clinicial Considerations Guidance for the vaccines memorized at this point [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html) and the only contraindication is an allergy to a component in the vaccines and even then, the recommendation is to vaccinate with mRNA if allergic to J&J and vice versa. But people are saying their doctor told them not to get vaccinated for a whole plethora of reasons--autoimmune diseases, pre-existing medical conditions, cancer history, etc. I figure one of three things has to be happening. 1.) They are lying. 2.) They misinterpreted something their doctor told them 3.) Their doctor is not following ACIP/CDC guidance.\n\nSo is there something I\'m missing or not considering since I am not a clinician that would preclude someone from getting vaccinated? Part of me wants to just call them out on their bullshit, but that\'s probably not the right response. In your experience, are there a lot of doctors actually telling their patients they cannot get vaccinated for reasons beyond those outlined by ACIP/CDC?'"

After numerous visits to the gyno and many different herpes swaps - they were all negative and so were the blood tests. Ever since - whenever I get sick or even have a yeast infection - they reoccur. \nNever had any GI issues either but ever since Ive been having stomach problems as well as stomach/esophagus ulcers. \nIn addition - after receiving my latest vaccine a couple months back i started having petechiae/capillaritis all over my legs that dont go away.

Im a 20f (52, 90 lbs) and for three years now Ive been in pain almost every time I eat.  A few minutes after I start eating, the center of my body (around the bottom of my rib cage, center and left) will start hurting.  It is somewhat relieved by laying down but not completely.  If I remain upright it will just get worse, and leaning forward with my knees up to my chest also helps some.  Along with this pain, I also feel full very early. If I force food down it will start pushing back up my throat.  I wont throw up completely. Sometimes Im in pain from eating one meal while simultaneously starving for the next.  The hunger pain is less than the pain from eating but Ive been force-feeding myself for years now so I dont die.\n\nIt gets worse as the day goes on.  I can sometimes ignore the pain from breakfast but after dinner, the pain will keep me up and sometimes I will wake up at 2 am, 6 hours after eating, with a lot of serious pain.  There will be a lot of bloating in my stomach and I have to force the air out to relieve the pain (burping is difficult for me to do).  Hours later air will still be building up.  I know the problem isnt purely positional since Im laying flat while sleeping.\n\nIts impossible to gain weight.  Im too sick to do anything but stay at home and force myself to eat but every time I gain a few pounds I lose them the next week when the issue flares up.  Im currently 90 pounds (I go up and down sometimes as low as 80, I cant get above 93 before falling again) and the only way I can stop from losing weight is by not being active.  Ive met with 3 nutritionists so I know Im eating the proper things, and my diet has always been healthy growing up.  Ive been eating smaller meals constantly in the day as advised by a doctor.  Before I got sick, I was eating about 4 meals a day, constantly hungry but with no issue eating. I wasnt gaining much weight then either but I didnt think much of it then.\n\nI also have POTS and celiac disease, but the celiac is well managed.  The celiac started this issue but when I went gluten free the pain never completely went away.  The POTS used to be well managed but the poor nutrition from my current issues has caused my POTS to flare 24/7 and that makes it impossible for me to work or attend college.\n\nIve been tested for gastroparesis and it came back negative.  We thought it was SMA syndrome for a while but that just got ruled out today when my upper GI series came back normal.  The gastric emptying study came back right on the line, inconclusive.  There is evidence of some problem: my stomach is much larger than normal (odd considering how little I eat) and it hangs down below the button of my pants.  While standing my stomach seems to have trouble pushing the contents up to the stomach exit.\n\nIve tried antibiotics to treat for possible bacterial infection but those just wiped out my gut biome and made the issue temporarily worse.  Hyoscyamine did nothing but make me more nauseous.  Gabapentin improved my appetite for a couple of weeks but then it stopped having an effect.  Nortriptyline is what I currently use to reduce the pain.  Im also taking propranolol and fludrocortisone to manage the POTS and those two medications have not changed in many years.\n\nIm running out of options and I dont know what to do to fix this problem.

It's complete non-sense and would harm patients if anyone implemented it (which no physician in their right mind would do). It keeps changing, so [here is a screenshot of the June 2021 version](https://imgur.com/a/0u0zbN1).\n\nI understand the desire to want to do something for these patients rather than just watch them deteriorate, but that doesn't mean we should abandon evidence based medicine and start randomly prescribing drugs with potentially dangerous side effects. \n\nLet's go through each of the components, and I'll grade them on a scale of 0-5 Quacks (in honor of the quacks that created this protocol), with 5 Quacks being the most harmful and least evidence based recommendations. Please comment below if you have better data for/against these therapies.\n\n1. Methylprednisolone - 1/5 Quacks - They started off strong with one of the only therapies that has been [shown to help](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2021436), I guess even a broken clock is right twice per day. Although they went wrong when recommending pulse solumedrol up to 250mg q6h (only 30X higher than the recommended and studied dose of dexamethasone 6mg daily).\n\n2. Ascorbic acid - 2/5 Quacks - Theoretical benefit at reducing inflammation, but data shows that it [does](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33576820/) [not](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33420963/) affect patient outcomes with COVID-19. But it's a water soluble vitamin, so relatively little harm compared to the other nonsense below. It's part of the Marik sepsis cocktail which has been shown [to](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2759414) [not](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2769467) [work](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776688).\n\n3. Thiamine - 2/5 Quacks - Again, part of the Marik cocktail which as per #2 does not make a difference for patients with sepsis. There is non-randomized and retrospective [data showing a benefit](https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-021-03648-9), although it's really hard to believe any therapy has a >60% mortality benefit for ICU patients with COVID-19. It's also water-soluble and likely of little harm.\n\n4. Heparin - 1/5 Quacks - OK, also not a terrible idea since there is a big risk of thrombosis with COVID-19. Most places are using higher-than-average DVT ppx for COVID patients and there is a low threshold for full anticoagulation. However recent data shows it is [helpful in non-critically ill patients](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2105911) but [no difference in mortality for ICU patients](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2103417) with COVID.\n\n5. Ivermectin - 5/5 Quacks - Now we're starting to get in to the crazy stuff. Unclear mechanism of action and potentially serious side effects. Everyone got excited about [a now withdrawn a preprint article](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-100956/v3) showing a 90% reduction in mortality with early ivermectin use. Again, does anyone really believe that any single intervention could have a 90% reduction in mortality with COVID-19? It doesn't pass the bullshit test. The often-cited [meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34145166/) (in which the above retracted pre-print article made up almost half of the serious COVID-19 patients) is also full of poor quality studies.\n\n6. Fluvoxamine - 3/5 Quacks - Not the craziest suggestion, but still lacking good quality evidence. There are some [anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet effects](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.652688/full) from fluvoxamine, mostly from in-vitro data. However there is some [human](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2773108) [data](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/8/2/ofab050/6124100?login=true) that it might reduce COVID hospitalizations if given early, but it still doesn't belong in a protocol for hospitalized patients.\n\n7. Cyproheptadine - 5/5 Quacks - The proposed mechanism is serotonin antagonism will help as an anti-inflammatory and an anti-platelet. No data to support this in COVID.\n\n8. Anti-androgen therapy - 5/5 Quacks - There is [pre-print data](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.20068056v2) that hospitalized COVID patients were less likely to be on outpatient antiandrogen therapy, but a [small RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34169042/) showed no significant benefit when given to COVID patients after admission. I guess the main benefit is that if these men survive COVID they will have less nocturia.\n\n9. Vitamin D - 4/5 Quacks - This has been [studied before](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1911124) for non-COVID critically ill patients and Vitamin D makes no difference. There is conflicting data on risk for COVID and VitD deficiency, but there appears to be [no significant association](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871402120301156?via%3Dihub). A mega dose of vitamin D 200,000 units [did not help](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776738) hospitalized patients with COVID. Not as benign as thiamine or VitC since VitD is a lipid soluble vitamin.\n\n10. Atorvastatin - 3/5 Quacks - There is some [poor quality](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13054-020-03154-4) (retrospective, observational) showing a benefit for statins but no good RCT data. Less potential for harm than the many of the other interventions listed.\n\n11. Melatonin - 2/5 Quacks - Supposedly an anti-inflammatory and [non-peer reviewed data](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.20213546v1) suggests a 87% reduction in mortality (?!?) for intubated COVID patients. Only 2/5 Quacks since the benefit on mortality is questionable, but I'm all for maintaining sleep-wake cycle and reducing delirium.\n\n12. Zinc - 4/5 Quacks - [Doesn't work](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2776305), but again not the most harmful intervention.\n\n13. Famotidine - 2/5 Quacks - Some early [observational data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7242191/) that famotidine was beneficial for hospitalized COVID patients, but subsequent meta-analyses showed [no benefit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7903022/).\n\n14. Therapeutic plasma exchange - 6/5 Quacks - The Marik crew finished strong with this one, there is no even half-decent evidence to support TPE for COVID-19. This also comes with substantial risks (HD-catheter complications like clots/infection, hypocalcemia, seizures, hypotension, etc)."""

Im breaking it up as much as I can to make it easier to read. \n\nSo I have a lot going on, and things Im trying to figure out about my body. in the last couple years Ive been struggling to find out what could possibly be wrong with me. in 2019, I got my annual physical and my WBC was 4.2, in 2022 it was 3.6, and in 2023 as of last week its 3.8\n\nIn January of 2020, I had a VERY nasty cold, almost like covid. after this Cold, I always got aches in the neck, periods of fatigue, and randoms pains all over my body. \n\nIn Early 2021 I got the Vaccine, In my chest near my heart, I would feel intermittent pulsing pain. several months went by and the occurrence of pain slowly went away. \n\nIn January of 2022, I start working in this old building that had constant water leaks. I developed conjunctivitis, as well as pain in my sides, constant headaches and neck pain. The first time I had ""filtered"" water in this building, I got really sick, so I stopped drinking it. In May 2022, I get my annual physical + STD tests and my WBC is 3.6...... Im freaking out thinking something is wrong with me, but my doctor assured me nothing was wrong. HIV along with every other tests they ran was negative. June 2022 I get Covid from my mom, and I develop pericarditis. I was hospitalized for 3 days, and I recovered just fine. a week or so after being released, I start developing pains in my chest under my heart, back of my neck and shoulders, along with Brain fog, and fatigue. Im thinking something is wrong with me especially my partner then cheating on me at the time.... So I get another STD test in August 2022 and everything comes back negative. He also got tested and his tests come back negative. They conclude my symptoms of pain and brain fog to be Long Covid Symptoms, which went on for a long time. \n\nI get tested this year June 2023, my WBC went up a little? its 3.8 instead of 3.6. Again, this year, all of my tests come back negative. normal kidney function etc. I recently quit working at the Library this past April. I haven\'t had itchy eyes since. I haven\'t had heart pains nearly as much. my breathing has slightly improved, minus me just getting over covid this past May. Covid this year was very mild, but lingered. nothing at all like last year. \n\nMaybe there was something at my last job affecting my health? Many other people at the building also complained that they were struggling with pains, itchy eyes, and stopped drinking the water from the break room due to it tasting ""off""\n\nI generally take care good care of my self. I work out maybe a couple days a week, I game ALOT, and I work 30 hours a week + school. I don\'t sleep as well as I should, but I am constantly working on that. I don\'t eat unhealthy either, I eat as much fruit and vegetables as I can. I will admit, I have days when I game all night and forget to eat. but again....

influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/fclhhz/corona_virus_prevention/,b'Corona Virus Prevention',,"b'Below is the most detailed description of the coronavirus Ive read. James Robb, MD UC San Diego, is a virologist whos worked with this virus for almost 50 years. COVID-19 has an affinity for pulmonary receptors that is extraordinary. Robb predicts the next 2 weeks will be significant. Newest info at end of his e-mail to his U of California staff & colleagues.\n\nSubject: What I am doing for the upcoming COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic\n\nDear Colleagues, \n\nAs some of you may recall, when I was a professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses (the 1970s). I was the first to demonstrate the number of genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human population (e.g., SARS, MERS), from different animal sources.\nThe current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be widespread in the US by mid to late March and April.\nHere is what I have done and the precautions that I take and will take. These are the same precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the mask and gloves.:\n\n1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.\n\n2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons, etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove.\n\n3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.\n\n4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.\n\n5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been.\n\n6) Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home\'s entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can\'t immediately wash your hands.\n\n7) If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!\n\nWhat I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US:\n\n1) Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas.\nNote: This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means that the air will not infect you! BUT all the surfaces where these droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon. This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs) The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth.\n\n2) Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!). This is the only way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific. The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.\n\n3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the appropriate sizes for your family). The hand sanitizers must be alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.\n\n4) Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY ""cold-like"" symptoms beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available.\n\nI, as many others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it. Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already been achieved. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic support is available.\n\nI hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic. You are welcome to share this email. \n\nGood luck to all of us! \n\nJames Robb, MD'"

That my vision is weird. One eye sees great far but terrible close, and the other eye is the opposite. Sees terribly far but good up close.  He said because of this, I don\'t need glasses yet because one eye compensates for the other but I might have neck problems later on. My off setting vision might cause me subconsciously to tilt and crane my neck in weird positions to try and see clearer. He was right, I did not notice how crooked my neck has gotten over time.\n\nI told all this to my nurse and she nodded like she understood and said off handedly something like **"" Ahhh.. I know.

Asthma (inactive) and seasonal allergies, bipolar II, anxiety, borderline personality disorder (I suspect the last may be misdiagnosed autism and am awaiting assessment). Frequent joint and neck/back pain for which I havent sought diagnosis. Currently taking 150mg Effexor XR, 50mg Lamictal, 1.5mg Klonopin, 500mg Metformin (not for diabetes), 145mcg Linzess, 900mg Neurontin (for the issue described below), 5mg Flexeril (PRN), and 100mg Celebrex (PRN).\n\nI have had a brain, face, and neck MRI come back clean, and the ENT noticed no symptoms of palsy. I am waiting to see a neurologist.\n\nSummary: I tweezed something from my hard palate, layers of multiple rugae peeled off, now have sense of laxity to left mouth and cheek and pulling/tension in the face.\n\nIts difficult to find a common thread in these symptoms, but timing of onset suggests theyre all somehow related to the original injury to the palate. Because of the areas involved, Im not sure what kind of doctor to see, and worry any specialist will disregard my concerns about the other areas affected.\n\n2017: Sharp protrusion on palate kept irritating my tongue, so I (stupidly) tweezed it. Mild bleeding and moderate pain. Shortly after (potentially unrelated), detected tissue poking out by the gumline near maxillary left premolars. Used my tongue to pull what felt like a wide, flat ribbon of tissue that felt connected to other thinner, more rigid pieces of tissue that snapped lightly as they were pulled.\n\nLate 2022: Tissue felt like it unwound over incisive canal, flattening cushy papilla. Most anterior rugae on left (prob what I tweezed) unraveled/peeled, followed by right. Picked layers off rugae at center of palate. Began experiencing episodes of dystonia in neck/shoulders, feeling of twisting in throat, trouble swallowing, indigestion, tingling in limbs, creaking neck, and traveling nerve sensations over head and face. The tissue on my palate would shift on its own at the same time. It sometimes felt like there was tissue pulling under my skin, both in the left side of the face and upward in my left nostril. I experienced heavy pressure at the right sternocleidomastoid and suprasternal notch, after which I noticed a vertical neck band. My face often felt internally twisted afterward, with my smile pulled in awkward directions (e.g. upward on one side and down on the other).\n\nI also experienced a heavy feeling to lower left face and left side of mouth, pain in the cuspids, coldness around the front six maxillary teeth, numbness in the lower half of the face and in the nose/to the sides of the nose, increased twitching throughout my face, weakness (to the touch) of left nostril sill, philtral ridge, and Cupids bow, and intermittent asymmetry (skewed right). The remaining attached portions of the rugae would often hurt from the pressure they exerted on one another and the weight of my lip, and have wiry-feeling pieces left holding the remnants in place. For a long time, I had a very sore, pulsing point above my left upper lip.\n\nNow/still: Persistent feeling of weakness to the left corner of my mouth and left upper lip, like it falls too far forward at the top, and often appears slightly lower than my right upper lip. It feels like the upper and lower lips dont meet fully at the left side. My left cheek feels like it tips out/isnt held toward the center of my face. I can move the fat pads in my left cheek into different resting positions relative to the underlying bones just by moving face; doing this too much and letting it settle leaves it feeling twisted internally. Lying on my back, I often get uncomfortable pulling at the sides of my nose. The tension I feel in my facenow all the way up to my eyesremits as I trace lightly with my finger from that point back toward my mouth, where the tissue along my gums and palate loosens. I can feel the tension shift places, traveling noticeably from the left to right side of my face (under chin or over/through nose); it feels like theres actual tissue moving. I feel tissue insert into my left nostril (sometimes makes it hard to breathe) and pull at the columella. Frequent headaches.\n\nOther notes: Twisting my finger in my left ear and nostril loosens or pulls the tissue in my mouth. When my left ear was especially tight, I experienced the sensation of something pulling from the back of my ear over the front; I could pause it with my finger. Experienced similar feeling off left nostril. Dragging finger down around left corner of smile turns left side into grimace. My left jaw has always clicked/been flexible, but never before caused problems.\n\nAny ideas are much appreciated. I am especially worried because the location on the palate and of the pulsing above my lip align with the nasalis and incisivus labii superioris. No one will touch my palate because the issue isnt visible, and is too fine to image via radiograph.\n\nPhotos in comment (under AutoMod).'"

One of my children now does, though.\n\nFuck...\n\nWe've known my sleep was broken most of my life. Identified at 11, though there were inclinations to it from 3 years old and on.\n\nBetween that gap, sleep would be periodic, inconsistent. Sometimes 0 hours in a 36 hour window, up to 8 hours, averaging 3 to 5 hours. By 11 it was a lot heavier. That's when I would start being awake for north of 72 hours between 3 to 6 hour sleeps. It got more severe the older I got.\n\nWe did all the appointments. Tried everything. We tried all the natural remedies first, but there was zero impact. Medical intervention and we tried EVERY sedative a doctor could legally diagnose to a child, including ketamine, amitriptyline, diazepam, pill form morphine. The drugs would work in decreasing increments. Dat 1 to 3 they'd get me 6 to 8 hours. Day 3 to 5 maybe 4 hours. By day 7 they were as ineffective as the natural remedies.\n\nBy 16 years old, we gave up the fight. I saw my mom breaking inside as she gave me a shot of whiskey with my sedative in hopes *something* would work. Because nothing else was and it was killing her that she couldn't help me, more than I felt it was effecting me suffering it directly. I remember the look on her face, the ethical inner debate of responsible parenting battling a need to help your child by any means necessary.\n\n17 to 22 was the worst. In an average 7 days I'd get 6 to 10 hours of sleep - typically at one end or the other, very rarely spread between days. The longest run was 10 days conscious, and I ended up hospitalized briefly.\n\nSomewhere around 23 something shifted. Dunno what, dunno why. But suddenly I was getting 1 to 4 hours of sleep every 36 hours or so. And I felt a LOT more functional. Sustainable even. And that's been my life for the last 13 years now.\n\nCoincidentally or not, that was the year my first son was born.\n\nThat's when I started wondering and worrying about the potential of a hereditary component. I'd argue with myself - it can't be, nobody else in my life or family line has it, and between various traumas and an ASPD diagnosis it makes perfect sense that mine would be conditional.\n\nMy oldest doesn't have it. He likes to stay up late/all night and think he's in the same boat, but then he'll sleep for 10 hours during the day. That's fine with me so long as it's not during the school year.\n\nAnd then his younger brother was born. He's 7 now. He's sweet, and kind, polite, he wants to be outgoing but is notoriously shy and reserved. Smart as can be, self-entertains well.\n\nAnd for the first year of his life he slept for 12 hours a day. And I thought all would be well.\n\nBut he hasn't slept more than 5 hours in a night for the last 6 years.\n\nIt doesn't matter what time he's put to bed, he'll either quietly lay there or eventually get bored and get up, play quietly in his room so he isn't disturbing anyone else. Eventually he'll fall asleep for a few hours. And then he's up again, self-entertaining until he comes to find me and we do our own things together until the rest of the family wakes up so we aren't disturbing anyone.\n\nSo here I am now. Wondering what the next 20 years together might look like. My heart aches for him knowing what might happen, but hoping that it corrects, or I can help him find ways to cope with it better than I did if not.\n\nI don't know what to do. And there's no way I can until we cross those bridges. But I'm glad to have the experiences with it I have to try and find our next steps."""

Where else to turn but the internet for answers (quite dangerous I know. After I had Covid-19 this year (January) for the 1st time I had a lingering cough for a while that went away. Then around March, I started to have a Sore or tender breastbone with a slight urge to cough. The pain is just more slightly to the right than in the center. I went to Urgent care for them to do an ECG and they found nothing. I went to my General Care and I have been treated for Allergies, Asthma, Gerd & Costochondritis.

Any questions you have I will answer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright everyone, As you know I went to the Cardiologist yesterday and got the news. Apparently its called **pericarditis** and it commonly happens after infections like covid-19. However I have a long term form known as Chronic Constrictive Pericarditis as most cases only last a 4 to 6 weeks this can last from 3 months to over a year. Its easily treatable by Taking NSAIDs like Max strength Ibuprofen to reduce inflammation to allow the heart to heal, but some cases but rarely require surgery if severe scarring has occurred. I am going back today for a Cardiogram so my cardiologist can see if there is any long term damage (He doubts it as I am young and healthy). Thank you everyone for your ideas and suggestions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate 4/5/23\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs requested here is another update. As of now, I have gone through several other tests such as a barium swallow test, upper endoscopy, and chest x-rays. After further investigation by my doctor after reviewing all the data she has come to the conclusion that I have 2 separate problems. 1st is the chest pain she believes that covid has caused some long-term damage that has produced moderate asthma made worse by my stressful lifestyle, she has switched inhalers to albuterol sulfate 90 mcg which has been helping with the issue. As for the Burning throat, we are still going with GERD. However, my body is really only reacting well to famotidine 40mg tablets. I have had little to no results with anything else (omeprazole, esomeprazole, Pepcid, Pepto, Tums, ETC). I have been on this new medication as of 03/09/23 and have seen improvements in my energy and pain relief. I am now able to go outside and be active for extended periods of time (About an hour of light to moderate physical activity). I would say I have improved by around 50% to 60%.

Sleeping 16+ hours but it\'s never enough.\n\nAfter having only my trusty old antidepressants for a month, and simultaneously worrying/annoying the ever-living hell out of my friends and family with my high energy and erratic decision making, I\'ve been told to try Quetiapine.\n\nMind you, the reason I\'m trying this is because my psychiatrist came to the conclusion that I could not function on Celexa and Antidepressants, but they seemed to be the most stable combo so far.  \nHas anyone used antidepressants and Quetiapine?\n\nThe side effects look scary, and because I\'m not a mental health professional (but I am a professional people pleaser) I\'ve generally just been doing and taking whatever my psychiatrist says. The signal cut off when he told me the name of the new meds, and I didn\'t even know what a \'Quetiapine\' was until it was handed to me. What got my hypomanic little mind spinning was that as the pharmacist handed me the bag she looked concerned.\n\n*""Are you sure you want to take these?""*\n\nFor an antipsychotic that sounds like a starter pokemon, I didn\'t expect that reaction.\n\nAnyway, enough rambling. Basically I would just love to hear people\'s experiences with these meds, especially if you tried both.\n\nI think I\'m gonna hold off on taking them until I can contact my psych again, so I can grill him about what exactly he\'s giving me and why.\n\nBut in the meantime, I hope there\'s someone out there who can relate, or even advise me :('"

It feels like theres scratchyness and itch in my throat and Im scared it could be cancer for some reason. The thing Im most scared about is the shortness of breath.

Please don't read if the topic of the title is triggering for you.\n\nI know this is wrong and can go south really fast. I've had bipolar 1 for around 7 years. I haven't had a full manic or hypomanic episode in almost 2 years, and a depressive episode in 1 year. I've been medicated and in therapy for almost 2 years as well. For many reasons, I started purposefully triggering myself into hypomania. Obviously I won't say how I am doing this. And yes, I'm still on all my meds.\n\nThe biggest reason why I'm doing this is because after getting severe COVID last May, despite always masking and staying up to date on my COVID vaccines, my chronic fatigue and brain fog has become way worse and my motivation has become nonexistent.\n\nI already have many chronic illnesses. Ever since last May, it's been impossible to take proper care of myself and I've only been showering around once a week. Before I got COVID, I showered every day without fail. I know, it's gross and I hate it. My doctor doesn't have any answers. I have no symptoms of depression. I just am always so exhausted and have no motivation to do anything. I've only been leaving my house every other week for therapy.\n\nSo, because I'm so sick of being chronically ill and not living my life, I've sent myself into hypomania. I know this is very toxic and a bad thing to do, but I couldn't help myself. As long as I stay hypomanic and don't go into full mania, I'll be happy. My 4 medications have been doing a great job stabilizing me.\n\nI've been hypomanic for the past 4 days and have been so productive, clear headed, and extroverted. I've been out of the house every day, taking better care of myself, and cleaning my space. Yesterday I decided to get 3 new piercings. The constant fidgeting, restlessness, and feeling tense is annoying, but it beats just laying in bed exhausted all day.\n\nI know eventually I'll have to message my psychiatrist and get my meds adjusted, but for now, I'm enjoying life in a way I haven't in a long time. I can do anything I want because I have endless motivation and energy.\n\nHas anyone here been dealing with long COVID? I've been feeling so alone in this before becoming hypomanic."""

Once I stood up I had a metallic taste in my mouth, my heart was pounding, I was shivering, sweating, and my pupils were dilated.

I started to feel less weak but I developed shortness of breath where I could not take a satisfying deep breath. This lasted for months. I had 2 pulmonary function tests done and my breathing capability was normal.\n\nJun 2021 - I would still get a rapid heartbeat occasionally when going upstairs or running, etc. Also while still dealing with the problem of not being able to take a satisfying deep breath I started getting a dull pain under my sternum that would come and go and would feel better if I crossed my arms against my chest and applied a bit of pressure. This is what I would do to fall asleep when it was bothering me.\n\nEnd 2021 - Started taking omeprazole daily but it didn\'t seem to help at all. I started getting touch tenderness around my belly button. The stomach pain/discomfort has gotten worse. When moving around my stomach pain seems to get worse. Laying down made it more manageable.\n\nMar 2022 - Went to the ER one day when it was incredibly uncomfortable and the pain kept me in bed.

The sinusitis pain was much worse than the COVID headache and was the worst pain ever. My GP who did a PCR test on me refused to prescribe antibiotics and also refused to give me a sick note, despite his clinic being located 5 mins walk away from me. My employer was threatening to deduct my pay because of no sicknote and I was terrified of losing my job. I had also recently moved to a new country where I don't speak their language. \n\nA few days later I started having pulsating chest pain at the base of my sternum. I went to the ER but they wouldn't treat me or give me antibiotics because I didn't have a vaccine pass on hand. My GP was ignoring my phone calls all day and on the odd occasion they answered they blew me off, so I started looking elsewhere. The sinus pain was torture and after calling almost 20 different doctors I secured an appointment on short notice where I was given antibiotics some days after the sinus infection started.\n\nAll this is to say that I was under an incredible amount of stress, pain, and fear that surpassed even the stress of losing a family member in the past and other serious trauma.\n\nAfter recovering from covid I went to another ER where they did an xray, ECG, and echocadigram which according to them were all fine except that my ECG indicated a pattern that was characteristic with young athletic people. The young ER doctor said despite the ECG result it was normal for my demographic. The only thing they found was anemia. \n\nThe chest pain continued and a month later, the first cardiologist I saw diagnosed me with myocarditis with 30% LVEF visual and her hospital ER came to the same conclusion albeit 35% visually. All other cardiologists have gone with this initial diagnosis.\n\n1. Based on my backstory and my MRI result from three weeks later shown in the images, in your expert opinion and as a doctor, do you believe I had myocarditis like they said or was it a heart attack? I read that an MRI can tell the difference between a myocarditis scar and a heart attack scar. \n\n2. If you think it was a heart attack, how is it that it caused scarring when from what I know, a heart attack causes scarring because a blockage prevents blood from reaching parts of the myocardium? I did not have any blockage since my D-Dimer was always below the limit. Troponin has also always been below the threshold. \n\n3. Which is worse, myocarditis or a heart attack?\n\n4.

Im writing to see if any of you are willing to share management regimens that work for you, successful treatment experiences that you have had, or any relevant stories youd like to share. \n\n\nCurrently Im taking Senna Plus Tablets (docusate sodium 50 mg & sennosides 8.6 mg) once a day and fiber gummies (2-4 g soluble & dietary fiber daily). I might increase the Senna to twice daily per doctors orders because Im still not having complete bowel movements and only going twice a week. I also have Miralax but dont usually reach for it because have never really found it to make a difference. I have magnesium oxide 500 mg caplets that I used to take that were somewhat helpful that I might add back into my pill organizer. \n\n\nWhen I was on clozapine things were so bad I was going maybe once or twice a week. I happened to be admitted for an episode where I mentioned these issues and they took an abdominal x-ray and were horrified at the state of my colon. They wouldnt admit me to the unit until they could make me have a bowel movement as I was basically on my way to almost being impacted. They gave me magnesium citrate (which might be the most disgusting thing ever), senna, and a suppository and threatened to manually disimpact me if that didnt do the job. Yikes. Thankfully sometimes later some of the worst cramps in my life finally got things moving. After an exhausting hour in the bathroom - they were pleased and admitted me to the floor. \n\n\nThey kept me on twice daily senna and I was able to go normally for close to a month. Then things fell into their old patterns again and Im so frustrated. I did stop taking the senna at some point and dont want to have to rely on it.

Dunno if it would be worth shifting things around and increasing the lithium to see what happens. Ideas ideas. \n\n\n**TLDR**; Anyways - talk to me about your struggles with psychotropic drug induced constipation and what has worked for you.

I thought that the teeth continue to mature with the hardening of enemal untill birth\n\nThey argue that there is paucity in the evidence on dental staining and enamel hypoplasia given the administration time and lengh in in utero and length of antibiotic course.\n\nAlso that Doxycycline has a lower affinity to chelate to calcium and are different to those of tetracycline s.\nmy husband and I have perfect teeth ,I have no fillings at age 40 and my son age 8 has perfect teeth and was a breastfed baby who's baby teeth were perfectly normal as they can through the gumline.My other son age 2 nearly 3 has perfect teeth.We as a family have very good oral health.No family problems with teeth  .My middle child with the Doxycycline now age 6 has sufferd endless traumatic and grueling procedures to rebuild her back teeth .4 teeth that broke apart whilst brushing and they continue to say caries.Along with 3 At the front\n\nShe has had to go through countless dentist appointments .my child will continue to suffer I will not stop fighting for justice for her.I have not involved the press but I am now at a point that I am thinking I might.And let the world know what Doxycycline does and can do at five months pregnant in eutro.I also want to add that when she was born she had small tiny white flecks on each of her fingernails no bigger than a pin head.this I believe as we k ow Doxycycline bindind itself to calcium.my other 2 children born did not have this. and would be so very grateful in any knowledge or comments or thoughts or experience s you might have as we are fighting so very hard.pleasr help  as we really need your help.\n\nHer teeth will soon Tobe tested under pathology to prove her case.Any information on this I would really appreciate  .justice for my little girl Quona .I failed her for taking this drug ,I can not fail her case for her solisiter.

What would a good er do for me if i went in for benzo wd? What would i want to avoid saying, or what should i say to facilitate the best treatment? I\'ve been feeling pretty helpless in the matter over the last few weeks. If i had completely run out i would have gone in already. But even trying to taper on my owni feel like its a problem that\'s almost out of my control.\n\nThere\'s one hospital in particular that i know of that the staff has treated me with respect and all-around good beside manner. I had hernia surgery there about 5 months ago. I\'ve been using benzos for a few months again. Gone through wd\'s in the past. Last time(about 18 months ago) i actually thought i might die bc i had GI problems before i began using them...and by day 1 of cold turkey(if i remember right) i was coughing up blood and shitting blood(pretty sure that was due to bleeding ulcers that had been going on for some time). There were times i believe i had stopped breathing at night. My entire body would convulse at times when just lying on the couch. And i had a slew of other wd symptoms. I\'m a 33yo male and though young have cold turkeyed off of benzos and opiates many times; but i feel like I\'m getting ""too old"" to do that any more. I didn\'t know if the er would just write me a script for valium and send me on my way or?? I\'m currently down to about 15-20mg valium/day. I\'ve been down to this amount for the last few weeks but feel stuck as though my body cannot handle going any lower. At the peak of my usage i was taking possibly the equivalency of 100mg valium/day; but spread out between valium, xanax, and pressed bars(pressed with what benzo i don\'t know). \n\nI know that I\'m dealing with more than just benzo wd as i believe i caught covid about a month ago, then after that passed i believe my ulcers came back. I\'m eating practically nothing but plain oatmeal. I\'ve lost 20lbs at least. Even when ive taken some valium and tramadol(have been in pain mngmnt getting the tramadol) and tums ill still have such bad gnawing/burning pain that feels like ulcer pain i believe...and it will even radiate to my back in various areas. I\'m kind of at a loss for what to do. I called my dad(lives out of state, we aren\'t close, but i have literally no one to talk to) to tell him what was going on, i saw my gp 2 weeks ago but she subtly refused to help in any way(even though a good portion of what I\'d been using had been saved up scripts from her in the past). I was thinking of ordering rc\'s but i don\'t really want to fuck around with any of that as I\'ve never done that before. I don\'t have any friends with any connections anymore(at least none that will admit to having any connects for rx drugs). Hence I\'m thinking of going to a good hospital to see if they will treat me.\n\n Any one with experience that can weigh in on the matter for me? Thank you for any help that you guys/gals can provide.'"

Very slight occasional use of alcohol and weed, socially. I currently take lanzoprazole, vitamin B12 and D3, oral mesalamine, microgestin, duloextine and that brand of ibs meds called IBgard (I think it's peppermint/menthol???)\nSo in April of this year, I noticed two separate times that my urine came out dark in the morning. Like dark brown. Afterwards it resolved though so I ignored it and went on with my life.\nFast forward to beginning of September, the dark urine is back again and much more frequent. It's every day/every other day and happens multiple times in the day. I don't experience any pain or burning, no increased frequency of peeing, and my pee smells normal. No fever or back pain either.\nStill I emailed my primary care with my concerns and was instructed to give a urine sample and blood test. Blood tests (cmp) came back totally normal, but urine came back with high leukocytes, WBC, bilirubin which led my doc to think that it's a UTI. prescribed me macrobid which I just started.\nWhat's strange to me is that I've HAD utis before and they presented with the classic symptoms of burning, strong smelling pee, urgency etc. I'm not feeling that right now though, just DARK brown urine. What confuses me further is today my urine culture came back negative. What the hell is going on??\nWould appreciate any thoughts, similar experiences, etc. I'm going to continue taking my macrobid and seeking further guidance from my doc but I am a little worried that something else is going on ://\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: so I took my full course of macrobid and nothing improved. On top of that on two separate days I've had some really weird allergy/common cold symptoms like indigestion, runny nose, feeling run down, no appetite....no fever though. I just emailed my doc about it and she confirmed that b/c my urine culture was negative that it was NOT a UTI and she thinks it's dehydration.  Why the hell am I feeling like this??? I really don't think it's dehydration, I drink a lot throughout the day\nEDIT/UPDATE 2: So it's been a bit and don't have much of a clearer answer for my other symptoms. HOWEVER, I did get a proper diagnosis for the dark urine. After seeing a nephrologist, getting more kidney function tests done + a kidney biopsy, they diagnosed me with IgA Nepropathy.

I called my regular dentist first and the prescribed Penicillin VK and Tylenol #3. I made an appt for mid September to be seen by specialist but my pain kept getting worse.

Fast forward to recently it's still there, I visit the doctor for a unrelated issue and mention the leg and back pains. The doctor said it sounded like sciatica and prescribed some pain medication. In the end I didnt grab them from the pharmacy due to the pain being minimal. It was just an inconvenience. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, woke up as per normal, had a shower then I was drying myself I raised my left leg onto our bedroom couch and in that split second an immense indescribable amount of pain got sent through my entire body. It felt like someone had stabbed me or shot me in my lower back. Suddenly the feeling in my left leg and lower back was multiplied by 1000x.\n\nI called the emergency services, and they told me to call my gp, called him and he thought it may be was a muscle spasm. Prescribed some codeine and referred me to the physio service which takes 4 days to do so. \n\nSince yesterday I have barely been able to walk without excruciating pain, extreme difficulty going for a wee (takes around 2-5 minutes for it to start) and have been in so much discomfort its left me bed bound. This morning I went for a number 2 and it took me 30 minutes of trying, the more I pushed the more painful it was. I dont think I was able to 'fully' go. I had wind trapped in my stomach all night from being unable to pass it unless I really push. I'm concerned soon I may have bad constipation. \n\nI've called the doctor again today because I'm really worried. From my research I feel like I experienced my disc herniated or the disc slipped in this single instance. The pain runs severely from my lower back all the through my left leg to my foot. \n\nMy question to you guys, what does it sound like to you? I'm not one to self diagnose but I feel like if I know I can describe the pain better to a specialist.\n\nIs a muscle cramp the same as a herniated disc (assuming not). Why was I feeling pain in the area for the last 2 months now and what happened yesterday that multiplied that to a 10 on the pain level? \n\nShould I be patient and wait to feel better or push to be seen by a specialist? \n\nMany thanks, and I feel you for what you are/have gone through."""

Any advice/tip helps.',,"b""See TLDR on the bottom. Here's long story:\n\nHey guys. My soy allergy is pretty nasty. This last happened 3 years ago. I mean it's not as nasty as say, the poor folks out there who get the extreme life threatening reactions, but they suck. I know for a fact it's gonna be 2 weeks of basically never-ending adrenal state. Like panic attack. Hypersensitivity to pain and cold. Aggression, out of nowhere for no reason just, I am angry. I am irritable. I hate life.\n\nSo, this was snuck into cough drops by **Kroger**. Watch out, they did not list the soy oil ingridient which I then found on the government website. Anyway, I had four of those suckers before waking up with a panic attack, and a slew of other symptoms. **Insomnia, indigestion, headaches, body aches, pain in left side under ribs, rash (only on right side of the body, like, deep cystic kind but it passed after 2 days yay), neck stiffness, and yes like I said 2 weeks of emotional misery to follow**.\n\nNow, the only things that alleviate these symptoms appear to be stimulants (My adhd medication), so basically either taking my daily dose and getting a little relief for a few hours (Oh yeah, this allergy makes all my meds work really badly), or being incredibly doped up **on all my anti allergy meds. I'm talking claritin**, **benadryl** (together), double dose **Ketotifen** for my MCAS. I'm taking **pepsid** for stomach pains with which I wake up and with which I go to bed. Yes I already have mast cell issues so, that's great! I found **probiotics make this issue worse** (CLogged ears, mind fog), but ease digestion and SIBO.\n\nAnyway. I need to know, does anyone out there know how to get this horrible soy out of my system? I will do anything. I will take extra laxatives, I don't care if I lose weight/minerals/etc, this is hell.\n\nI will drink enough water to be nearly dehydrated if I have to pee it out. WIll CREATINE help? Will anything help? Please. Please tell me. What supplements, minerals, workouts, saunas, soaks, anything just. I've already done the activated charcoal but since I caught it late, doing it 12 hours after the poisoning was unfortunately worthless.\n\nTLDR:Undeclared allergen poisoning, but just GI and mental symptoms with some skin/rash. How do I get soy out of my system faster? What supplements or drugs can I take or ask the doctor for? I'm already on a mast cell stabilizer and several H1 and H2 antihistamines. Any advice helps. THank you!  \n\n\nUpdate 6/14/23 Smooth move/laxatives help. Activated charcoal didn't do anything because I took it too late after soy ingestion. I feel much better with laxatives and I feel like hell constipated (more than usual), so, I guess if you want soy out of your system, lax it out x\\_x"""

How dare that bitch take my fucking high. I made sure she knew it too. \nIm an ungrateful little shit worried to death that my son may be damned by my decisions and way of life. \nBut all of this thinking brings me right back to point A.\nI wish I could believe that one month sober means no more for keeps! But I dont fool myself. Ive been in this familiar territory and there wont be any surprises. \nIt will get better? Oh , ok. Yea guy, sure!\nSuboxone helped me steer half ass straight.

I have done an Xray, ecg, breathe tests which have been normal and my blood oxygen has always been normal during this period on both my portable finger detectors and the clinic ones. And my breathing doesnt sound bad when doctors have listened to it because I dont have much weezing it is mostly the bad chest tightness whenever I try and take deep breaths and the shallow breathing leaving me frequently short of breath or feeling like I am fighting to breath with something heavy on my chest when it is at its worst.

I saw my pneumologist yesterday and told her I was still having issues. She perscribed me more prednisone (7 days of 30mg per day) but said that she really did not want me taking it unless I absolutely needed to since the potential for negative side effects was real and because my breathing wasnt too bad based on her assessment despite the issues I was reporting to her. She instead told me to just increase my dosage of my daily inhalers and check back with her in a few weeks.  \nSo what should I do in your opinion? Would it be harmful to my body to take this much prednisone, 3 5-7 day runs of it in the course of a single month? Has anyone here ever taken prednisone for long stretches of time?

I tried Nasacort at my doctor's recommendation but IMMEDIATELY had horrible side effects, so now I'm trying Flonase.\n\nI just did my second day of sprays about half an hour ago and I know it takes up to two weeks to notice any sort of positive change but both times so far it feels like it's made my postnasal drip (which is my worst and most aggravating allergy symptom because it contributes to a constant cough you know how it is) worse. Way worse. I feel like I'm drowning in mucus. \n\nI'm using it correctly, only putting the tip of the nozzle in, angling it away from my septum, sniffing GENTLY while I spray, not angling my head, etc. But somehow it still finds its way down my throat. It goes like this: I use the spray, everything feels great for a minute or two, PND starts going wild, a few minutes later I can taste the Flonase dripping into my throat. Cough ensues.\n\nIs it just.... like this in the beginning for some people? The other meds alone aren't cutting it although they've helped some. I definitely need some sort of nasal steroid, and the Nasonex would be ideal because the Asmanex is making a huge difference but I can't afford it out of pocket even with pharmacy coupons, but gosh this is rough I just want to feel better! It's been YEARS of constant PND at this point, years of constantly coughing. I'm doing all I can to reduce allergens in my home and take care when I'm outside and while it's nice to KNOW that I'm indeed allergic to things, it's so frustrating!\n\nIf anyone can offer their experiences, or encouragement, or anything, it'd be deeply appreciated at this point.

The only reason for the APS diagnosis was extremely low  platelets (6k), APS antiboides, triple positive, and the fact that a  platelet infusion only brought them to 8k. I responded great with dexa  (x5 days) and predinsone (3 months) with Cellcept (MMF) which I\'m still  taking (2g/day). I also take a bunch of other medications (baby aspirin,  vit D, fenofibrate for triglycerides, which caused the pancreatitis  (2900+), and some psych meds: wellbutrin, pregabalin, clonazepam,  desvenlafaxine, and Ubiquinol and pre-probiotics as supplements). No  clots so far.\n\nThe problem is, I\'ve  felt cold (a sensation which starts as regular coldness and then turns  into some weird sensation which seems unbearable) in my head, face and  arms for about 3 months now. It didn\'t coincide with any addition or  substraction of any meds or supplements. No hypothyroidism, all tested  electrolytes in normal range, not anemic. Vit D normal levels now.\n\nI  don\'t know whether the main cause is psychriatic (anxiety/depression?),  metabolic (recent prediabetes diagnosis, on metformin now, though this  happened after the coldness started) or nervous system related (no  idea), or something else.\n\nI used  to smoke 15-20 cigs a day (I stopped for a year and am now at 4-5, but I  do vape a lot). I\'m obese (BMI 29-31), I walk 5000 ish steps a day  (some way more, some way less). My mother and sister have Lupus and  fibromyalgia, and my uncle had RA.\n\nThis  feeling of coldness begins whenever I wake up, (9-11am, sometimes 2 or 3  pm) until like 6 or 8 hours later. If I don\'t take or do anything, it  is literally unbearable and prevents from working, studying,  socializing, etc. However, both exercise and/or high doses of pregabalin  (300-450mg) plus clonazepam (3-6 drops) reduce it. Eating an excess of  food (whether iti be soup or pizza) takes this sensation away completely  for 2 or 6 hours respectively.\n\nAlcohol, 4-6 regular beers, also gets rid of it completely for 2-4 hours.  However I was instructed not to consume any alcohol bc of the  triglyceridemia. And I also don\'t want to become addicted to alcohol.\n\nAnyway,  my rheumathologist and psychiatrist think it might be some sort of  dysautonomia (I have no other symptomts of POTS, dysautonomia or CFS, I  did have fatigue but resolved with wellbutrin).\n\nMy  endocrinologist thinks it is because I have hypothyroidism (only because of positive and high TPO antibodies and borderline low T3, and  symptoms, even though thyroid US came back normal).\n\nI  think it might be related to brown fat; different types of cortisol  released while/after eating, or something else related to tissue  metabolism. Perhaps low T3 (I know it has no official diagnostic value).  I have noticed that both my face and scalp get hotter when I feel cold,  to the point where I get a low fever reading with my laser thermometer  even though I get a 36.4-36.6 reading with the armpit one.\n\nThis  sensation is horrible and is making me not want to do anything other  than vegetate for the firs half of each day.

A PCP mentioned long covid, but thought it was a less fruitful path as they said the treatment options are not well established or known.\n\nThere are some suspicions of some diagnoses, but my providers have been reluctant to jump too quickly as that changes how they\'re able to care and get prior-auths.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can provide images of anything requested, as well as provide levels for anything or explicit notes.

Around two months ago I started breaking out. I've always had mild acne, but over the course of a few weeks my entire face was covered with acne and red raised skin. I went from almost no acne to both of my cheeks, chin, and hairline covered with the stuff. My routine for the past 2 years has been regular 2% salicylic acid wash, but once my breakout began I started to use a 10% benzoyl peroxide wash. At the peak of my breakout, (around the first week of this month) I finally went to a dermatologist, and ended up getting a laser treatment to bring down my swelling, and a culture on my acne to make sure it wasn't a staph infection. I was prescribed [acticlate](http://www.drugs.com/mtm/acticlate.html) (oral 75mg), [sumadan](http://www.drugs.com/pro/sumadan-wash.html) (sulfur) wash, [ziana](http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-146309/ziana-topical/details), [aczone](http://www.rxlist.com/aczone-gel-drug.htm), and [clindamycin phosphate](http://www.rxlist.com/clindamycin-phosphate-topical-solution-drug.htm). The routine given was:\n\n> Morning: Sumadan wash, aczone, and clindamycin (then moisturize).\n\n> Before bed: Sumadan wash, aczone, and ziana (then moisturize).\n\nLast week my culture came back negative for staph. I had done this routine for 3 weeks and I didn't get the slightest result. I was hopeless and started to experiment. Two days ago I abstained from the topicals (azone, clindamycin, and ziana) and only stuck to the sulfur wash and acticlate (plus moisturizer). Ever since then my swelling has gone down at least 70% and I'm not getting any new acne. \n\nIt's worth mentioning I'm allergic to penicillin, amoxicillin, and  a range of other antibiotics. Is it dangerous to suddenly abstain from my topicals? Am I allergic to my topical creams? My skin hasn't been this much better in at least 50 days. My eating habits haven't changed (I eat fairly healthy) and I'm a runner (20+ mpw) so I drink a lot of water.\n\nI'm going to a new dermatologist soon due to a few problems I had with the former one who put me on these medications.\n\nSo my overall question(s): is it bad that I'm suddenly not taking my prescriptions anymore? Am I possibly allergic to them? Thanks in advance."""

I vape. I have (mostly dormant) asthma, seasonal allergies, bipolar II, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder, though I suspect the last may be misdiagnosed autism (awaiting assessment). I deal with joint aches and hypermobility, and neck and back pain, which may be related to EDS-HT, though I lack family medical history necessary for diagnosis. I currently take Effexor XR (150mg), Lamictal (50mg), Klonopin (1.5mg), Metformin (500mg not for diabetes), Linzess (145mcg), Neurontin (900mg for the issue described below), Flexeril (5mg PRN), and Celebrex (100mg PRN).\n\nI am dealing with the feeling of hypermobility/lack of support to the left side of my mouth and face. I have had brain, face, and neck MRI come back clean, and two doctors have told me the muscles in my face are functioning normally, with no signs of palsy. I have an upcoming appointment with a neurologist.\n\nThis is a strange issue from what Ive gathered after multiple visits to different dentists, ENTs, periodontists, oral medicine specialists, and general physicians. I have been told a research center/university is my best option, but I still worry they will not be able to help me, as I have already visited one university. I am constantly told there is nothing that can be done by an oral surgeon, as there is nothing visibly wrong with the tissue on my palate; I have also been told radiograph does have the capabilities of seeing the sort of detail I describe and can feel with my tongue, which is frustrating.\n\nI cannot definitively say whether this is one or multiple issues, but the timing of the onset of symptoms and what feels like reciprocity between sensations in the face and mouth makes me think they all originated from the same injury. The areas affected also make it difficult to discern what sort of physician is ideal to seeI have been told ENT, oral surgeon, and plastic surgeon.\n\nIn 2017, I had a tiny but sharp protrusion on my anterior hard palate (near the left lateral incisor and cuspid) that continually bothered my tongue. In frustration, I pulled at it with tweezers. (Yes, I know this is stupid.) I have no recollection what the protrusion ended up looking like, but there was moderate pain and mild bleeding.\n\nShortly afterand potentially unrelatedI detected tissue poking out by the gumline near my maxillary left premolars. I used my tongue to pull at it constantly until I had a noticeable length of what felt like a smooth, flat ribbon of tissue that ran near the gumline toward the central incisors. At certain points, it felt like it was connected to thinner, more rigid pieces that lightly snapped as they were pulled out of place.\n\nIn late 2022, the tissue that formed a relatively cushy papilla felt like it unwound vertically towards the foramen, leaving a flat and narrow covering over the incisive canal. I have been informed the tissue covering the palate is a continuous sheet and cannot unwind, but I can only explain what it felt like. I also realize this likely means what feel like ribbons or fibers to me are likely either torn tissue or areas where the tissue has fused back together more thickly.\n\nShortly after, I noticed a heaviness and fullness to my left jaw and cheek, followed by pulling sensations in the left half of my face and intermittent asymmetrymostly of the base of the nose, philtrum, and mouth, which all seemed to noticeably skew to the right.\n\nI experienced occasional episodes of dystoniatense neck, raised shoulders, chin toward shouldersaccompanied by sensations of light tingling that traveled forward over the head (a horizontal line of tingling that covered the face) and face or inward from the sides of the face (a vertical line). It made my eyelids flutter as it passed. I also experienced tension on the ears, a sensation of twisting in the throat with trouble swallowing, the feeling of indigestion, and was left with a temporary grinding sound when moving my neck. Sometimes with these episodes, I had the sensation of some layer below the skin of the face moving, as if being peeled, once with the sensation of membrane/tissue peeling upward in my left nostril. I also experienced the feeling of something taut slipping inward over the right sternocleidomastoid, followed by intense pressure at the suprasternal notch. I developed a vertical neck band on that side.\n\nWhile I discounted this in the past as my imagination, I will add I experienced (more than once) the feeling of a line of pressure or tissue move from behind my left ear, over the edges, and down the ear into the face; I could pause the movement with my finger, and it was sensitive when passing the tragus. I experienced a similar sensation of a band pulling off my left nostril.\n\nI was often left with the feeling my face was twisted."" Manipulating my face with my hands helped lessen the sensations in my face. The left and right sides of my mouth felt pulled in opposing vertical directions when smiling, e.g. right side up and out, left side down and out. When smiling, I am still able to run my finger from just above the upper left lip to below the lower left lip and my smile will turn more into a grimace on that side and hold position, while it remains a smile with similar motion on the right side.\n\nI also experienced pain in the cuspids, coldness around the front six maxillary teeth, numbness in the lower half of the face and in the nose/to the sides of the nose, and increased twitching throughout my face.\n\nBecause I pick at my mouth with my tongue without thinking, I continued to pull on the annoyingly out-of-place tissue in my mouth. The aforementioned ribbon felt like it would pull across my palate, causing pain on the left side. Eventually, the layers of one of my left anterior rugae/ridges began to peel (I suspect the lateral end is where I tweezed), followed by the opposing ridge on the right. There are what feel like wiry pieces left around the little remaining tissue of the left ridge, which can feel painful. While anxious, I also pulled some of the tissue from central ridges further back on the palate, which was immediately followed by the feeling of a million pinpoint-like pressure points in the apples of my cheeks.\n\nHere is a link with photos \\[[LINK](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AmSwXdv0nG9tjC8nHbsOcN40AQQE?e=5jFqJg)\\].

In addition to wellbutrin and zoloft. I feel like this is a little ridiculous for a 29 year old man to be taking five pills a day just to function as a normal human person.

Shouldn't I just be able to eat better, exercise, drink more water and handle it like that? What the hell did people do 100 years ago before there was a psychiatric diagnosis for any and every single friggin' personality quirk or nervous tick? It just... I don't know, man.

The next day i woke up and it was much worse,i couldnt eat on the left side of the mouth so i took some nimesulide that i found around the house. When it started to get dark outside my pain got very bad,i took some dexketoprofen this time. Nothing worked,i tried warm salt water and brushed my teeth a couple of times,i didnt sleep at all because of the pain. And that brings us to today. I didnt felt so much pain in my entire life,its not inflamed and there is no visible problems with the tooth,the pain is inside. I went to the pharmacy this time and i explained what is happening,i got some ibuprofen and solpadeine extra that i need to take for the next 2-3 days until i can get to a dentist,at the moment i really cant because i live in a small town and the towns dentist is gone for a little bit. The only thing that the ibuprofen and solpadeine do is numb the area a little bit for about an hour,the pain becomes a little bit milder but it comes back quickly. I was told that i should only take solpadeine 3 times a day max,its understandable since it contains codeine. The pain is so extreme and i am willing to do anything at this point. Please help me somehow. I am 16 years old and this is too much to handle for another 2-3 days. \n\nedit: i dont drink or smoke\n\n## '"

Curse the fact that this is the most efficient way to spread infectious diseases.\n\n10am - One patient tells me he knows the truth about coronavirus. I give him a Tdap booster. He becomes autistic in front of my eyes. Hell never conspire against me again.\n\n11am - Tend to the secret hospital garden of St. Johns wort and ginkgo leaves that we save for rich patients and donors. \n\n12:30pm - Pick up my briefcase of money from payroll, my gift from Pfizer for the incomprehensible profits we make off of the free influenza vaccine given every year. \n\n1pm - Conference call with Dr. Fauci and the lab in Wuhan responsible for manufacturing viruses. Tell them my idea about how an apocalypse-style zombie virus would be a cool one to try for the next batch.\n\n2pm - A patient starts asking me about getting rid of toxins. I ask her if she has a liver and kidneys. She tells me she knows the truth about Big Anatomy and that the only way to detoxify herself is to eat nothing but lemon wedges and mayonnaise for weeks. I give her a Tdap booster.\n\n2:45pm - Help the FBI, CIA, and CDC silence the masses. Lament the fact that I can only infringe on one or two of their rights. Oh well, theres always tomorrow.\n\n4pm - One of my rich patients begins to crash. Laugh as I realize Ive mismatched her spirit animal and zodiac moon sign. I switch out the Purple Amethyst above her bed for a Tigers Eye geode. She stabilizes. I throw some ginkgo leaves on her for good measure\n\n6pm - Go onto YouTube and see coronavirus conspiracy videos everywhere. Curse my all powerful government for how inept they are at keeping people from spreading the truth\n\n6:10pm - Go onto Amazon and see that a book about the truth is the #1 seller this week. Question the power of my all powerful government. Make a reminder to myself to get more Tdap boosters from the Surgeon General next time we talk. \n\n7pm - Time to go home. Before I leave, sacrifice a goat to Dr. Fauci and say three Hippocratic Oaths.\n\n9pm - Take a contented sigh as I snuggle under the covers made of the tinfoil hats of my enemies, realizing that my 4 years of medical school and 3 years of residency training have been put to good use today.\n\n-\n\nCredit given where it is due: https://www.facebook.com/1555110237/posts/10217399602852760/?d=n"""

Two weeks later I started to feel dull ache when eating, stiff jaw, pain radiating from tooth/ear/etc. Went back to dentist and they recommended Endo. Went to Endo who said no infection was visible yet but there was a small spot and widening canal. Endo did RCT through the perm crown and completed with permanent filling. Healing for first week was great. Now its two weeks out and Im getting the same jaw pain, with a bit less pain in the tooth than before, but same pain radiating up the jaw and down neck. Pain is not severe, can ignore it. Havent taken advil to treat yet. The pain is worse at night after chewing and talking all day. Some days I dont feel anything, sometimes it comes for an hour or two. Ive noticed sensitivity all around my mouth since the RCT. \n\nContext: I grind a lot and have TMJ. Thats how I cracked my molar. I wear a night guard that is ill-fitting (waiting for replacement) but I figure its better than nothing. Endo could not see crack on normal or fancy x-ray. Made no comment about crack when going through the crown for RCT. In his eyes the RCT was successful. Two different dentists tested for VRF, and found everything normal. \n\nShould I be concerned? Can TMJ prolong root canal healing? Is it possible re-infection? Im ready for the saga to end and feeling so much anxiety.'"

It involved my bowel *in case that matters.* I had cysts on the ovaries but never tested with PCOS or pre-diabetes, but my current ob-gyn says the recurrent cysts are enough to diagnose PCOS and that my self-reported panic episodes may actually be hypoglycemia and a sign of prediabetes.\n\nHe told me to take berberine- because he takes it with fewer side effects than metformin. He is an insulin-dependent diabetic. \n\nAgain- I have never had a blood test or glucose test come back with prediabetes. My #s are typically 100 on the nose when I spot test without fasting, and it was 101 on a blood test taken literally 20 minutes after I ate a happy meal. On that same test, my triglycerides were very high, I think near 300, but I also had just had a soda. It wasnt a fasting panel. \n\nHonestly, my diet is prettyeh. I eat a good amount of sugar and carbs- so I wasnt surprised my cholesterol was high (but not enough to warrant medication or a follow-up). I also dont know if it was accurate since I had just eaten.\n\nI guess my question is this about the berberine- If I take berberine and do have hypoglycemic episodes, will it make things worse? \n\nThere is a chance that I\'m just having anxiety attacks- In my history, I watched an ex go into ketoacidosis and have a grand mal in the ER- the ""hypo"" or ""panic"" episodes were very severe after that. I also developed what we think was cushing\'s syndrome *not disease* related to a steroid shot around that time. I gained 60 lbs, fat on neck and back, moon face. No treatment was given for that. That was in 2011.\n\nTreated the PTSD, and now these dizzy/need to eat issues are much less common. However, since my PTSD is medical, and not just from that instance, I have seen that it is flaring again. I\'m in regular therapy.\n\nAnyway, I feel like I have to give that background to give the full picture.\n\nI know that it could be a sugar swing, but the lowest I\'ve -ever- tested was around 72. That issue also seems to clear up if I exercise or just wait it out.\n\nThe highest sugar level I\'ve had was maybe 142 after eating. I certainly could test again, I did pre-hysterectomy as I was trying to get my dad to check his blood, and it was 97 when I ""spot-checked"" myself. It\'s also worth noting that these episodes of anxiety or hypoglycemia, whichever, happened frequently after the hysterectomy for a few weeks until they boosted my estrogen- I had one such attack in the office where it felt like I ""needed to eat,"" but literally more like a fight-or-flight thing. I have never fainted or passed out. At the time, they said it was a normal panic attack from my hormones being imbalanced.\n\nShould I push for testing before accepting that I  may be ""prediabetic? Or is the PCOS/hysterectomy/endometriosis thing enough to suggest that prediabetes is coming or already here? I am going on hormone replacement therapy and need testosterone as well- which I know could change how my body works, too. \n\nI don\'t want to refuse or refute everything my doctor is saying, but he\'s pretty old and I\'m worried about doing supplements rather than pharmaceuticals that have been well-tested. I also have been a medical guinea pig for years, and I don\'t feel comfortable being told I have a condition without definitive proof. \n\nThoughts?'"

I feel like all of my tension in my body relaxed five minutes after I took it. \n\nI have a tendency to carry my anxiety in my muscle, but right now I feel completely free of the stress that usually ways on my body. \nI am excited to see if this newfound experience with Ambien will continue as gabapentin slowly leaves my brain.  \n\nBut so far I am finally satisfied with how this makes me feel. I just took a warm bath. I have a galaxy projector in my room and a heated blanket chat laying on my chest all while feeling so like warm inside. \nYeah I could get used to that.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: shard to do editing, but if it as Im trying to read it right now, I dont think it makes much sense. I guess Ill find out tomorrow..l no mmmm'"
covid,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tjgb4t/marijuanaalcohol_wellbutrin_and_depression/,"b'Marijuana/alcohol, Wellbutrin, and depression.'",,"b'So in December, I was admitted to a mental hospital after developing psychosis. I only had delusions, no hallucinations. They ruled out schizophrenia, and left it at marijuana induced (I have a medical card). Although, fitting the timeline, I received a Covid vaccine and was hit hard with Covid a week later right before all of this. I did research into what other reasons cause psychosis and Covid/and or the vaccine actually has caused psychosis due to neurological damage from the virus. I have always struggled with anxiety and have been on Lexapro for the last 6 years. Although, nothing could prepare me for the withdrawals I had when stopping Zyprexa. I reached a point where I had an existential crisis which lead to existential depression while trying to recover. Im a person who hyper fixates on things, so of course I couldnt stop thinking whats the point of doing anything. I lost interest in literally everything. I was prescribed Wellbutrin which helped me out of bed, but did not let allow me to just relax outside of work. I used to love movies, video games etc, now I cant even enjoy those things without being in my head about how much I dislike everything. Im curious though, Im stopping Wellbutrin today and have been switching over to Buspar and Lexapro combination. While on Wellbutrin I couldnt get drunk or high no matter how many shots (10+ within a few hours). Im definitely not going to continue that habit, but was curious if anyone else had this issue and did it resolve once stopping Wellbutrin. I dont mind living a simple life, I have a good girlfriend, good family, good job and live in a small town in Oklahoma. I own a gym, so some of my hobbies are lifting weights and doing yoga. But I cant obviously do that 24/7, I need to be able to turn off my mind and watch some television or game. Im hoping once I start being able to smoke again, Ill be able to start enjoying the relaxation of video games and television. Also, how is Buspar? \n\nTLDR: had psychosis, developed existential depression. On Wellbutrin but I cant get high or drunk. Will that resolve when stopping? Also, how was Buspar for your obsessive thoughts. \n\nAlso if anyone wants to share their story, or relate, feel free to use this thread '"

meloxicam,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/jkoosc/just_venting/,b'Just venting..',,"b""Sorry for the long post. Feel free to stop read comment. Haven't really posted but feel like I don't have many people to talk to. \nI started a new job at a Wal-Mart Distribution Center. And I'm working weekends, well its Saturday thru Monday 5am til 2:30 pm or whenever we finish. Because its in a warehouse, and i barely talk to anyone, so it's really nice. I work in a freezer and have1 to build a pallet or 2 depending on trips. Amd everything people are around me I get so anxious and want to stop working bc I don't want to make them wait too long to get to a certain slot and I don't want to be in the way. I hate when they just stay behind me. I hate thinking that they just watch me work. Even though in reality they most likely don't care at all. But my mind tricks me everything into thinking they are. \nOne time. I literally had a supervisor asking me about a slot, when you get to a slot of you finish whats on one pallet you pull the empty one out and put it on your pallet jack and then start the 2nd pallet thats behing it. My supervisor apparently said that someone else behind me said I didn't grab it and picked from the one behind it. But i know I didn't. And I said that. And they just continued to say I can get fired for that. I literally wanted to start crying. I could feel it all building up and just said okay. And he told me to go back to work. The slot that still had boxes on it and I never check to see if it was taken off a back slot. I just wake what I need. So I never know. Am I supposed to check every slot to make sure. Lole thats ridiculous! And like I hate that so many people leave empty pallets there and don't move them until I do. The rest of that day I literally kept crying when no one was around. My tears froze to my face mask and all. It was so bad I can't afford to get fired. And I hate to think that everyone keeps watching me. \n\nI started back on effexor xr 75 mg and 50 to 100 mg of trazodone to sleep. I also take Mirapex for rls, meloxicam for headaches which never works and they took me off Buspar bc I felt it didn't work. But I still feel so anxious and hate feeling like I want to die. The first couple days I just felt foggy and I literally called off work a few times bc of it. And then on top of that I always wake up with these major headaches I don't know what to do. I know that these other medicines will take time to work. And the only reason I was off of anything for so long is bc I missed my last appointment last year d/t being in a car accident and I was super scared to call back so I never did. The only reason I had an appointment with my doctor was bc they scheduled it when I was at the emergency room for me while I was there for my asthma and a respiratory infection. So he asked me all these questions bc my weight dropped drastically by 40 to 50 lbs and asked why I never called back and why I stopped taking stuff and I couldn't take it and I literally started crying bc I hate being at the doctors telling him all this. I couldn't get any refills without going to the psych and him checking in with me and going to therapy.. and it just endiled up getting 1000 times worse over the next year And especially bc after that car accident I got even more depressed and so anxious i didn't even want to drive anywhere. At this point I was only here bc if I left my 5 year old son would bc stuck with my ex and I couldn't do that to him. \n\nMy boyfriend on the other hand told me that he didn't realize I got this bad. I just felt like I couldn't talk to him bc everything I would bring up he would just feel like it was his fault and its not. And he just doesn't know how to listen without getting upset or doesn't understand how to comfort me when I'm feeling that type of way about things. He always just gets super depressed and just makes me feel even worse whenever I try to talk about anything that bothers me."""
cyclobenzaprine,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/wtt9l4/shoulder_pains_for_over_a_week_doctors_ive_seen/,"b""Shoulder Pains for Over a Week, Doctors I've Seen Give Conflicting Answers, Looking for More Opinions?""",,"b""About over a week ago, I woke up with severe, unending sharp pains in my left shoulder. Moving it or keeping it still didn't seem to make a difference. The paun was so intense that I felt it in my neck, making the left side of it feel stiff. I put a heatpad on my shoulder, which did nothing, and then took an Aleve, which did very little. After an agonizing 10 hours, I took a Naproxen (had leftover pills from a back muscle spasm a year before) which helped tremendously. But the pain was so bad, I had to take off work.(Not that I could do my job anyway, lifting 40-60lb cases of alcohol)\n\nI had gone on a vacation over the weekend with my girlfriend, during the period of which I took two naproxen and two cyclobenzaprine (also from the back muscle spasm) a day to dull the pain. While there were no sharp pains (save for one morning) it was a dull ache for the entire time. This feeling continued long after into the week, and seemed to shift from my entire shoulder, to front of it, back of it, and even what felt like under the bone of my shoulder.\n\nI went to see a doctor in Urgent Care on Monday, in which I tried my best to describe the pain. After a while, they had said that I probably had Bursitis, but would need to see an orthopedist to check if it was a heart attack. (PRETTY sure it wasn't.) They gave me a sling, but I wasn't using slings, as the angle it held my arm at was quite painful to me, and still is.\n\nOn Thursday, I went to the Orthopedist. He seemed to be rushing me along, as he kept cutting me off as I was trying to expain the feeling in my arm. Nothing regarding a heart attack was further explored. During said visit, I was asked to push my arms outward against his pushing inward, and found my left arm had difficulty pushing against his, which he commented on. He came to the conclusion that I either had a pinched nerve, or I tore a tendon. He wants me to do an MRI scam to make sure.\n\nI stopped taking naproxen/cyclobenzaprine on Friday, because the pain has now dulled to occasional flashes depending on how I move or hold my arm, and said pain is bearable, for the most part. But there are muscles in my upper arm and shoulder that feel tightened no matter how much I relax, and the arm feels stiff, and cracks occasionally when moved. Moving the arm makes this feeling worse, resting it at certain angles cam either soothe or irritate it further.\n\nI have no idea what's up with my arm anymore, and the local medical center (which doesn't have a very good reputation, I should add) hasn't really helped. I'm going to talk with my primary physician and see another orthopedist for a second opinion, but I wouldn't mind a few MORE opinions."""

The CDC considers you a high risk group.',,"b'Hello friends. \n\nIm half delirious pls excuse me but I needed to share. Im a medical student but I cannot give medical advice here. \n\nIf you get COVID and have ADHD (diagnosed by a psychiatrist with symptoms beginning in childhood) reach out to your doctor in the first few days of symptoms about Paxlovid. Its two different antiretroviral drugs that make it harder for the virus to replicate in your cells. ADHD is one of the conditions on [the CDCs list of groups at high risk for severe COVID.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html) When I saw this I thought for sure that it must have been a typo. \n\nBut then I found [Merzon et al 2022. ](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/10870547211003659)\n\n>\tWe found that that having COVID-19 infection in patients with ADHD was associated with more severe symptoms and an increased rate of referral to hospitalization, even after accounting for variables known to increase the risk for both disorders. It is of note, that in this cohort, ADHD was as a strong predictor for COVID illness as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases, and much stronger than obesity or asthma. It is suggested that ADHD is by itself a risk factor for severity of COVID-19 illness\n\nI want to caution that this is a correlation not a causation and was in 1800 Israelis and more data is needed. [Heres an article ](https://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/home/topics/adhd/adhd-is-associated-with-greater-covid-19-symptom-severity-and-hospitalization/) that uses more laymans terms I think. I dont like what this article suggests at the end. I personally dont think being so distracted you dont wear your mask accounts for it being *a stronger predictor of disease severity than freaking obesity.* But whatever Im keeping my theories to myself. \n\nPLEASE LISTEN TO YOUR DOCTOR NOT THE INTERNET. This drug is not perfectly safe and because of the way its metabolized in the liver it theoretically interacts with a buttload of drugs. You may not be able to take it with kidney or liver problems. \n\nI promise Im not sponsored in any way I just want people to know because I sure didnt. There hasnt been time to teach doctors about this. Im literally in the emergency room every day and I barely knew about Paxlovid at all. I assumed it was for elderly people and those with heart disease. \n\nAs always please be careful. Get vaccinated. Get boosted. People arent going to get tested like they used to so numbers seem low. Even doctors have stopped wearing masks as rigorously outside of work. I didnt have any classic COVID symptoms like cough or fever. Just a really really horrible sore throat and joint pain. They stopped testing everyone coming into the ED and so it looked like number were low. Just be safe. \n\nOk hopefully that made sense Im going to drink some nightquil and sleep for 12 hours.\n\nEdit: I realize I said antiretroviral but I meant antiviral. Its because part of Paxlovid is also used in HIV treatments and COVID has my brain scrambled\n\nEdit 2: love it when my ADHD wakes me up at 2am and I cant fall back asleep despite being exhausted. Just love it.'"

If you\'re young, athletic and motivated like me, it really takes a toll on you. \n\nI know exactly how HORRIBLE this feels and this is why I\'m writing this. \n\nIf a single person reads my success story and feels a bit better, then I will be happy. \n\n**This is not medical advice**. \n\nI will describe my own experience in length, what worked and what didn\'t, but I am not a doctor. Beware: Back pain and sciatica are large industries. There are NUMEROUS vultures willing to suck your wallet dry while wasting your time with treatments that do you no good, or worse, cause you harm. It is highly likely that you will be required to dodge a number of such bullshit-fused bullets before you\'re completely healed. \n\nYeap. I said it. Completely healed. You WILL be completely healed.\n\nI did, and you will too. \n\n**Here\'s my story:**\n\nAugust 3rd, 2017 I injured my back deadlifting on the gym. I was pretty strong, back then, and I felt like I was Superman. I had been dealing with minor lower-back injuries - many family members do - since middle-school, so I didn\'t sweat it. \n\nI was back in the gym two days later trying to push through the pain and working out as normal.\n\n**Lesson 1:** \n\nDon\'t be dumb, like I was. If you\'re injured, let it heal. \n\nI am pretty confident that THIS was the day I fucked up my spine, and not the day I deadlifted. This has been confirmed by a physical therapist and two orthopedics. \n\n**I repeat: If you\'re injured, let it heal. Listen to your body.** \n\nSo, my lower back balooned with inflammation. After four days or so, my left leg started going numb. Numbness quickly devolved to pain. EXCRUCIATING pain. The type of pain that turns Superman to a crying, malnourished, lost 9-year old girl. The type of pain that haunts you for months after. \n\nI was literally carried to the Emergency Department of a hospital, where they prescribed me Arcoxia & Norgesic (potent anti-inflammatory and muscle-relaxant/painkiller respectively). \n\n**I passed out at 11 am next morning. Didn\'t sleep a minute through that first night.** \n\nFast forward a few days, a neurosurgeon I was sent to pointed out I had: \n\n*  Significant muscle weakness on my lower leg. \n\n*  Loss of sensation to a big portion of my foot.\n\n* The usual neurological suspects: Tingling, needless, cramps and the like. \n\nHe told me I\'d probably need surgery or I\'d risk permanent damage, and he prescribed me an MRI. \n\nThe MRI showed I had 2 two minor disc herniations and a third one, which had f***ing exploded. A big portion of disc ""gel"" had been ruptured off and was fixed on pressing my sciatic nerve. \n\nI was given methylprednisolone (corticosteroid) and told I should have surgery soon because that would NOT heal through conservative treatment - to do otherwise would risk permanent damage. \n\n**Well, let me tell you, this was inaccurate. I healed.** \n\nI decided not to undergo surgery after fact-gathering and lengthy personal research. I learned three things:\n\n*  Over the long-term patients that have been operated on and those who opted for conservative treatment have, on average, the same level of healing. \n\n* Huge disc injuries, like mine, were FULLY capable of resolving themselves much like the smaller ones. This is called disc-resorption, for anyone that is interested. \n\n* Each spinal surgery increases the risk of future surgeries. Given my age, I was pretty much guaranteed to have fusion surgery down the road - which is not really on my menu. \n\n**So, what did I do?**\n\nI visited NUMEROUS other doctors and health experts. Now, I have to be honest with you. I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the health-care industry. 9 out of 10 people don\'t give a shit about your health. \n\nI will give you three examples that highlight my horrendous experience: \n\n1.  A physical therapist I visited accidentally re-injured me with his elbow during manual therapy. He told me that it was somehow my fault, and he had nothing to do with it. I was in bed for around 2 weeks due to this.\n\n2.  An orthopedic told me I should get vitamin B-complex injections. These are supposed to help with nerve damage repair. Well, they only work if you\'re deficient. I was not. In fact, after getting blood work done, I saw I was above-limit. \n\n3.  A quack told me I should do his few, magic ""healing stretches"" that would ""re-align"" my life. Needless to say, mere stretching was not the answer - I will get into that later - and his stretches had nothing unique about them. \n\nI am getting carried away. \n\nSo, after spending MONTHS pursuing shitty hit-and-miss treatments, this is what actually worked for me:\n\n**From pain-management to functionality:**\n\n**1. Walking:** I set a goal to walk 5 miles per day. At first, walking was limited inside my home but I slowly built on it, dilligently. \n\n**2. Sciatic nerve gliding:** Youtube that shit. There is not strong medical evidence, but it helped me. It might help you. \n\n**3. McGills Big 3:** Google them up. I know enough about fitness to understand how to intelligently progress these into harder versions. I would slowly increase difficulty every third day. \n\n**4. Vitamin C & D:** 2000 MG & 3000 UV daily respectively. Might have been placebo. I saw a few studies claiming these help, they were cheap, so I tried them. \n\n(*Only after significant discomfort had passed*):\n\n**5. Daily stretching:** I stretched my calfs, my soleus (look it up), my hamstrings (bent leg), my quads (important), my glutes (piriformis too), my hip flexors. I would also do the McKenzie spinal stretch. \n\n**6. Strengthening all the aforementioned muscles.** LIGHT exercise - all following well-structured protocols. I found the site sportsinjuryclinic a great resource in this. I found treatment protocols for EACH problem-area I had and followed them like a zealot - e.g, achiles tendon rehab, hamstring sprain rehab etc. Of special importance, I found, was strengthening the gluteus medius muscle - google up the exercise ""clams"". \n\n**7. Progressing to harder core exercises.** Ab wheel, leg raises on the pull-up bar. Being more active - i.d, more walking, light upper body work. \n\n**Now, let me share the things that f*d me up:**\n\n**1. Pressure on my nerve.** Whether it was manual therapy, tight jeans, sitting on an uncomfortable chair, too much exercise, streching too much, my foam roller - or, in cases where I was really vulnerable, merely walking - this lead to complications. I\'d usually start going numb and hurting. DON\'T overdo it, whatever it is you are doing.\n\n**2. Cold.** It\'s pretty cold where I live. I\'ve noticed this to have a significant effect on my sciatic symptoms. Try and stay warm, whenever you can. \n\n**3. Too much medicine.** Did nothing, or worse, it masked my condition by covering the symptoms. This lead me to overestimate my health and complicated the situation numerous times. Use it when you need it. \n\n**4. Laying on bed.** I\'ve experienced SIGNIFICANT muscle atrophy on my legs throughout this journey. I attribute this to the fact that I spent too much time laying in bed, during periods of great fear and discomfort. Fear is your biggest enemy in this, I swear. Stay as active as possible without hurting yourself. This is a fine line, but you can find it if you go looking for it. \n\n**5. Dr. Sarno\'s preachings** - and any other feel-good goofy mental treatment. Now, I am a logical person by nature. This might work better for you if you\'re emotional, but I wouldn\'t bet on it. Although I imagine there is a psychosomatic component in this, trying to address this mentally did not work for me. If anything, it got me overthinking and paranoid. \n\n**6.

corticosteroid,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/e02yql/bad_longterm_cystsacne/,b'Bad long-term cysts/acne',,"b'I\'m hoping to get some answers here, as I\'ve tried OTC acne treatments, numerous antibiotics, anti-fungal creams, corticosteroid creams, and numerous other medications.  \n6-7 months ago I began developing bad breakouts on my back, face, chest, and arms. In fact I actually developed a cyst on my gum but it was short term and hasn\'t come back.  \nThis problem persisted and continued to get worse, I began getting huge cysts on and behind my ears, then my jaw, neck, chest, penis and back. I developed a huge one in the crack of where the lord split me.(butt) It was painful but popped and went away, since then hasn\'t occurred again. However they are reoccurring on my face,ears,back,chest, and neck. They are painful and when popped will ooze a clear liquid and feel as if air is coming out or almost like deflating, if that makes sense.  \nThere is no smell to the clear oozing liquid. They get significantly large in size, become red and inflamed, and significantly painful. They last anywhere from a week to 3 weeks sometimes longer before disappearing but as soon as one disappears, another one or two take its place. They seem to reoccur where old ones had been, this isn\'t the case always.  \nGenerally they scab up making me look like I am using meth, it\'s so bad I have given up dating since they began and it has steadily grown worse. So much that some-days I don\'t want to leave the house to go to work or the store. I don\'t like looking in the mirror and especially hate taking pictures because these annoying cysts have lowered my self esteem so much.  \n\n\nI\'ve had blood work ran numerous times, no STD\'s, and all the results ""appeared to be normal."" 5 years ago I was hospitalized for MRSA infection and still have a huge scar from where they had to cut my shoulder open to drain, flush, and pack the wound. I was in there for 7 days.  \n\n\nHere\'s what I take.  \nI was in Pain Management for years because of several disc issues in my back. L4/L5 the worst and C-spine. After my daughter was born I began using kratom and left pain management.  \nI have taken Kratom without breaks for almost two years which as you can imagine has increased my tolerance exponentially... I can take an OZ a day generally a little less but sometimes more. I don\'t measure my doses I just load a big old country tablespoon up and toss/wash. It has helped my pain, my IBS-D, my PTSD, ADHD, and anxiety.  \n\n\nI\'m on two prescriptions right now, which I have been on almost my whole life. One being relatively new at a year but I rarely take it.  \n(1) *Adderall* (**DextroAmphetamine**) **30MG IR 2x daily** (During the work week I take it 2 times daily but on weekends I take anywhere from 1 to 1.5. I\'ve been on this since I was 6 or 7 years old and been on it continuously.   \n(2) *Librium*  (**Chlordiazepoxide)** **25MG 3x daily** (This is the one I rarely take.. I actually probably have about 200 pills from left overs if not more.)  \n\n\nOTC medication/supplements  \n(1) Ibuprofen, motrin, advil etc. (Not everyday but atleast 2x a week.)  \n(2)Tylenol or BC-Powders (Atleast 1 to 2 times a week, I try to avoid these.)  \n(3) Level-Up- Mushrooms LVL:Max (Just started these this week. 3 capsules at night. Chaga,Lions mane, and Cordycep mushrooms)  \n(4)Kratom (Daily usage, heavy doses-At least 2-3 tablespoons at a time. 4-6x daily)-My family thinks its from kratom.  \n(5) Energy drinks such as Reign and Bang which contain BCAA,Creatine, taurine, caffeine, CoQ10. I\'ve stopped consuming this but on general I was drinking 2-3 daily. It\'s been at least 3 days since I have switched to coffee and the cysts appear to be getting better and skin is clearing up. However it\'s done this before right before it hits me hard. \n\nI also vape but do not use drugs or drink. However the few times I have drank my skin started to clear up, kinda weird isn\'t it?  \n\n\nI\'ve used 80-90% ispropyl alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, Salicylic acid 2% Skin pads, zapit and other zit/acne creams.  \nI\'ve tried atleast 5-8 antibiotics ranging from Penocillin 500 2 or 3x daily, cepholexin, doxycyline, etc.  \nCorticosteriod cream for the inflammation. I have tried a lot of home remedies such as taping a cut potato to sit overnight on the cyst, putting castrol oil on it before bed, charcoal scrubs, etc.  \n\n\nI\'m 23 years old, have a good BMI and good weight (5""11 or 6""0) weighing 153lbs.  \nMy diet fluctuates but I try to eat as healthy as possible. I don\'t eat pork. Generally I eat steak,chicken,fish,salad,macaroni, potatoes etc.  \n\n\n\\-I will try to upload some pictures later after I leave work.  \nPlease any help would be greatly appreciated.'"
flagyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/tf3aws/sinus_infection_or_something_else/,b'Sinus infection? Or something else?',,"b'Long story: but heres some important back story. About 3 weeks ago, I was admitted to the ER for diverticulitis. Had horrible stomach pains and thought it was something bad that I ate. I ended up having diverticulitis (Im a 28f) and Drs proscribed me antibiotics cipro + flagyl. All of the sudden on day 3 of taking it, My throat swelled and I started sneezing and coughing uncontrollably. I couldnt breathe so I took a Benadryl. I called the Dr immediately and they told me I was having an allergic reaction to the antibiotics and stop taking it immediately. I went back to the Dr the next day and they gave me Augmentin. They additionally gave me prednisone to clear up the allergic reaction. The diverticulitis flare up went away and a few days later I started having normal seasonal allergy symptoms. Its allergy season where I live so I figured seasonal allergies were to blame. A week and a half went by.. and I started having 9/10 level pain in the right side of my face, nose, ears and teeth (upper and lower). I decided to call the Dr on Saturday and he proscribed a Z pack (Azithromycin) for what I believed had turned into a sinus infection. I should also add within that week I would take Motrin 1-2 times a day for sinus pain, Flonase everyday and used a netty pot twice a week. \nIts now Tuesday and day 3 of Azithromycin. The pain is not 9/10 but 7/10. Tylenol and IB profin have not worked for me no matter how much I take so I stopped am just suffering at this point. I went to the ER last night because I started vomiting and shaking and the RN straight up told me what did you think we could do for you? UH IDK.. youre drs and Im sick. She told me to let the antibiotics run its course and prescribed more prednisone and pain killers (norco). I woke up this morning at 2 am with the right side of my face completely numb. I panicked because I thought I maybe had a stroke or something. I havent called the Dr because I dont know what else they could do for me. The facial numbness is terrifying and painful. The Drs seem annoyed at me each time I call. Before my diverticulitis flare up, I never had been to an ER in my life. When I blow my nose, sometimes yellow/green globs of phlegm comes out.. and sometimes it clear. Idk what else to do. Ive cried so many times today and tried everything under the sun to get my face to come back to life (stood in the shower with burning hot water/ steam to unplug myself, hot compresses, hot tea, etc) but its swollen to another level and very tender to the touch. I just took Sudafed to see if it would decongest me a little. Its not working yet and its been about ~30 mins. I dont know what else to do at this point.. and the Drs are no help.'"

I (21M) have never had a hard time sleeping before. I've always been someone who not only could fall asleep eventually, but is a very deep sleeper. Some nights I've gotten 1 or 2 hours of sleep but most nights I've gotten no sleep at all. I've probably gotten 6 hours of sleep in total over the past 8 nights.\n\nI've visited and talked to two different doctors who say it is likely due to the Bactrim antibiotic course I was on since I don't have a history of insomnia and nothing in my life has drastically changed. However, my Bactrim prescription ended on Sunday and my sleep has not improved at all. \n\nAfter my first 3 days of insomnia, I decided to video call a doctor who prescribed me with 150 mg of Trazodone. The medication had no effect on me and the next day I found that I had extreme joint and muscle aches. I'm not sure if those were due to exhaustion from lack of sleep or if it was from the medication, but I decided not to take the Trazodone again since it didn't even put me to sleep to begin with. The joint aches have continued ever since, and are debilitating to the point where it's extremely painful just to lie in bed. \n\nAfter my 6th night of insomnia, I decided that I wanted to see a doctor in person, so I scheduled to see a doctor near my house. He prescribed to me 15 mg of Meloxicam for my pain and 10 mg of Ambien. I also got blood work done and am awaiting the results. The Meloxicam feels like it has no effect on my pain and the Ambien put me to sleep for 1 hour but after that I could not go back to sleep.\n\nWith each day that my insomnia and pain continue, I feel more and more despondent. It scares me that neither of the sleep medication that were prescribed to me could give me relief and I have an irrational fear that my sleeping will never be the same again. \n\nMy heart goes out to those of you who have suffered from chronic insomnia. I have only been unable to sleep for 8 nights and I've felt the worst I have in my entire life. I cannot imagine what it is like to suffer from this long term."""

Has this happened to other people?"" FYI, this story involves gross bodily functions.   \n\n\nMy husband and I have been trying to eat more vegetarian, more healthy, and more planet-friendly. We\'ve been eating Beyond Burgers for a couple years now, and we both like \'em.  This year, we started trying the Impossible Burger and burger meat to make things like meatballs. \n\nFirst Instance:\n\nFelt nauseous, had minor regurgitation, slept for three hours in the afternoon, b/c I felt terrible.\n\nSecond Instance:\n\nScarfed an impossible burger on a salad between meetings. One and a half hours later, had a bodily fire sale. Everything must go, out both ends. And it was awful. I told my husband several times throughout the two-hour ordeal that I was going to die. He was smart and kind and helpful. ""You\'ve just gotta get whatever it is out of you, you\'ll drink water, and sleep for a day. It\'s gonna be all right."" As he\'s washing my body and the shower. (I know. I got a good one.) (And I know, gross. Sorry. It\'s just what happened.)\n\nIn-Between\n\nI had chalked that last experience up to me not washing the lettuce well enough on the salad. I absolutely did not put the two instances together in my head. They were months apart.\n\nLast Night:\n\nHubby made pasta, impossible burger balls with cheese and sauce. Salad on the side. One and a half hours later, same as last time, but a little worse. After two and a half hours of vomiting and diarrhea, I had to finally lay down and literally will myself to stop. I was empty, there was no point in either. It took three hours of sleep and concentration to get it to stop. (I didn\'t want to go to ER for an IV, b/c expense and COVID.)\n\nOverall:\n\nI realized by my Googling that this particular subject of alternate meats is politicized. I think that\'s ridiculous. There\'s not enough beef to go around for all of us forever, and there\'s money for everyone. I am absolutely one hundred percent a beef lover. Steak is my favorite food. There is no agenda in this post, except to share with other people who are as scared as I was last night. I didn\'t even figure out the cause til about 5 AM this morning.  \n\nI also think it\'s worthy to note that both times, I had salad. It might have no bearing, but I dunno. Maybe the mix of both set something off? Possible red herring. Also, worthy of note, this just happened to me. I don\'t know anyone else yet personally to whom this happened. I have found other posts in Reddit and online about other people having an intolerance for the product. (though I haven\'t yet found one that matches my violent illness experience)\n\nAs an aside: I have asthma and allergies and have developed an anaphylactic response to NSAIDs as I\'ve gotten older. Yay aging.  Good luck. I hope this serves to help someone feel like they\'re not alone.'"

I wake up groggy and tired most morning but its so much better than not sleeping at all. \n\nWhat caused insomnia for me was mostly generalized anxiety disorder and, also ME/CFS.  Occasionally, I get insomnia and I take 25 mg of trazadone for it about 2 hours before sleep. Medication could be worth a try for you if youre still unsure.

influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/k0g762/my_allergy_immunotherapy_report/,b'My allergy immunotherapy report',Image1838.jpg,"b'I thought some people might be interested in my experience with allergy shots and drops.  \n\nIn Summer 2019 I got blood-testing for allergies through an ENT department.  They tested me for a total of 36 different things, of which I was positive for 23.  Five of them the doctor told me to treat as false negatives, in that I have experienced allergic reactions to them in the past, but the test came back negative: honeybees, rats, mice, coconuts, peanuts.  There were also many things they couldn\'t test me for, such as elephants, or some other trees.  \n\n[I was tested for 36 things, and was positive for 23 of them. ](https://preview.redd.it/7693ii26p9161.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9403866353190fe20ca7963073e2e7e7a3ccb292)\n\nI then started allergy shots in August 2019.  Their regimen was weekly shots for the first 48 weeks with slow tapering up in the concentration until I reach the maintenance dose, then once I\'m at the maintenance dose I\'d taper down the frequency of the shots.  ""The"" shot was actually three shots: one for dust/dander, one for pollen, and one for mold, with the mold one being in the opposite shoulder from the other two.  I often ended up with welts from my shoulder to elbow, so itchy that the only way I could resist scratching until I bled was to put an ice pack over my whole arm.  On at least three separate instances they slowed down my dosage tapering up schedule because of this.  \n\nThis continued for 7 months, and the continued need to keep slowing down my schedule was leading us to discuss allergy drops, when the first COVID wave in the USA hit my state in March.  They switched everyone at the clinic to allergy drops, which are taken daily at home, rather than weekly in the office.  I occasionally get some post-nasal drip, congestion, and/or sore throat, as side effects, but it\'s not a big deal.  My state was in a COVID lull this summer, so the clinic gave everyone the option to switch back to shots.  Due to the lack of clarity about COVID and asthma, and that we were discussing switching me from shots anyway, I stuck with the drops.  I\'ve now been on them for 8 months.  \n\nToday I talked with the PA, and asked about whether I should show results by now.  After some discussion of my symptoms in the last 15 months, we\'ve decided that I\'ve had ""ambiguously positive"" results so far -- for example, I haven\'t had horrible Fall allergies that put me literally in bed with a low grade fever for three weeks.  He said that unfortunately redoing a blood test wouldn\'t really show any differences, but I wasn\'t clear if that was because it hasn\'t been that long, or if it\'s because that\'s not how allergy immunotherapy works.  \n\nRegarding the how immunotherapy works in general, he said that there are two models for allergy immunotherapy.  The ""USA"" model is to give the patient treatment for **all** of their allergens.  For a patient with as many allergies as myself, this is only possible with shots, because the sheer volume of allergens would not fit in the drops.  The ""European"" model is to give the patient treatment for just **some** of their allergens, in the hopes that when your body is no longer sensitized to those, you will no longer react to *any* of them, or at least not as much as with the others.  This is what they\'ve been doing with my allergy drops. \n\nI was given the choices of continuing with the drops, or switching back to shots.  After discussion, I decided that I wanted to continue with the drops for now, and reassess when the winter COVID season has passed, and/or when I\'ve had the future COVID vaccination.  If/when we switch me back to the shots, we may have to start at the beginning again, especially since I haven\'t been treated with all of the allergens in the drops, and we\'ll keep an eye on the escalation schedule to see how I\'m reacting.  \n\nWell that\'s my allergy immunotherapy report!  :)  Feel free to ask any questions.'"
Advil,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/mtysor/i_think_im_trying_to_kill_myself_through/,"b""I think I'm trying to kill myself through self-sabotage.""",,"b'Let me start off by stating I (M26, AA) have been recently diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Diagnosis came in 2019 and was previously misdiagnosed as ADHD, as common with many Black children. I\'ve tried meds, most recently last week, though we only recently go the dosage right to give me the perfect balance of productivity and mood control. Then my psychiatrist retired and my therapist shortly after due to COVID. I essentially have to start from scratch and I just took my last pill last week.\n\nRegardless of these facts I\'ve been extremely high functioning my entire life. Juggling multiple extra-curricular activities in high school, etc. Even now, I work full time (Financial Consultant), an studying full time (MA in Econ/MSc in IT), and juggle two businesses I both found and run. Though sometimes I get run down and let these things all falter at once even knowing I have the capability to juggle them all. I think I try to induce stressors in these areas because I end up producing some of my best work in pressure-based environments.\n\nRecently, my (26F) long distance fianc has been drinking more, going out bar hopping ""alone"" on the weekends, not answering her phone and generally ghosting at night. When confronted about it she outright refuses to give me an explanation in defiance. Suggesting that I\'m being annoying or needy to even ask. We had been talking about me tailing a trip to Houston to love and work with her for a few weeks to a month just to rekindle things but she backs out and ghosts me again every-time it\'s the day of. This has been going on since mid-February. It is now Mid-April. I think she\'s cheating but I just make an effort to try and believe what she tells me and leave it to her conscious (if she has one) to sort the rest out. It got so bad that she blocked me completely from everything with no explanation for 24 hours and I felt so down about myself that I wrote a suicide note with my Will included for my family to find in case I needed it. Downed a bottle of Red wine and a few Advil PMs hoping I wouldn\'t wake up. I ended up calling the suicide hotline twice that night (they were no help btw). She answered finally after I bugged her to death the next day and I had hope that things were resolved (I was delusional). \n\nIn addition to my girl problems, I have been waiting 18 months for a promotion at my company that I was previously granted. Some loophole in our company policy blocked me from being about to take the position until March of 2021 (Hired Sept 2019, Promoted Dec 2019). Due to COVID we now work permanently from home. Just last week I interviewed for the position again as a formality as it was suggested that I pretty much already had the gig. This was the same day I was pleading for my fianc to unblock me and give me some explanation. She eventually did later that day as I mentioned but my head was all over the place  going into the interview. I got news on Friday that they went with another candidate and I\'m starting now to feel as if there is a larger motive by my bosses to keep my undervalued and underpaid. My current job requires no degree, no certs, and 1 years financial exp. I have 2 bachelor\'s degrees in related fields, my Series 7 and 63, and minimum 5 years experience.\n\nNeedless to say these things combined with running out of meds, among other things that are too long to explain, have caused me to break down and start making drastic decisions. I work first thing Monday morning but I packed two bags, all of my work equipment, and drove 12 hours to Houston to surprise my fianc, only to find that she isn\'t where she said she would be. I know form experience I won\'t get ahold of her in time to set up my equipment at her place, clock in, and complete my shift. I risked my job for this trip and it\'s the dumbest thing I\'ve done so far this decade. And I did it off of an impulsive decision and blind trust in my woman. Or was it self sabotage? \n\nI\'m now considering leaving my job cold turkey before they can follow me, breaking the engagement off with my fianc, spending the engagement ring money on a well-deserved two week vacation out of the country (first time, am vaccinated), and coming back to start my own practice, focus on my businesses, and finish my studies. It sounds wonderful in my head but I can\'t decide if these thoughts are a result of me just wanting more for myself out of life, or if it is self sabotage and I\'m purposefully derailing my life out of self-hate and depression as a result of my disorder. The worst part is that I\'m also afraid that I may be subconsciously pushing myself to my own suicide on foreign land. Or doing impulsive things and hoping as a result I die as a result of my own reckless behavior. This wouldn\'t be the first time and I desperately want to believe that I am making the right set of decisions. \n\nPlease advise. I think I\'m going to go off the deep end if I don\'t find some kind of solace.'"

A few weeks later I tried taking ibuprofen once a day since that actually helps the sciatic nerve. But on the second night I woke up with horrific heartburn. So I switched to voltarol gel. And not only did I get heartburn within two minutes of applying it (no joke!), but I swelled up again, my arms started hurting, and I got terrible brain fog as well as bizarre mood swings and crying spells that I associate with the withdrawal symptoms when coming off an antidepressant. Apparently even topical NSAIDs can cause stomach problems and water retention, and all NSAIDs carry the risk of causing depression, nervousness, and mood swings, particularly in people who have affective disorders (eg depression and bipolar).

I need help creating a homemade EO-rinse...I've been spending hours trying to figure this out""",,"b'Hi, /r/dentistry. I\'m a nutrition enthusiast and recently found out about the efficacy of EOs in preventing numerous diseases (caries, gingivitis) and for killing oral bacteria as well. They seem like a very effective alternative to CHX (no teeth staining), or as an adjunct to fluoride mouthwash (synergy w/ fluoride). \n\nIn hindsight, Listerine (an EO mix) is a ripoff compared to the other ingredients that I\'ve discovered. Also: I know nothing about dentistry and bacteria (which is pretty obvious but yeah), so please treat me like a layman.\n\nI\'ve also recently discovered what the terms ""MIC"" and ""MBC"" mean. This has been a huge help in determining which EOs are worth it and which are not. Correct me if I\'m wrong, but MIC is the amount of concentration of a compound in a solution that must be used to inhibit the growth of a certain bacterium, and MBC is the amount of concentration of a compound in a solution that must be used to kill a certain bacterium.\n\n So, I went onto PubMed and checked out over 20 reviews on essential oils and their bactericidal activities. But every single review seems to have different figures. \n\nFor example, one particular study might say that the MBC for Clove oil on E. coli is 0.5mcL/mL (I made that figure up, but you get the point), but another might say 1mcL/mL (much weaker). This variation is unnerving and I\'m unsure which EO to buy and how much to use because of this.\n\nI don\'t know much about oral pathogens, except that there are LOT of different strains. I also don\'t know why I should be killing them too, to be honest. I just know that there are bad bacteria and good bacteria (lol).\n\nI have already compiled a list of high-bactericidal EOs and their active compounds (according to the literature). Most of these I think have a very low MBC iirc (like, you only need .5mL for a 35mL mouthwash to kill most strains) in general, but the problem is, I think I have WAY too many on my list now.\n\nLavender oil was one of the weakest that I found with regard to bactericidal activity. It took around 17ml/35mL to kill E. coli, compared to less than 0.5mL/35mL for the stronger oils like Clove. This raises another question: is there any reason to use lavender oil apart from bactericidal purposes? Clearly it\'s quite weak and uneconomical for killing oral bacteria, right?\n\n**Most potent bactericidals:**\n\n* Thymol: Thyme oil\n\n* Menthol + linalool: peppermint oil\n\n* Eugenol: Clove oil\n\n* Carvacrol: Lippia sidoides\n\n* Eucalyptol: Eucalyptus oil\n\n* Lemongrass oil\n\n* Tea tree oil\n\n* Cinnamon oil\n\n**Less potent bactericidals:**\n\n* Aloysia gratissima\n\n* Manuka\n\n* Lavender oil\n\n* Coriander oil\n\n* American basil\n\n* Priprioca\n\n* Brazillian green propolis\n\n**Not sure about these ones:**\n\n* Macerated garlic oil (is it the same as clove oil for allicin content?)\n\n* Lime juice (was paired w/ macerated garlic oil to mask its flavour + smell)\n\n* Spearmint oil (vs peppermint?)\n\n* Myrrh oil\n\n* Sage oil\n\n* Lemon oil\n\n* Septilin powder (branded antiseptic powder)\n\n* Berberine powder (mentioned a couple of times for anti-inflammatory activity)\n\n* Meswak (dunno what this is tbh)\n\n**Possible anti-inflammatories:** (sorry, can\'t link sources, but some studies showed anti-inflam activity at certain concentrations)\n\n* Green tea powder (polyphenols were the active ingredient)\n\n* 0.2g/35mL boswellia powder (AKBA was the active ingredient, but AKBA is supposed to be expensive to standardise to)\n\n* 0.1% Turmeric (not sure if curcumin would be better)\n\n**Possible remineralisation agents:**\n\n* Also, another study showed that a fluoride toothpaste w/ 1.5% arginine + calcium carbonate (not sure what the ppm was) was more effective in remineralising teeth than fluoride toothpaste alone. MI paste has a very similar formula (cal + fluoride) iirc. The addition of arginine was the surprising part. Is this finding even clinically significant? [(Source)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660269)\n\n* Another study also showed that fluoride mouthwashes were more effective at remineralisation when paired with EOs or something... forgot the source.\n\n\nP.S. Sorry I can\'t bring up any proper numbers or citations... I really didn\'t know how to interpret the data so I didn\'t want to waste your time by bringing them up.\n\nAlso, here\'s an example of one of the EO studies measuring MIC/MBC [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4054083/). \n\n---\n\n**Some questions:**\n\n1) What do different oral bacteria strains do?\n\n2) When should you draw the line about how many EOs you should take (cost-benefit wise)?\n\n3) Are some of my ingredients redundant?\n\n4) Why is there so much inter-study (oh and intra-study in some cases -- something about an ""active fraction"" or whatnot) variation for MBC/MIC? How do I know how much to dose?\n\nThanks for your time.'"

I could not get into a dermatologist or family doctor today so I went to the ER hoping to get a diagnosis and perhaps a topical treatment. I was diagnosed with folliculitis and prescribed prednisone and 2 antibioticsSULFAMETHOXAZOLE and CEPHALEXIN.\n\nI tried several new products in the past week (I will never do that again):\nPerricone MD Foundation Serum w/SPF purchased at TJMaxx (only used once on half of my face to test color)\nHappy Dance Look Alive Face Moisturizer w/CBD purchased at TJMaxx (used once)\nCetaphil makeup removing wipes purchased from Target (used once)\nClinique All-in-one Cleansing Micellar Milk purchased from Clinique.com (used once)\nClinique 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly purchased from Clinique.com (used only twice)\n\nMy usual products include:\nClinique Foaming Face Wash\nClinique Liquid Facial Soap, oily combination to oily\nClinique Clarifying Lotion 2 (a toner)\nClinique Moisture Surge\nClinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel\nClinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Cream (occasionally)\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. does it matter what type of folliculitis I have and was I prescribed the right antibiotics?\n2. Which new skin care item was most likely the culprit?\n3. I have ragweed pollen allergies and the new foundation and new moisturizer w/CBD both contain daisy flower extract and bisabolol (a derivative of chamomile), could either of these cause an allergic reaction on my skin? Both ingredients are from plants in the same plant family as ragweed.\n4. Could my skin be allergic to CBD?\n\nI have included 3 pics from today, one from Sunday 3 days ago to compare.

dilaudid,https://www.reddit.com/r/ambien/comments/qrfw90/follow_up_from_last_post_ambien_not_working/,b'Follow up from last post: Ambien not working',,"b'I followed much of the advice and information given by you guys from my most recent (and only) post in this sub so far. Which was much appreciated by the way.\n\nSo today I met with my doctor to go over my medication plans yet again after doing some more research, and we both agreed that its most likely the high dose of Gabapentin thats been causing the Ambien to not affect me properly. \n\nThat, along with the fact Ive found I  am needing significantly more Klonopin than what was originally prescribed ever since  the assault occurred- as my panic attacks and new-founded agoraphobia has worsened more than you could fathom.\n\nMy doctor and I did come up with a plan to ween me off my current dose of gabapentin (currently 1800 mg per day; 600mg 3x daily.)\n\nIm happy to say that within even just the first week or two I have been able to get down to about 1 pill 3x a day as opposed to 2. As of today I am now beginning to forgo the evening dose of the gabapentin all together and avoiding eating after lunchtime, in order to allow the Ambien to affect me as affectively as possible under my current circumstances.\n\nGoing down on the Gab has been a huge thing for me, as in the past when Id been trying to lower my dosage- let alone try to get off of of it all together, had been the single worst withdrawals Ive ever experienced in my life. And I mean worse than coming off an opioid and benzo withdrawal simultaneously after having been on both of them for multiple years.\n\nBut this time around I havent found that Ive had very many problems with my reduction of my gabapentin dosage (as of yet, I pray.) which has been a lifesaver compared to everything else Im going through. Because if it had been anything like what it was like before when I tried to come off it, theres no way I could possibly do it.\n \nAlso yes I am aware that the amount of benzos I take a day (depending on the day- approx anywhere from 4-7mg of Klonopin per day) likely also strongly affects my GABA receptors ability to not properly absorb the Ambien at this time. However, I am just currently not in a safe mental/emotional state to lower my Benzo usage while still reeling from a horrifically brutal assault. \n\nIm just reiterating, Im what you would call  a seasoned veteran when it comes to benzodiazepines. Ive been on 4mg per day for many years so I have an extremely high tolerance. Though it is only been since the assault that it was increased to 5-7 mg per day as a PRN by my doctor.\n \nAlso- I have no doubt that the amount of benzos I take a day (depending on the day- approx anywhere from 4-7mg of Klonopin per day) likely also strongly affects my GABA receptors ability to not properly absorb the Ambien at this time. However, I am just currently not in a safe mental/emotional state to lower my usage if Benzos while still reeling from a horrifically brutal assault. (Just to reiterate, Im what you might call  a seasoned veteran when it comes to benzodiazepines. Ive been on 4mg per day for many years so I have an extremely high tolerance. Though it is only been since the assault that it was increased to 5-7 mg per day.)\n\nAt this appointment, due to the physical trauma of the assault my pain meds also had to be up as well. Which I am aware that opioids also affects your GABA receptors. Im on 15mg of Vicodin (5mg 3x let day, as well as 20mg of Oxycodone per day 5mg 4x per day. (Another sidenote, these are medications that I have been on for more years than any of the other ones. And then my taper it has come down significantly. As opposed to what Im on now, I used to be on 10 mg of Dilaudid per day which if you know much about opioids, is beyond a significant difference.)\n\nAll of this being said, my doctor and I, decided to put me on 10 mg of Ambien per evening. Since I still have not been feeling much of an affect yet, today I waited for 24 hours before eating & took my Klonopin, one pain med, and my Ambien at the same time. Since I have yet to feel anything from Ambien whatsoever I took two of my Ambien, a total of 20mg. \n \nTo be safe, I only took one of my Klonopin (2mg), and two of my Oxys (a total of 10mg) instead of the normal dose of each of those. And I forwent to Vicodin all together. \n\nAs a sidenote I would like to iterate that this is not what I intended to become a daily regimen, I do just wants want to experience the high at all. And after that I will continue to use just enough of each med and the right combination for it to be effective.\n\n\nI will keep you all posted on how tonight goes. Im hoping it goes well and that I get to hopefully trip, feel extremely relaxed, and get some very much needed physical pain relief. \n\nThank you all again for your prior advice on my previous post. \n\nAlso- if any of you happen to have any experience whatsoever with taking all these same/similar meds or similar med classes at the same time, I would also greatly appreciate your feedback as well. \n\nThank you guys.'"

I (23M, 200lbs, white, methylphenidate ER 36mg non-smoker non-drinker) have been taking buspirone 5mg that was not prescribed to me nightly for the past three or so months. It seems to be having a positive effect on anxiety symptoms that I've been experiencing and I seem to be tolerating it well from my (uneducated) perspective. I'd like to approach my PCP and tell him that I've been taking the medication without it being prescribed and express interest in being prescribed it as it seems to be working. I realize that there will likely be some proclivity on my PCP's part to prescribe a medication I've been taking without a prescription, so how would be the best way to broach this? Is it a crime to possess/use this medication without a prescription (it is not a controlled substance, FWIW)? Would most doctors be hesitant to prescribe this medication if a PT had been taking it without a prescription? Could I face any potential legal trouble by telling my doctor this? I'd hate to have to stop taking it because it seems to be working very well to manage my anxiety, but I don't want to continue to illicitly obtain it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?"""

I've had pain around the UR 2 tooth since May 2018 and I'm desperate for help! I do appreciate that these things can be difficult to diagnose. At present I'm in daily pain and have a gap in my front teeth, both of which are awful, so I would be really grateful for any help you can give me.\n\nThe background is as follows:\n\n\\- I'm aged 62 - no fluoride toothpaste when I was young, so a fair bit of restoration in my mouth, but I follow rigorous cleaning regime and regularly visit dentist / hygienist - last visit I was congratulated on absence of plaque\n\n\\- UR2 had some pain in 2017 and was diagnosed as having a calcifying root; pain went away, but came back worse this year, so endodontist did root canal on May 16th 2018\n\n\\- RCT did not stop pain, so eventually UR2 was extracted on July 31st 2018 with a view to having a Maryland bridge\n\n\\- Pain receded a bit and bridge was fitted on August 14th 2018, attached to UR3\n\n\\- Bridge seemed to be making the pain worse, particularly as the jointing material made the UR3 the only point of contact between the upper and lower teeth (dentist told me there was no alternative and that the bridge had to be like that)\n\n\\- Pain worsened, so after a month the bridge was removed on Sept 18th 2018\n\n\\- I'm still getting intermittent pain nearly everyday - I get about 1-2 days a week when the pain is hardly noticeable when taking painkillers, then 2 days with bad spells of pain: 9-10 /10 (dentist asked me to keep a pain diary) - and some days with just a mild to medium ache; when the pain is bad my right cheek swells and goes red\n\n\\- I've been taking 400mg ibuprofen + 1000mg paracetamol 3 times a day and my doctor prescribed amitriptyline to help me sleep - I'm desperate to stop taking the pain killers as I've now been on them since May\n\n\\- I would like to have an implant, particularly as going around with a gap in my front teeth is awful for me, but this can't be done until the pain has been sorted\n\n\\- I've seen 2 endodontists so far - initially I was told that the pain could be just reaction to all the dental work, but it is still going on; the one I saw last week said that there might be a small fragment of bone or root left in the UR2 socket / possibly some infection there and recommended apicoectomy of UR2 root area; however, today, when I tried chewing on the right side the pain came on very badly and appeared to be mainly further back than the UR2. I called the endodontist and spoke to their nurse, but no reply. Would a problem with the UR2 socket area cause a problem like this?\n\nI've attached the latest x-ray of the UR2, 3 + 4 area - I'll post the one of the UR3, 4 + 5 in another post in a moment. I have more x-rays going back to before the extraction, so if it would help to see those, or if you have any questions at all, please let me know.\n\nI would be extremely grateful if anyone could tell me if they can see anything in the x-rays at all (UR4 has an old root canal) or if they can help with any other suggestions.\n\nMany thanks!"""

Is there a way to only take one dose of Buspirone a day in the morning?\n\n2) For the past 20 years I've been used to the muscle tension in my jaw from the Adderall So much so that I have made a constant effort for such a long time to consciously not clench my jaws (specifically keeping my mouth relax in my tongue between the arches of my teeth) that it became second nature and I never experienced any sort of jaw pain or discomfort. For the past week or more I have had intense soreness in my jaw more so on my right side although, I still have not noticed any clenching. I have read the dopamine blockers such as buspirone could cause this and I know that adderal (being a methamphetamine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor) can cause this. However, as I said I have never had this problem with the adderal and I am wondering if it is a combination of the two drugs? Maybe it will go away the longer I take the buspirone?\n\nFor the final question, I have read some things about either beta blockers and/or diuretics helping with ADHD and/or anxiety? Does anyone have some insight on that?\n\nI do know that I retain water and eat a lot of salt. I am a salt addict I drink a ton of water but I don't urinate very often throughout the day.

But then I read the diuretics are used a moderately high blood pressure and I am stage 2 hypertension so I just figured that's why she went with the inhibitor.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, thank you all very much!"""

He has also had blood clots that continuously gone away and then reappeared in his lungs over the last year. Two weeks ago he could not breath and was in such immense pain that an ambulance was called. Due to Covid, I am not allowed to see him nor is his family. The hospital told him he had low oxygen, high blood pressure, high heart rate, lumps in his stomach and on his hip. They removed his gallbladder, pancreas, and all the lumps.

The blood clots went away with an iv drip of meds but his oxygen remained at 60%. The doctors could not determine a way to fix him. He was then transferred by ambulance to another hospital. At this hospital it was discovered his oxygen was so low that doctors were concerned his heart would stop. He now had four large blood clots in his lungs and the iv drip of meds was not breaking them down. Due to all his surgeries his medication options were limited.

I'm in my early 30's. I never thought i might have ADHD (even though ive always struggled with focus and just excused it as my personality, even though my highschool teachers wanted me tested because I would get high test scores but always be the last to finish, my mom refused at the time and i forgot about it) until i tried a friends vyvanse (just one 70mg). They suggested I try it when I described my focus, extreme daytime sleepiness (i used to be able to drink a monster energy or 2 and still be tired enough for a nap), and motivation problems. She said she had the same problems.   \n\n\nIt was the first time I was able to get through a whole day of work and not be sleepy or distracted or stuck staring at a wall which is super important because my job is essentially content creating and my money depends on my work ethic  however I didn't know how it worked and took it really late in the day, Like 5pm with an energy drink so I was up till the morning the next day, lasted at least 14 hours. She had also gave me one Adderall (20MG) to try which i took a week later to try (even though i think she takes them together) which my body did not take well to, had headaches, spacey, heart racing and the focus was not sufficient at all.  After that it took me a year to finally get the diagnosis from a neuropsychologist and coverage for vyvanse.  \n\n\nSo I started on 30MG, and the first days were awful. I didn't experience a crash like this before so it was unexpected. After only 3 hours I was feeling extreme depression, and 8 hours after my anxiety spiked (so bad my chest felt tight) and it just didn't last long enough (only 3 hours active time tops). It also didn't keep me awake, I took one 30MG one day and was able to sleep through the entire active time.  I need at least 8 hours of productivity and no daytime sleepiness. So I doubled the dose (2 30MG/60MG at once) and that lasted the 8 hours actively I needed almost exactly (not including the 2 hours for it to kick in)  and I had no depression side effects or very very mild by bedtime. I also had no anxiety spikes on this dose. , but I had trouble getting to sleep at night, even though I was taking it around 10:30am and stopped caffeine (protein coffee only, i no longer drink energy drinks) intake before 5pm. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(also keep in mind, i'm not taking it daily. I actually have about 8 30MG pills left. I hate the idea of being dependent on medication... I barely even take tylenol or advil unless the pain is unbearable and I have diagnosed anxiety after 2 panic attacks put me in the hospital but refused to refill my zoloft because I hated how I felt on it even though it worked. I've been able to mitigate my anxiety with breathing techniques and my dogs, i don't have anxiety everyday, only when dealing with a lot. So I really only want to take it for content days which require the most work and focus and days I want to be really active with my son like take him out somewhere and be attentive to him)\n\nCurrent problem:\n\nSo i asked my Dr to maybe give me slightly less than 60MG to try and he prescribed me 50MG. Well this is my first day taking it, took it at 10:30am with no coffee close to taking it and by 4:30 I noticed it basically worn off. So that's only an active time of 4 hours for me. I have only gotten half of what I needed to do today done. :(   I just drank a protein coffee at 4:30pm when I felt it starting to wear off so I'm not tired now, but most of the focus and motivation is gone. I don't understand how the 10mg could make that drastic of a difference. I also didn't feel the boost in energy as much as I did on the 60mg.  \n\n\nSo I'm wondering is it because I didn't drink my protein coffee closer to the dose like I did before (when i took the 60mg, i would drink my protein coffee exactly 2-3 hours after taking it) or can 10mg really make a huge difference? I have had break days between, sometimes multiple days in between so I don't think its dependence that fast. Or maybe because I didn't eat anything until the 4:30 protein coffee shake? Or maybe because I just didn't get much sleep last night?   \n\n\nI read on here that some people take boosters, but I'd really rather not take additional medications and don't know if I will be covered for double doses of smaller amounts (plus i'm really bad about taking meds on time). So other than boosters, is there anything natural you do to make it last longer? \n\nAny similar experiences?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n((sorry for the long post, this is my first one so I wanted to provide detail. I'll update here if anything changes))"""

Take occasional sumatriptan for migraine.\n\nI'm wondering whether I'm having an allergic reaction to metronidazole. My gut says I am, but Google says that it's very rare so I am not sure. My main symptom is itchy hives over my entire body.\n\nBackground: I went to the GP a while back about unusual discharge. She did a swab, which was negative for thrush, so she said we might as well treat for BV and gave me a week's worth of metronidazole. I took them without too much issue (bit nauseous, bad taste) and finished the course. But I noticed that the discharge remained so I got back in contact with the GP for advice about what to do next.\n\nI'm in the UK so the way of getting in contact with the GP is to fill in a long online form and wait several days for a response. Once you get the response you have no way of actually replying. Anyway, the response was to tell me to go to the GUM clinic.\n\nI didn't really want to go to the GUM clinic having had a very bad experience there before so (foolishly) I thought, I'll just buy a second course of metronidazole from a legit online pharmacy and see if that does the trick.\n\nI started taking the second course 4 weeks after starting the first course. \n\nOn day 3 (which was yesterday) and having now taken 5 of the 14 tablets, I very suddenly started with a rash. It began on my left breast, but within an hour it has spread across my entire trunk and back. The rash was slightly raised, pink hives of varying sizes and irregular shapes. Over the next few hours they spread to my arms and legs and expanded in size, despite taking antihistamines. \n\nI tried to get help from 111 and in the end I went up to A&E (which I now feel silly about) because my heart was racing and I was 'aware' of my throat. They sent me home with advice to take more antihistamines, which I did. I also discontinued the metronidazole.\n\nOvernight, the rash on my trunk has mostly calmed, but there has been some further spreading to my neck and face. It's very sore and itchy. My breathing has been fine throughout. I'm taking Piriton every 4 hours. \n\nI feel very stupid about buying more metronidazole and self medicating. I'm not even convinced that I have BV to be honest. It's just so hard to talk to the GP that I wanted to do something for myself. \n\nBut anyway, could this be a metronidazole allergy? I've tracked back through everything else I consumed in the 24hrs prior to the rash and there was nothing new or unusual. Also, the rash has reached everywhere, including the palms of my hands so I'm convinced it's coming from within. I am not otherwise  ill. \n\nAlso, in hindsight, I think the first course I took a month ago may have coincided with some (milder) itching that I had on my belly and left breast for about a week before, but that had cleared up before this happened. \n\nShould I consider that I have an allergy even though they are very rare?\n\nThank you\n\nI will try to put a picture in the comments."""

On March 27 I underwent a laminotomy (hemilaminectomy) with decompression of nerve roots, including partial facetectomy, forminotomy and/or excision of herniated intervertebral disc; 1 interspace, lumbar. When I go for my followup on April 14, Ill be able to ask him just exactly what that means hahaha. By the way, eight days out, Im really happy I did it.\n\n**INFO FOR WOMEN**\n\nThought to put this up here so it wouldnt get buried: I ended up getting my period two days before the surgery. The timing sucked, but having it fall when it did was definitely doable and nothing to stress over. Just let the nurses know you have your period; theyll give you cotton underwear and a pad to wear during the surgery. Just bring some overnight pads to put on your underwear once youre clear to change and go home, post-op. The nurses will help you put them in place if you ask (which you should). It isnt nearly as embarrassing a thing to ask as you think. Related note: The nurses told me not to wear tampons after surgery. Even if I wanted to, there was no way I was going to be able to finagle that thing up there (its hard to bend forward a little/you of course dont *want* to bend forward). Pads are the way to go, for sure.\n\n\n**DAYS BEFORE**\n\nCouldn't eat or drink anything -- even water -- after midnight the day before my surgery. Also, youre not supposed to take any meds 10 days before the surgery. It sucked, because thats seemingly when my entire body started aching hahaha (headache, PMS cramps, back/leg pain, etc.). Go grocery shopping with someone if you can. Theyre good to bounce ideas off of. I bought small bottles of milk, boxes of orange juice, pasta, crackers  basically things I could keep at countertop level/things that werent super heavy. I also made sure to place everything Id need in short reaching distance. And any clothes I might want to change into, I put on the end of my bed.\n\nI also bought one of those grabber things that are sold at medical supply stores (which has become my best friend since the surgery haha); a shoehorn if I need it; and my grandma sent me one of those things that help people who cant bed over get socks on. I tried that sucker out a few days before surgery and I recommend it. But back to the grabber  I assumed I wasnt going to want to reach forward very far after surgery (I was spot on with that one). This thing helped immensely.\n\nInitially, I was all set to recover in my third-floor walk-up apartment (I have a seriously wonderful  roommate, but shed be at work until at least 5 p.m. each day). Friends who work very close to where they live kept offering to allow me to stay in their place (which had an elevator) because they could check on me throughout the day/keep an eye on me at night, but I didnt want to put them out. Id be sleeping in their bed and relegating them to their couch, after all. But listen to me: If people are willing to have you crash at their place for a few days, do it. I will go into the reasons below. But please, please, please, if you can make arrangements to stay with people, suck up your pride and do it. I know its hard (it was for me to relent, at least). Recovery isnt impossible alone, but having people there to help you is incredibly amazing.\n\n**DAY OF**\n\nI was scheduled as my surgeons last patient of the day. I was supposed to go under around 2:30 p.m., but didnt end up under the knife until about 5 p.m. It literally is one of those go to bed but wake up immediately after like nothing happened situations. Before surgery, my surgeon told me his portion would take about an hour and a half. Anesthesia was scheduled to take about an hour pre-op. By the time I was done and in the recovery area, I believe it was around 7 or 7:30 p.m. \n\nI was in and out of it for a few hours after. The nurses told me Id need to pee before leaving. They also said if I couldnt pee myself, theyd have to catheterize me. Well if that didnt get me moving\n\nGetting out of bed was probably my biggest worry, pre-op. I knew how to log roll, but I was (and remain, even a little more than a week out) petrified Im going to twist and undo everything. The nurses kind of minimized the fear for me. Getting up is OK. The nurses will help you, and will also walk you to the bathroom. Youll (hopefully) notice your lack of sciatica in this moment. I did, and it was amazing. Also, it took me what felt like 10 minutes (but was probably like 3 minutes) to get all the pee out. \n\nI was given something with fentanyl twice immediately after surgery, then eventually given something with valium, then, upon release, was given small doses of oxy. Even then, I was in some fair amount of discomfort. I wouldnt say I was in pain, but it was a mix of like a locked-up feeling, pressure, and some soreness. Getting into my friends car was tough, but OK. Getting to their apartment was fine. You just need to move gingerly.\n\n\n**DAYS AFTER**\n\nI wasnt able to sleep for the first 36 hours, post-op. Not sure why. I wasnt in agony or anything like that. In fact, across my lower back was just a feeling of pressure/soreness/stiffness, but nothing extreme at all. I guess I was just wired? I also didn't have an appetite, though I tried to eat anyway. This is where I got into trouble, and why I was happy to be with folks. I received two prescriptions for pain meds: Tylenol with codeine and tramadol. The tylenol wasnt doing enough for me  it was helping, but I felt I needed more  so I waited six hours from my last dose of tylenol, and I took a tramadol after eating some meatballs. Long story short, I threw up. All over myself and my friends floor. I guess my body couldnt handle 50mg of tramadol. If I had been alone, I wouldnt have been able to clean up any of it. It was awful for me, and probably more traumatic for my hero friends.\nThe stiffness/soreness truly does let up day after day. The first day after surgery, Id get up every four hours or so and just slowly shuffle around for as long as I could take it  around 15 to 25 minutes  then Id go back to the bed. Each day, I was able to get up more and move around for longer, albeit carefully. I stayed with my friends for three nights and four days. On that fourth day, I walked around the halls of their building, and practiced going up a stair or two. That night, I was able to return to my third-floor walk-up. I took the stairs veryyyy carefully, but was able to climb them no problem. It took me about 10 or 15 minutes, but I got to my door without immense pain.\n\nSince then, its gotten better. Im getting random twinges of burning down my leg, but its not holding me back like it did all these months. My ankle still burns, and sometimes my hip/hamstring get that familiar, though far lesser, pain, but its not like before. I hope/assume thats normal. Im just in such a better state than I was before. I didnt get my full appetite back until about five days post-op. I didnt do a great job hydrating myself the first three days. I just didnt feel like drinking water. Do a better job than I did. \n\nI took one week completely off of work, and set it up so I could work from home the following week. Im fortunate to have bosses that allow that. They tell me I can take more time from home if I need it. I havent decided if Ill return to the office next week or not. \n\n\n**THINGS I LEARNED**\n\n- Its worth it. Hands down. Price be damned (waiting on the final bill, assuming its going to be hefty, even with insurance).\n\n- Breathe whenever youre getting up/down/walking around. Seriously, dont hold your breath. A nurse told me this when I was in the hospital. And he was right  any time I held my breath trying to get up from bed it hurt a lot more, because I was tensing up.\n\n- Bendy straws, or just straws in general, are specTACular. Invest in some.\n\n-Get ready to be a little grungey. I wasn't allowed to shower until five days after my surgery. I won't lie, I was a little greasy lookin'. But when you can finally wash yourself -- hot damn.\n\n- Post-op, if you have even an inkling you might need to pee, get up and start shufflin' towards that toilet because it might take you longer than you think to get to it. If you wait until you deffff know you need to pee, it's going to be tough. You can't speedwalk to the bathroom, and you need to take your time sitting down on the toilet, especially after surgery. Hahaha the number of times I felt like I was going to pee myself because I didn't get up in time. Fantastic.\n\n- Bring your phone with you everywhere around the house/apartment/wherever. Just in case you need something immediately, or you fall, or you can't get up from a seated position (this one happened to me when I was sitting at my friend's table). Hahaha felt a lil' pathetic, but you can't help it sometimes!!\n\n- Let the surgeon/nurses know if you cant swallow pills. I somehow forgot to mention it until like 15 minutes before being rolled to the O.R. The surgeon was able to get me the tylenol with codeine in liquid form, which I cant tell you how much I appreciated.\n\n- I really cant recommend the grabber enough. It has helped me get things out of the fridge, pick up my clothes, helped me get dressed. Seriously, consider getting one before you go under. Mine is about 30 inches long with little suction cups at the end.\n\n- **Just because you feel better, doesnt mean you are completely healed.** Im now eight days post-op, and the soreness and stiffness has subsided quite a bit. Its now to a point that I need to consciously remind myself to continue to log roll in and out of bed, and go slow when sitting down and standing up.\n\n- Get comfortable with the fact that you need to go slow and treat yourself delicately for the first few weeks. I have trouble asking people for help. I had to get over that with this whole thing. Its hard, but its in your best interest.\n\nIf anyone has any question, please feel free to reach out! These are all just from my experience  everyones experience will be different."""

Located in the USA.\n\n**Duration of complaint:** \\~10 months, give or take. Details below.\n\n**Existing medical issues:**  Crohn\'s Disease (Severe, onset 2015; in remission), low bone density,  cholinergic urticaria, vaginal atrophy, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (ablated/cured 09/2019).\n\n**Current medications:**\n\n* Stelara 90 mg/mL subcutaneous/8 weeks (for Crohn\'s)\n* Loratadine 40 mg/day and Hydroxyzine 25 mg/as needed (for cholinergic urticaria; anxiety)\n* Vagifem 20 mcg/twice weekly (for vaginal atrophy)\n* Minoxidil 0.625 mg tablet/day and Finasteride 0.5 mg/day (for hair loss)\n* Testosterone Cypionate 80 mg/week (for trans HRT)\n* Vitamin D 5000 IU/day (for low bone density. *discontinued 05/17/2023*)\n\nI do not smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol.\n\n**Main complaint:**\n\nI  started having some strange symptoms several months ago. The muscle aches and hair loss came first, both of which I wrote off. The sensitivity to cold and unusual menstrual bleeding were next, and these are what caught my attention. I thought they might\'ve been caused by the minoxidil (they started right after I began taking it; I didn\'t start  Finasteride for 3 more months), so I waited 4ish months to see if they\'d go away. The bleeding did, but the sensitivity to cold didn\'t. During that 4 month period, I developed more symptoms (listed/detailed below).\n\nSince  it wasn\'t going away, I decided to contact my GP about it. She said it was unlikely that oral minoxidil caused my symptoms, and that it was more likely my thyroid. I had subclinical hypothyroidism back in May  2020, so she figured it had developed into clinical hypothyroidism and ordered a TSH with free T4 reflex test for me. This made sense to me,  especially since my father, maternal grandmother, and maternal great aunt all have hypothyroidism.\n\nMy  TSH test came back 04/04/23 within the normal range (2.68 uIU/mL). My symptoms had not gone away, so I thought maybe the biotin in my  multivitamin had affected the test. My GP ordered another TSH test for  05/15/23, which I got along with lots of other bloodwork for my GI  doctor. This TSH test also came back normal, at 2.71 uIU/mL. Here are the [results of all 6 TSH tests I\'ve had to date](https://drive.proton.me/urls/108YE0EC9M#GyvMp1B8n8vc), for reference.\n\nThe other blood tests I had done were a CBC ([results, with reference ranges](https://drive.proton.me/urls/1S21SEEC78#563Rw88Bb9Ol)), basic metabolic panel ([results](https://drive.proton.me/urls/7CQTR3ZMMW#RPW1QVFYe44t)) ([results of the mentioned elevated A1C from 2020](https://drive.proton.me/urls/Y5H3DYHWVM#B1DHfQjpCHtI)),  vitamin D 25 hydroxy, vitamin B12, creatinine/E-GFR, c-reactive protein, hepatic function panel, ferritin, folate, iron total, and transferrin. My vitamin D level was very high (114 ng/mL; results) and my calcium was near the high end of normal, but all my other labs were normal. I have noticed that my (naturally high) RBC count, hemoglobin,  and hematocrit levels have been on a downward trend in the past few months, but am unsure if that matters/means anything ([result trends 2021-now](https://drive.proton.me/urls/QJFQC32CT0#cKRMYIrqM8Zl)).\n\nAfter seeing my vitamin D level, my GP said that was likely what was causing my symptoms and advised me to stop taking my vitamin D supplement. My GP  recommended retesting my vitamin D level in 6 weeks (around 06/28).\n\nI have since stopped taking my supplement and am happy to repeat the test in 6 weeks. Since I stopped taking it, I *have* noticed two other symptoms that I was having (increased thirst and frequent urination) have gone away. However, I don\'t think a high vitamin D level explains all of my other symptoms? It seems to me like many of my symptoms match hypothyroidism, but my recent TSH tests have been within the normal range (though higher than my pre-2020 results).\n\nSo,  I\'m hoping to get some opinions as to what might be up with me. Is it likely that high vitamin D really has been causing my symptoms? Is it possible something affected my TSH results? Or is something else entirely causing my symptoms?\n\nSorry if I\'ve given too much (or too little) info. I tried to be thorough without giving too much irrelevant info. I\'m happy to provide any extra info desired, as long as I have it.\n\nI\'m including a full list below of the current unexplained symptoms I\'m having:\n\n* ***Hair loss.*** Onset 9-10 months ago, got progressively worse. I originally wrote it off as normal male pattern baldness.\n* ***Unusual muscle aches***  (not noticeably due to exercise). Usually, but not always, in the legs.  Onset around 10 months ago. No noticeable increase or decrease in frequency since.\n* ***Increased sensitivity to cold/poor circulation in hands and feet.***  Onset around 6 months ago, shortly after starting low-dose oral  Minoxidil. I thought it might be caused by the minoxidil, but my GP said it was unlikely. Change was sudden (just happened one day) and significant.\n* ***Unusual menstrual bleeding.***  Onset at the same time as the sensitivity to cold. Bled for 2 weeks straight, then stopped. This was unusual because on Testosterone, I only ever have very occasional + light spotting.\n* ***Increased fatigue.*** I\'ve had chronic fatigue (cause unknown) for about 9-10 years now, but it\'s been worse in the past few months.\n* ***Dry skin.*** Onset 3ish months ago. Has worsened since onset.\n* ***Mild depression.*** Onset 3-4 months ago.\n* ***Unusual weight/fat gain.*** Onset 4-5 months ago.\n* ***Constipation.*** Onset 3-5 months ago.\n* ***Mild brain fog/memory issues.*** Onset 3-4 months ago.\n* ***Intermittent tingling/numbness in extremities.***  Onset 11-12 months ago.

I found out the time and the destination-- Las Vegas-- from the kind flight attendant who was helping me clean up the G&T I had fumbled while asleep. Still sort of tired I got my baggage and grabbed a taxi to the hotel/casino. It\'s name was plastered in the sky with giant neon red letters but they were too bright to read on my way in.\n\nOnce I reached my room I splashed water on my face to wake up and changed clothes.  The casino was dark, darker than any I had ever seen.  The games rolled on, people won and lost and yet the silence was deafening all around.  I sat down and had a few goes at two different roulette tables but every slot was a 00.  Snake eyes followed me in and out of every dice roll and the dealer\'s decks were far to rigged to spare me a coin.\n\nI jumped out of the casino and into my room for sleep.  Dreams of old memories and bad choices circled in my head for hours.  I woke with the awful sense that I needed to run.\n\nWithout checking out of the hotel I walked to the nearest car rental.  I figured if I could get to my family in LA they could get me home.  After driving three hours into the desert I stopped at a small bar on the side of the road.

I just want to share my personal experience with it so you can add it to your collection of others\' stories and come to your own decision if you\'re still deciding or having second thoughts during your course.**\n\n# PROS:\n\n\\+ Much less acne in general, and preventing acne is a lot easier. My face isn\'t anywhere near as magical and silky smooth as it was during the course, but it\'s definitely better than before the tane. Also I can actually *put stuff* on my skin/face now without worrying as much about breaking out, like sunscreen or makeup!\n\n\\+ It pretty much *solved* my dandruff problem, which I realized I had because it would all get stuck inside what used to be my thick forest of hair (more on this in the cons), and it was almost impossible to clear out.\n\n\\+ Smoother upper arms, which used to be rough/bumpy with ""chicken skin"" (keratosis pilaris).\n\n\\+ I really don\'t need to shower every day anymore (lol) since I don\'t produce nearly as much oil as I used to, and I don\'t have to constantly wipe my faceI used to blot my face with blotting sheets or napkins (either of which would come out *translucent*) every few minutes only to have the oil come back a minute later. Now I can be in humid weather and not completely break out in acne all over my *entire* body  *that\'s* how oily my skin was before the tane. In fact my skin doesn\'t feel gross in humidity, it feels like it *thrives* in humidity! Sadly I live in San Francisco, which is dry af.\n\n\\+ No serious non-cosmetic health side effects yet, e.g., Crohn\'s, depression, suicidal thoughts, etc. I don\'t notice a difference in my joints but I do think about or worry about that sometimes \n\n# CONS:\n\n**HAIR**\n\nMy beautiful, strong, thick, dense, wavy, healthy hair is not the same. During the course I though it was a *bonus* because my hair was slightly thinner and less oily which made it perfect and more manageable. However, about a month after the end of my course, my hair started falling out in clumps. Every time I\'d run my hand through my hair I\'d lose a huge clump. Honestly if I didn\'t start off with ultra thick hairso thick that I would complain about how thick it was all the timeI\'m sure I would have ended up bald. My hair used to be much thicker than average and now it\'s sparser than average to the point where I can see a lot more scalp than I\'ve ever been used to seeing. On top of that, each *individual* follicle is thinner, and I also have this weird mix of ultra thin hairs, normal-thickness hairs, and every thickness in-between, which I didn\'t even know was possible.\n\nI felt so blessed with my natural pre-tane hair that people would be in complete disbelief when I told them I never put any styling products in my hair because it always just looked like it had product in it from being so naturally strong, wavy, and thick. All I had to do was comb it in the style I wanted after a shower and it would just naturally lock in to a beautiful quiff, as long as I controlled how much/little shampoo/conditioner I used. [No](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXdl5Y8jJVQ/) [hair](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYKNr0ODQFX/) [styling](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbBJzPojRIi/) [product](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdrKShqjYiG/) [in these photos](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfcVThZBETH/), I\'m dead serious. Now my hair feels like it falls out easier, can only tolerate shampoo \\*at most\\* once a week, and needs special hair masks/leave-in conditioner and styling product otherwise it looks super dry. I can\'t even get it wet with just water without needing to put coconut oil in after.\n\nHonestly I thought I would get over this and accept my new hair after some time, which is why I haven\'t posted about it for so long, or maybe I thought it would recover and gain some of its original form back. But here I am 2 years later, still mourning this change and I\'m still not over it. I know I\'m still blessed to have a good amount of hair and I\'m lucky and grateful the tane didn\'t seem to cause anything like Crohn\'s but I\'m still filled with regret about what it did to my hair, which is/was one of my absolute favorite things about myself. For those of you who might be experiencing the tane hair loss and wondering if it\'ll stop or if it\'s permanent, *for me* it stopped shedding at an alarming rate after 1 full year of falling out fast. Now it\'s shedding at what I think/hope is a normal/natural amount. Most of what fell out in that year seems like it\'ll never come back, but at least what I have left seems to be shedding/growing at a normal amount.\n\ntl;dr on the hair: My hair used to be   a m a z i n g   and now just needs a lot more care and products.\n\n**SKIN**\n\nI scar way easier, even on my face, and my skin is just not able to heal as well compared to before the tane. A lot of blemishes stay for much, much longer, and some of them look permanent. I actually have to moisturize now whereas before I never moisturized because it wouldn\'t do it anything but feel gross and/or make me break out.\n\nMy skin is a lot drier, forms creases more easily, and just doesn\'t feel nearly as elastic/supple as it used to beI seriously feel like my skin has aged like 8 years instead of the 2 that actually passed. I also joined the eczema club, which I never had before. I get it in anywhere, e.g., fingers, thighs, and the inner corner of my right eye :( but thankfully it\'s not *too* common and tends to be mild.\n\nMy lips used to have superpowers or something because they legit would *never* get chapped, not even when I went snowboarding or to the desert lol but now they\'re normal lips that can get dry sometimes. Not a huge change issue tbh. I\'ve never ever had to use chapsticks and I still don\'t really need them. The silver lining here is that my tane course taught me the magical ways of 100% lanolin nipple cream as the holy grail chapstick.\n\n**EYES**\n\nMy night vision is *terrible* now. It\'s noticeably and considerably worse, particularly if I\'m trying to make out edges/shapes of things when it\'s darkmy mind will try to fill in what\'s there but is usually wrong which is can be really quite jarring. Also lights have a noticeable halo around them but that\'s not a huge problem, just slightly annoying.\n\n**STEATOCYSTOMA MULTIPLEX**\n\nI have steatocystomas, which are just little, painless, hard bumps/sac that stay just under my skin, permanentlylargest one I\'ve ever had was the size of a penny in my cheek. It\'s a relatively rare skin condition and largely inherited as far as I\'m aware, so if you don\'t have them, don\'t worry about this. If you do, keep reading.\n\nWithin these 3 years during/after my course I\'ve had at least 4 incidents of new steatocystomas, 2 of which ruptured out of my skinwhich had never happened beforeand 3 of which ended in permanent scarring, whereas they used to never rupture out nor scar. What\'s interesting/strange is that they slowly grow and get red, itchy, painful, and super hot. My body runs really cold so it was quite a stark contrast.\n\nAn incident I wanted to highlight involved 2 red, painful lumps growing on my sternum. Peak size was about the size of an eyeball. My derm suggested corticosteroid injections, which caused it to explode when she did it (gross, and painful wtf). It did help immediately calm the swelling, but after it healed it left a scar/indentation which is still there, 2 years later, about the size of a pencil eraser. A new one appeared about a year after that one, this time on my upper/inner left thigh. I decided to let this one run its course naturally and it\'s been healing for several months. I\'m pretty sure it\'ll just leave a permanent dark area but hey at least there\'s not an indentation scar like last time! No change in my existing steatocystomas prior to the tane course, and there doesn\'t seem to be a change in frequency of new steatocystomas compared to before.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nAll in all, I felt like this is what I traded for going on the tane:\n\n* Thick/hard-to-manage but strong, beautiful hair that I loved  thin/weak hair that needs a lot of gentle care and products\n* Super oily face  dry/normal face and super dry rest of the body, skin is way less supple, felt like it aged a ton, gets wrinkles easier, scars easily, doesn\'t heal as well, and it can actually thrive in humid weather now and not break out if I put any products on it\n* Rough, bumpy upper arms  smoother upper arms\n* Normal, benign steatocystomas  aberrant, scarring steatocystomas that often hurt/itch when they appear\n\nIf I could go back in time and tell myself if I should go on the tane, what would I say? Honestly, I would probably tell myself: **no**. Granted, there are a lot of pros listed above, and a lot of the cons listed are not a huge deal, but given that new steatocystoma growth naturally declines with age and so does skin oiliness, combined with the fact that new cystic acne frequency declined steadily as I agedat that point I had no more cystic face acne, only cystic bacne every once in a blue moon, plus I\'d learned to deal with them pretty well already, and I only had bad face acne before collegeI think I was too hasty in my decision to go on the tane. If I\'m being honest, my super oily face was too big of a factor in making that decision, and it shouldn\'t have been. I had cystic acne, yes, but honestly in hindsight it wasn\'t severe enough to warrant everything else, so in the end it personally wasn\'t worth it for me. Someone else viewing my situation/story might think it *was* worth it and that\'s a fair opinion too, but personally I regret it.\n\nI do know, however, that out of the 5 or so friends I know who have done the tane, they had an overall very positive experience, with few or no adverse permanent side effects. Only a *single one* of them regretted it like me. So, again, I\'m not trying to dissuade anyone, but just know that there\'s a riskjust as with everything else in life. It\'s a small one which is why I do generally still encourage people to try it even if I regret it.\n\nAll I ask is that you be very careful with your dosage because even though higher doses (shorter time) decrease chance of remission, it\'s remission of the good *and* bad; plus they can increase the risk of adverse side effects. Not all derms know thisthey don\'t even know about nipple cream as lip balm (come on!! Accutane 101!)and mine certainly didn\'t and put me on a dose that I personally think was inappropriately high toward the end of my course.\n\nFinally, I wanted to talk about something I see a lot in this subreddit: please don\'t negate or diminish our stories. We\'re not being shady or making this up or trying to dissuade people. I just want to add my story, even if it\'s not as positive as most stories here. Thank you for reading this wall of text.'"

A silver bullet?',,"b'Hello everybody I just want to say that I have been bipolar 2 free for two years right now. that doesnt mean o dont get depressed sometimes or feel amazingly inspired. Its just the painful exaggerated mood-swings are gone. I realize that medication affects everyone differently but here is what I did. I exercise to my full capacity every day, I go to cognitive therapy every other week, I take lamotrigone and kratom three times a day 2 grams, Rhodiola, Truebroc, astaxanthin and creatine. It took years of trial and error to get something that works for me. If i drink i take 2500MG of NAC before and after and my mood swings are lessoned greatly. I have to say when you first take kratom you get high but that wares off fast and might make you manic for a bit so start really low and try to avoid the high.  If you dont chase the high it it becomes a mood stabilizer and you just have a great day without noticing it. Wondering what other peoples techniques are? No silver bullet but this is damn close!\n\nP.S. to complicate things you also have the find the the right Kratom strains. To have consistency I buy in large amounts and Im also starting to grow because our friend Dr. Gotlieb (sounds like an evil scientist) is the head of the FDA and coincidentally hes a subcontractor for most of the pharmaceuticals. He wants to make it illegal.

NSAID,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/21yf05/lithium_and_injury/,b'Lithium and Injury',,"b""I injured my foot badly in December (12/8/13, at least two broken metatarsals showed after they had healed on the second set of x-rays, they apparently could not be seen on the first, upon physical examination it appears I have a lot of soft tissue damage as well).  I've been unable to get Obamacare because I qualify for my states Medicaid but I can't get it through my state because a loophole in their system essentially disqualifies me (my state didn't take the federal money and doesn't have to play by Fed rules as a result).\n\nI've been unable to get regular treatment or any treatment outside two visits to the ER.  I was supposed to see an orthopedist, podiatrist, neurologist and physical therapist.  I haven't had the imaging studies I need to find out the actual problem (MRI, Cat Scan) since the ER apparently only does X-rays now.  The ER has since (2nd visit March 12th) diagnosed me with Reflexive Sympathetic Dystrophy, an incredibly painful neurological disorder that often begins with injury, I don't know if they're right but it is incredibly painful.  \n\nIn exactly a week I'll have been on crutches for four months and while my condition has improved it plateaued around month three and no longer appears to be getting better.  Throughout this I have yet to receive any adequate pain relief, I spent the first month in bed crying nearly non-stop from pain, it has improved but not enough.  \n\nI was given nebumatone an NSAID at the hospital which I didn't take because I'm on lithium (which they were well aware of and I voiced my concerns repeatedly).  Though I knew it had the potential to give me lithium toxicity after a few days it hurt so bad I didn't care and I filled the prescription and got a mild case of lithium toxicity.\n\nThe hospital refuses to give me anything but an nsaid for pain relief in spite of the contraindications.  I've stopped taking my lithium so I can get a little relief by taking this stupid drug that doesn't even do a good job relieving my pain, but it's better than Tylenol or nothing and I'm desperate my foot hurts so badly.\n\nI'm afraid to tell anyone I've gone off my lithium because I know how pissed my boyfriend, friends and family will be.  I know I haven't been myself, I walked away from my freelance job even though I desperately need the money.  I'm destabilizing rapidly, but I don't know what else to do. \n\nI've been in pain so long all my physical/emotional reserves for dealing with it are used up.  I can't sleep for more than a couple hours at a time, I can't walk.  If it is Reflexive Sympathetic Dystrophy my odds of walking normally ever again get worse the longer I am without aggressive treatment, especially physical therapy.\n\nIf I take these pills I can limp without my crutches I can do some of what I would do in physical therapy (broke the same foot in same places a little over a decade ago and remember how was rehabilitated last time).  \n\nI don't know what to do.  I'm not asking for advice I just need someone to listen because I can't tell anyone else.  I know it's a bad decision to go off my lithium but I don't see as I have any choice.  I need to be trying to rehab my foot and I can't do it if I don't have something to relieve pain and swelling.   Lithium has been one of my miracle drugs and I'm not doing well without it, there are no viable alternatives, I can't even afford to see my psychiatrist since I walked away from my freelance job.  \n\nI feel hopeless and helpless and the pain has made me suicidal for months now, they could have given me an opiate that wouldn't interfere with my meds but apparently no one does that anymore either; because drug seeking.  I don't understand why some people looking for drugs mean I can't get any relief.  I'm sorry so long but I just have no one else I can say any of this to and I needed to get it off my chest."""
lipitor,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/solfhy/drugsmedication/,b'Drugs/Medication',,"b'It has long been my opinion that mental health prescriptions need an overhaul in how professionals approach them. From what I\'ve been able to tell, psychiatrists simply ask about family back ground and symptoms and prescribe the drugs they like. The problem I have with this MO is that there\'s no indications as to why this drug is right for you. It\'s basically an a combination of guesses to determine what\'s right for you. In my life, i\'ve been diagnosed as bipolar, major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and BPD and I\'ve received medications for many of them. But at some point it had occurred to me that some many clinical issues rely on detailed metrics, studies, blood tests, etc. such that I get the feeling that mental health is just not taken as seriously. For example, you\'re not going to receive a prescription for blood pressure control unless they can identify a pattern of high or low blood pressure. You\'re not going to get a heart medication without detailed imaging of your heart and a battery of tests. You\'re not going to be prescribed methadone unless you\'ve had a history of heroin/opiate abuse. You\'re not going to be prescribed lipitor unless they\'ve noticed high cholesterol. But when it comes to mental health, asking a few questions in a 1-2 hour session is all they need to pick a drug.\n\nI\'ve noted this post as a question for a reason. I wanted to know if any health care people out there have any insight into why this is. Apparently medicine is good enough to determine brain chemistry and brain imaging can tell you a lot about a person but is there any particular reason that these doctors are not held to the same high standard as every other medical health professional? It just seems like throwing stuff at a wall until something sticks (if you\'re lucky enough to get that far). I understand medicine has a lot of outside influence such as financial, political, insurance, etc. But doesnt it seem kind of ridiculous to do things this way? I mean, if we lacked the ability to do these things, I\'d get it, but we DO have the ability to do brain scans and take something away from that. I don\'t have the background to say how relevant such information could be but anything that makes me feel better than ""well let\'s try this because this is the drug I like or this is what worked for aunt sue"" would make me feel better about a drug I would take.\n\nI guess I pose this conjecture for the reason that, I\'ve always wondered why the double standard in medicine when it\'s sooo important. And 2 I don\'t have any faith in medicine to actually help me. I\'m in a bit of a rough spot right now and I don\'t trust a psychiatrist to do anything right by me. If I went to see a psych professional it would be ""here try this other SSRI"". Okay well, I\'ve tried a few of them and none of the others worked so why do you think this one will? And they\'d just be like, meh because we can\'t do anything else. If I asked ""what makes you think this drug is right for me"" I don\'t think that I could believe anything they say. A conversation can only go so far in these evaluations and that all the eggs are in the conversation basket seems irresponsible of the mental health profession/industry. I would definitely feel better seeking medication if they could look at something, evaluate something ABOUT ME and not relatives.\n\nThanks for reading'"

My insurance covers nothing until I meet my deductible... I have generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and depression.  Probably undiagnosed ADHD.\n\nMy history: \n\nI was on sertraline for years in my early 20s.  It would make me nauseous but help the  depression ease up a little. Wasn\'t super great but it worked ok.  I was also on atenolol for social anxiety. I liked my doctor and she understood my issues with needles/doctors and never pressured me.\n\nI moved states and had to find a new doctor, but the one i ended up going to made my have a panic attack.  I wasn\'t able to get myself to go to a doctor for a few years so I ran out of meds and ended up off of them. \n\nI have been slowly getting worse and worse. I\'m flip flopping between unbearably anxious always and extremely depressed with tiny spurts of feeling really good and doing allllll the things. Mind racing all over the place, anxious, worrying about everything, beating myself up for not doing more or getting better to being just numb, doing nothing. Most of the time I feel ""stuck"" just unable to get anything done, dont enjoy anything, cant take care of my house, sometimes its a battle just to get myself to eat food. I go through periods of using exercise as a coping mechanism/distraction to just not working out at all. When I manage to find a hyperfixation for a few days, its so wonderful to be able to do something (even if its not any of the stuff I need to do).\n\nThis summer(July), after months of agony over finding a pcp, I tried to get back on the sertraline and atenolol and not only did it not help, but I was so incredibly nauseous I would throw up multiple times every day. I couldn\'t do it. I even started on a half dose. She doesnt do ADHD diagnoses. She tried to refer me to her ""usual"" psychiatrist but they weren\'t accepting new patients so I was on my own finding one. \n\nRecently (September), I started seeing a PMHNP. She said that I probably have undiagnosed ADHD and probably some OCD in addition to my anxiety/depression. The ADHD was not surprising, I\'ve been wondering that for a while. But the OCD was a surprise. She referred me to psychiatric testing for an official diagnosis but it looked like it would cost $2-3k, which I don\'t have. So she started me on wellbutrin xl. It seemed to work at first with a side effect of me being very spacey and forgetful.  Now it doesn\'t help with my anxiety and depression at all, and the spaceyness and forgetfulness is still present. Its ruining my job performance and I still don\'t feel better. She mentioned vyvanse would probbaly be her move, but Id need an official ADHD diagnosis.\n\nI\'m trying so hard to find the right person and treatment but theres so many options out there and its just so so expensive and taxing on me. I just don\'t know what to do. But I am very aware that Im just getting worse. I dont leave my house. I don\'t see people. I wear headphones at the grocery store to avoid others. I lay in bed for hours doing nothing. I will spend all weekend beating myself up for not being able to do anything- cleaning dishes, any sort of fun hobby, watching a show. I do dance and learn dance choreographies from home because it helps my brain shut off, so I think I get plenty of exercise. But even then I struggle to get myself to start/ enjoy it very often.\n\nAm I on the right path?  Do I go back to the PMHNP? How could I get an official diagnosis without the price tag of $2-3k? \n\nI\'m so overwhelmed with making decisions, any guidance would be appreciated.\n\nThank you'"
codeine,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/qysbum/sobriety_and_revelations/,b'Sobriety and Revelations',,"b'Hi friends- I needed somewhere safe and anon to unload. Its been a rough few days. Trigger Warning: Child abuse, Drug use\n\nTL;DR- Toxic childhood, abandonment, sobriety and questioning mothers role in my trauma. Am I being unreasonable for cutting her off?\n\nBit of back story- \n\nI was an only child (just my mum and I) until I was 8. I had a reasonably normal childhood up to that point. Id spend a fair bit of time with my grandparents (mothers side) due to mum needing to work full time.\nAt this job she worked at, she met the man who would eventually be my step-father. \nAs a child, my biological father was not very involved, but I still had a bit of contact with him and his side of the family. \n\nFast forward- Mother and Step-father obviously get married. \nHe was an angry man, but then extremely kind at other times. I thought this was normal. \nThey end up having 2 kids, my brother and sister, 10 and 12 years younger.\n\nIt didnt take long for the the grooming and inappropriate behaviours to begin. \nAsking me to shower with him after school before mum got home, showing me how to wash myself, making inappropriate comments about my body and appearance etc. Mum was none the wiser. This lasted until I was 14 (I guess I outgrew his interests)\nThere was also physical and emotional abuse, for 10 years. I witnessed knives held to throats, threats of suicide and threats of murder. He never hit my mother but did throw things, yell abuse at her and restrain her (her words). \nMy parents also had 42 foster children in our care over 5 years, who were all high needs, who also made allegations of varying abuse from step father. Because of the children having high needs, I was often left to my own devices and forgotten about. Apparently this made me hard to love or be proud of, because I wasnt making good choices (she told me this today). \nShe never told me she loved me or was proud of my until I was 23 when I called her out in it- and said her love language is giving not saying. She began saying it more after that. \n\nI moved out at 18, and I finally hit breaking point one night. \nMum and I had been at a local club having some drinks after work, and she had separated from him a few weeks prior due to obvious ongoing abuse. I was proud of her.  \nWe had a arrived at my mothers home so I could pick up my vehicle to travel home (about another 25 mins away). As I walked through the house, I saw he was in her bed. \nI snapped. Walked out of the house and burst into tears and called my grandmother, and disclosed everything. My world turned upside down that night. \n\nWe moved away. Mum, siblings, me and ex partner moved 800kms away to my grandparents home to start fresh and heal. I underwent mental health assessment and began therapy. \nOnly 4 months after moving, mum said she saw on my Facebook that I had apparently left open- I was lying. This is not true. \nShe moved back to him that day whilst I was away with a friend. \n\nAt this point- I broke. I ended up in the local psychiatric ward, after stating to my grandparents I had every intention of KMS. i was only there 5 days over easter, but on my first night, my mother rang to abuse me on the ward phone for being a drama queen. \n\nI was 19. I stayed with my grandparents for the remainder of that year, but due to the small town mentality and no work, I moved back to my home town. I hadnt spoken to my mother until my return, and she was still with him. I suppressed much of those feelings and wanted to move on and reintegrated into the family, still living externally but keeping a close eye to watch my siblings who were still at risk. \nI learnt about narcissism, which is exactly what my stepfather is. \nMy diagnosis is C-PTSD and ADHD. \n\nSo- I fell heavily into drugs. \nWhen I was 15, I first was introduced to Codeine, due to working in a manual labour job and requiring pain relief to even walk after work. I took them accidentally think they were just plain paracetamol. Those pills were not prescribed to my mother or stepfather but given from a family member after major surgery. \nThey made me feel so good and relaxed. \nIt was my 13th year of opioid use in 2021. I went from codeine to morphine and oxy progressively. I had a car accident which resulted in some slipped discs and arthritic bone spurs, so I had access to opioids always. Benzos for the muscular pain. \nI also got into to party drugs and later, into the much heavier drugs. I was an ice/speed addict for 4 years, up until my own son was born. It was my only coping mechanism. \n\nI have undergone intense therapy, particularly in the last 4 years, and had progressively started not taking as many painkillers or benzos, with no particular reason why. This started about 6 months ago and I can only assume its because Im in a really good mental place, I am preparing for a surgery that will positively impact my life and also being a parent has made me very aware of my mortality. \n\nIn the last 2 weeks, I have been stone cold sober. I have quit vaping (3 years no tobacco, vaping 9mg of nicotine), all painkillers except paracetamol and nurofen as required and quit marijuana. \nThe withdrawals were painful emotionally and made me physically ill, and I wouldnt take it back. Worth every second. \nI have mourned (and often still do) the life I lead, and celebrating whats ahead. \n\nMy biggest challenge has been seeing things from a different perspective, and realising that my mother never protected me. \nWhen I was getting abused, she wasnt, so allowed it. \nShe abandoned me when I needed her. She didnt fully believe me until my sister disclosed 18 months ago and I am struggling to come to terms with that even though I thought it was resolved. She left my stepfather 3 years ago and has been no contact for 2 (siblings were still under 18 at that time). \nBrother disclosed physical assault for years and sister sexually assaulted also. This monster is pure garbage. \n\nAm I being unreasonable in how I am feeling?

anticonvulsant,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/v4o1m0/memory_loss_and_mental_health_medications/,b'Memory Loss and Mental Health Medications',,"b""Memory loss is a common topic within the mental health world. I'm an RN that works in Mental Health & going to do my best to summarize some research on *which* mental health medications impact our memory and *why* they do.\n\n**Memory** refers to the mechanisms that are used to collect, accumulate, preserve, and later retrieve information. There are three actions involved in **'memory'**: processing, storing, and recalling.\n\n## I will Include the link to the original post that is probably easier to follow but also going to include all the info below.\n\n[https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/](https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs\n\n**citalopram, celexa, escitalopram, lexapro, fluoxetine, prozac, sarafem, symbyax, fluvoxamine, luvox, luvox CR, paroxetine, paxil, paxil CR, pexeva, sertraline, zoloft, vilazodone, viibryd**\n\n### Drug class\n\nThis is a very common drug class; prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, migraines, panic attacks, eating disorders, PTSD, OCD, and even chronic pain. Over 10% of the US takes an SSRI.\n\n### What Do SSRIs Do?\n\nWhat does every medication within this class have in common? They all increase the level of Serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. When you take a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, youre blocking the neurons from reabsorbing Serotonin, meaning there is more Serotonin available.\n\nSo what does Serotonin do? Well, A LOT. Serotonin influences our mood and emotional state, our digestion, appetite, our sleep cycle. It is found in your brain, in your intestines and even in your blood. One could argue that it impacts everything.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nSerotonin is even in animals, plants and fungus. While we can measure the levels in our blood we cannot measure the levels within our brain. Meaning were all in the dark as to how much is within our brain and whether or not its even correlated to the amount in our blood.\n\nHow SSRIs Impact Memory\n\nAge and gender do not seem to influence the data that SSRIs are correlated with memory effects. Something that is important to mention, is that while research has shown that SSRIs are *correlated* with memory loss, that doesnt exactly mean that they CAUSE it. Correlation and cause are two different things. Many people that take SSRIs also take benzodiazepines, drink, smoke, have genetic predisposition to memory loss, etc. Depression and anxiety themselves can even cause memory problems.\n\nSummary\n\nSo, after reading through many articles, there overall wasnt enough credible information to emphatically say that an SSRI causes memory loss. In fact, I came across more research that suggested SSRIs improve cognitive performance and memory. Some data also specifically supported that SSRIs can improve memory for patients experiencing psychosis and depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Tricyclic Antidepressant | TCAs\n\n**anafranil, clomipramine, asendin, amoxapine, elavil, amitriptyline, norpramin, desipramine, pamelor, nortriptyline, sinequan, doxepin, surmontil, trimipramine, tofranil, imipramine, vivactil, protiptyline**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThe word tricyclic refers to the three molecular ring shapes associated with this drug class. These existed before SSRIs, but they seem to cause more side effects. This has led to SSRIs being more commonly prescribed nowadays. TCAs are still often administered for things like anxiety, depression, migraines, panic disorder, eating disorders, mood disorders, insomnia, hormone disorders, bedwetting, and even nerve pain.\n\nWhat do Tricyclic Antidepressants Do?\n\nWhat do all TCAs have in common? Similar to an SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants impact neurotransmitters. But, in addition to serotonin, they also block the reabsorption of norepinephrine. They ALSO block acetylcholine receptors. These key differences create a cascade of effects in the body that do impact memory. These key differences are also the culprit for the common side effects in this drug class like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nIn 1945, the Sulphur bridge of the phenothiazine ring of promethazine was altered to synthesize G22355 ( a weak antihistamine and mild anticholinergic with sedative properties). The new 'invention' was tested as an antipsychotic. It was ineffective for schizophrenia, but did have antidepressant properties. Thus, the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) was discovered.\n\nHow TCAs Impact Memory\n\nThere are multiple reasons why a TCA impacts our memory. **The first reason** is that we retain memory best when norepinephrine is released at an optimal rate. These drugs block the reabsorption of norepinephrine; which is known to be a moderator of memory. With too much of it, we are anxious and stressed, too little of it and we are drowsy and not as coherent. Either way, the drug has an impact on norepinephrine which directly influences how we store memory.\n\n**The second reason** why this drug class impacts memory is because it competes with our natural antagonists on muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors. It is well documented that these drugs block muscarinic receptors (which is an acetylcholine receptor), and acetylcholine directly impacts learning and memory.\n\n>*Muscarinic*acetylcholine*receptors* in the hippocampus and cortex underlie*memory*formation\n\nSummary\n\nSo, TCAs are a drug that research has linked with memory impairments and dementia. These drugs interfere with our bodies baseline of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. As with any drug; sometimes they create an optimal effect on a person, as for others, not so much. If a person is too excitable and anxious, a TCA can improve their quality of life (even could improve memory if their extreme anxiety was impairing it), while for another it can make them drowsy and leave a bad impression.\n\n\\*Note each drug within the class impacts the degree of these effects a little differently.\n\nIf youre feeling like doing a deep dive into some of the articles I read to gain clarity, by all means, click the links below!\n\n[Differential Cognitive Actions of Norepinephrine 2 and 1 Receptor Signaling in the Prefrontal Cortex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4876052/)\n\n[The effect of tricyclic antidepressants on cholinergic responses of single cortical neurones.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1666268/?page=7)\n\n[A brief history of antidepressant drug development: from tricyclics to beyond ketamine](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/acta-neuropsychiatrica/article/brief-history-of-antidepressant-drug-development-from-tricyclics-to-beyond-ketamine/B5C9D55C6299BC41B237187DB609DB68)\n\n## \n\n## Benzodiazepines\n\n**alprazolam, xanax, chlordiazepoxide, librium, clonazepam, klonopin, clorazepate, tranxene, diazepam, valium, lorazepam, ativan, oxazepam, serax, temazepam, restoril, triazolam, halcion**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThese are commonly considered anti-anxiety medication (though can be used for seizures, insomnia, and muscle spasms). They work by quickly slowing down important parts of our brain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets taco bout it.\n\nThis drug class specifically targets the GABA-A receptor, enhancing its effect, which slows down our central nervous system; this makes us feel relaxed, because the drug has retarted a major gear in our system (sometimes this is EXACTLY what we need).\n\nDid You Know?\n\nAnesthesiologists often give Versed (a benzodiazepine) so patients will not remember surgery?\n\nHow Benzodiazepines Impact Memory\n\nThis drug class changes our mental state & while the drug is advantageously quick acting, the effects linger. Short-term memory is not as affected, but long-term memory is specifically impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory and thus not consolidated into memory storage. The effects are similar to the long-term effects of alcoholism (alcohol is also a CNS depressant). Both of these substances, used long term actually damage our brain.\n\nThis is why a rehab center isnt going to allow the use of 'said drug' while recovering. This is why therapists often (but not always) stray away from patients taking 'said drug' while trying to work on trauma, recovery, etc. If the brain is not functioning & you're not able to remember anything, how can you work on it? The most effective aspects of benzodiazepines are precisely why individuals have a tendency to become dependent on them.\n\nNow, don't shoot the messenger. Obviously, there is a time and a place for benzodiazepines. They're an actual life saver for the (hopefully) occasional panic attack. But how sadistic is that Benzodiazepines have addictive properties, which means that with *repeated* use we will need *increasingly* higher doses, making the dent in your memory more and more indisputable.\n\nFull Disclosure\n\nMy mother was an addict, benzodiazepines being her drug of choice.\n\nDo you know an addict whose drug of choice is a benzodiazepine? No SHAME, but if so, you can probably attest that **they dont remember shit.**\n\nHow about an addict whose drug of choice is alcohol? All love here, but you can say for certain, *they dont remember shit*.\n\nThere has even been a fair amount of data to support that the risk of Alzheimers is elevated in those taking the drug for over 6 months. One Harvard study even speculated that it would raise the risk by 84%! Seems unrealistic, but who am I to question Harvard; I'll add the link below if you're also feeling speculative.\n\nAnother point of concern is that this drug will inhibit your brain from initiating activity of GABA A (since the medication has so kindly been doing it). What this means is that after the drug is long gone from your system, your brain experiences a lag in restoring the normal GABA balance.\n\nThis is often what is referred to as *rebound anxiety* because your anxiety is likely to get worse, before it gets better after taking a benzodiazepine, especially if taken long term.\n\nTake it from a nurse who works in mental health; it's not enjoyable being the bystander of a patient trying to escape their benzo addiction.\n\nBut this is why the mental health world is increasingly trying to move towards low dosing and only prescribing for a limited amount of time.\n\nNow, Benzodiazepines are very dangerous to quit cold turkey, so please dont go flush yours down the toilet after reading this.\n\nWhen Benzodiazepines were first discovered they offered an immediate solution to the overwhelming crippling anxiety that many people face, but the harsh reality is that were now in a benzo addiction crisis. Were learning over time, as a society and those changes dont happen overnight. And trust me, as a mental health professional I myself occasionally grow infuriated at the amount of family doctors who prescribe copious amounts of benzodiazepines only to later turn the patient away after addiction has crippled them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Harvard Article Claims Benzodiazepine use may raise risk of Alzheimers disease](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/benzodiazepine-use-may-raise-risk-alzheimers-disease-201409107397#:~:text=People%20who%20had%20taken%20a%20benzodiazepine%20for%20three,84%25.%20The%20type%20of%20drug%20taken%20also%20mattered.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Right now Im having amnesia and dj vu at the same time.

This drug class actually encompasses three different major classes\n\n1. Blocking Sodium Channels\n2. Enhancement of GABA Inhibition\n3. Regulation of Synaptic Releases\n\nWhy it Impacts Memory\n\nOverall, anticonvulsants work in different ways; trust me I rode the magic school for HOURS trying to gain an understanding of them to write this. Truthfully, we still have a lot to learn about them. Their impact is complicated and the effects range based on the dose and drug.\n\nFor instance, Topamax has pretty diverse pharmacologic actions, because of that, it **has** been linked with impaired concentration, cognitive dulling, psychomotor retardation, language and comprehension difficulties, rather extreme effects on short-term memory and working memory, poor verbal fluency and word-finding, reduced IQ scores, abnormal thinking and delayed cognitive speed. Because of this dark cloud of side effects, Topamax is sometimes referred to as 'Dope-A-Max'.\n\nHowever, a more selective medication within the drug class such as Phenytoin or Tegretol are more specific to blocking sodium channels. Overall, they seem to have less impact on memory and cognitive function.\n\nMany of these drugs listed above have an impact on GABA, and long term exposure to GABA agents can alter the functionality of GABA permanently, which means there are potentially permanent consequences to cognition, behaviors, and memory.\n\nPhenobarbital has been linked to lower IQ, and worse effects than Depakote and Tegretol, however it is actually a barbituate. Its effects are similar to benzodiazepines which you can read more about above.\n\nGabapentin, used for seizures and often mood disorders, belongs to it's own drug class. Still, it **has** been linked to memory impairment. Hence, the name, it also impacts GABA, which as mentioned several times now, certainly plays a hand in our ability to remember. At this point there isnt enough research to say its linked to dementia though.\n\nAs far as drugs for epilepsy, Gabapentin is tolerated much better than many others. Its also worth mentioning that this drug seems to have more *short term* effects on memory. Some will experience a disorienting feeling or short term memory loss while taking Gabapentin, but the reports of long term memory being impacted are reported less often.\n\n[Long Term Effects of Gabapentin](https://deserthopetreatment.com/sedatives/gabapentin-addiction/long-term-side-effects/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Antipsychotics\n\n**sometimes referred to as major tranquilizers or neuroleptics; risperidone, risperdal, quetiapine, seroquel, olanzapine, zyprexa, ziprasidone, zeldox, paliperidone, invega, aripiprazole, abilify, clozapine, clozaril, fluphenazine**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used as the first line treatment for schizophrenia & sometimes used for mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, Tourette's syndrome & Huntington's disease\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nMost drugs in this class work to block Dopamine, though some do impact other chemicals in the brain.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nOddly enough, memory seems to actually be improved when using an antipsychotic for a person with psychotic symptoms, though there are many that take medications within this class that are not psychotic. So let's talk about that more.\n\nWhy It Impacts Memory\n\nFirst, let's skip back to the purpose of these drugs. Schizophrenia is the **major** psychotic disorder we use antipsychotics for. Some of the main symptoms are delusions, lack of motivation, unusual behaviors, and hallucinations. Dopamine has been thought to regulate our brains understanding of our surroundings and what it all means to us. So, it's to be expected that drugs within this class target Dopamine.\n\nThis class is broken up into two categories;\n\n**First Generation (old, typical):** Block Dopamine-2 Receptors, which means they also block acetylcholine, histamine and norepinephrine. which do impact the complex way in which we store memories. \\*More movement disorders come with the old ones.\n\n**Second Generation: (new, atypical):** Block Serotonin and Dopamine Receptors**.** Less risk of extra movements, increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and weight gain.\n\nWhat do they all have in common? **They impact Dopamine.** Long story short; A delicate balance of Dopamine is needed for memory to function. Since this class targets Dopamine, it's fair to say it has the potential to alter our memory. Whether that's a good or bad thing is specific to the patient, but it's typically an unwelcome effect.\n\n# \n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Antihistamines\n\n**brompheniramine, dimetane, benadryl, diphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clistin, clemastine, tavist, doxylamine, unisom, hydroxyzine, atarax, vistaril, promethazine, phenergan, triprolidine, triafed**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used for allergies but also used for anxiety. Antihistamines are divided into different 'generations' & target different histamine receptors in our body.\n\n* H1 Receptors: Found Throughout the Body\n* H2 Receptors: Mostly Stomach Acid Secretion\n* H3 Receptors: Central Nervous System\n* H4 Receptors: Still Being Researched\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nWe're actually still learning a lot about histamines but what we do know is that **anti-**histamines are usually anticholinergic; **blocking** receptors for choline. The problem is that we need choline to be readily available to have the ability to learn, understand and remember.\n\n### Why it Impacts Memory?\n\nBeing that antihistamines are often anticholinergic, they do impair our ability to think, learn and remember. Especially the first generation antihistamines that easily penetrate our brain. We already naturally produce less acetylcholine overtime. This is partly why as we age our ability to remember, think, and learn diminishes. It's widely known that anticholinergics impact memory, thinking, learning, and muscle function. It is also suggested that these drugs increase the risk of developing dementia.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe only drug within this class that can be given intravenously is Benadryl. Since Benadryl is a first generation, it impacts our body in many ways in addition to the reason why it's administered. Since first generation antihistamines are much less specific in their effects, they are affiliated with greater memory impairment. Though, being the only IV antihistamine available, it is still widely used in hospital settings.\n\n### Summary\n\nOverall, the effects range. Regarding mental health specifically; Vistaril, hydroxyzine and Atarax are commonly prescribed for anxiety. While your risks are much less severe than benzodiazepines, these are FIRST generation antihistamines. Therefore, they do have a sedating effect (precisely why they can relieve tension) but this is also means they do impair our ability to remember.\n\nAn example of second generation antihistamines are Claritin & Zyrtec. Unlike first generation antihistamines, these do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. Therefore, they relieve many effects of allergies, but do not have as many sedating properties or memory impairments associated with them. When it comes to anxiety though, Claritin & Zyrtec won't do you much good.\n\nHope this helps clarify some of the impacts of memory and mental health medications.

Suffered, and worked out harder for about 6 weeks before seeing a doctor who Rx PT and nothing else. Failed PT (they told me to stop coming) and finally got imaging in Sept 2021 which showed L4/L5 disc problem causing pain. Did 2 steroid shots in October and November 2021, tried a chiropractor and more PT. Was miserable.\n\nJanuary 2022, saw a surgeon who recommended MD with laminectomy. I waited a few weeks so surgery would happen at end of my teaching term. The first surgery was on March 1, 2021, I felt a little better immediately after, but as soon as the steroid pack wore off, the pain was back and got WORSE. I was crying in agony and despair 2 - 4 weeks post-op. I called the surgeon's PA and did another MRI. when I went back for 6-week post-op, the surgeon said that a ligament had fallen into the space he created and he recommended another surgery ASAP. So 6 weeks after the first, on April 21, 2022, I had 2nd MD/laminectomy. Recovery went much better - until 6 weeks post-op when I suddenly had swelling at my incision site. The surgery team almost sent me stat to the OR but because of end-of-year craziness, I asked to watch and wait, and it did resolve but caused a MAJOR setback. Imaging showed swelling that started at the surgery site in the spine all the way to within a few millimeters of breaking through - so it ripped all the internal healing and I was back at square 1. It was miserable. In July and August I healed, worked through more pain, and started PT in September 2022. Things got progressively better but I did have a few setbacks - including right after I healed from COVID in December 2022 - I thought I was for sure back to the beginning, I was out of commission for a few days, but over the course of about 6 weeks, the pain got better. \n\nLingering pain led me to a new Physiatrist who is more holistic and led me to a pilates-based PT. I now do Pilates and walk almost every day. I've accepted I will likely always be 'high maintenance' and never back to some of my favorite activities (like mountain biking and white water rafting). I have a few more discs that are unstable, but I'm not in pain most days. Days I don't need any Advil feel like such a win and I've made it a week or more without needing pain relief - which is amazing. \n\nKeep trying new things when something doesn't work for you and keep the faith- it will get better."""

Many of those family members are also on medication for anxiety. This is all to just say, I knew it was coming but I didn\'t know how tough it would be.\n\nThis past Saturday I probably had my worse anxiety episode. I had had 2 panic/anxiety attacks in the past. The first one I was flying back home after a Job interview, and suddenly my heart started racing, my left hand began to tingle, and I felt out of breath. I was able to distract myself, make it through the flight, and by the time I was home I felt better. The second was earlier this year after I got my first COVID vaccine, and probably had the ""worst"" physical symptoms? In addition to the symptoms from the first panic attack my hands started to contract, my tongue felt swollen and I was slurring my speech a bit. The medical staff checked me out and within 5-10 minutes I had come down from the anxiety and was able to head home. In addition to those, recently I have been experiencing what I call ""mini"" episodes, where my heart rate elevates a bit and I feel anxious, but that\'s it. I had been considering speaking to a doctor about it, but never got around to scheduling the appointment. Saturday, however, it feels like the rug was pulled out from under me.\n\nI had a bit of a precursor event friday evening, usual mild anxiety episode, but it did take a bit longer than usual to calm down. I had had some more caffeine than usual, so I attributed it to that. I wnet to bed, slept fine, woke up Saturday morning and felt fine. I woke up a bit earlier than usual to watch a football game which wound up being a bit stressful, and may have tipped me over the edge. After the game, I felt anxious so I began to try what I had done in the past to calm down and nothing seemed to work. I was anxious for the rest of the day. I contacted my doctors office in the late afternoon and they prescribed me some xanax to help me calm down, and recommended I schedule an appointment to come in and discuss my anxiety (which I did, and has already happened). I went and got the xanax, came home, and took the dose they prescribed me (the lowest dose). Nothing. I reached out again, and they said I could take a little bit more since they had me on literally the lowest dose. That helped a bit, but when I went to go to bed it all came rushing back. I called my brother at that point and went to the ER, hoping there was something they could do to help me feel better and sleep. That visit amounted to waiting in the waiting room for a few hours, dosing off in the process, and finally calming down BEFORE being called back and talking with a doctor. Since I felt better, and my vitals were good (other than some high blood pressure the doctor attributed to the anxiety) the discharged me and I went home.\n\nThings have been better since then, but I\'m not back to my ""normal"" from before. My doctors appointment rolled around, and my PCP determined that I should start a daily medication for anxiety and begin some therapy to try to address my anxiety. Of course, now I am having anxiety about my medication and side effects even though I\'ve only been on it 2 days, and the only place I can seemingly avoid most anxiety now is laying in bed. I\'ve also had nausea of varying degrees since Saturday, but they have been a bit worse since starting my medication.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the toughest and scariest thing I\'ve ever dealt with in my life.

Idk how to spell it but feel puke-ish was abnormal for me but wasnt much concern.\n\nThe day after I woke up in a lot of pain, practically only on my left side, my entire left arm, my left ankle, some places of my left leg, the left half of my neck, my jaw and throat felt also only felt swollen on the left of my face. Not going to lie this was concerning and when I looked it up I couldnt find anything on it, I read about pain all over or pain just on the arm the vaccine was received (of course) but nothing about what was happening to me. I figured whatever as I should be feeling better soon anyways.  \n\nThe second day after receiving the vaccine I felt the same, pain only on the left side, except my back hurt all over but my back hurts almost every day anyways so that wasnt a concern. I felt feverish and had a headache.  \n\nThe third day (aka yesterday) my back hurt (like normal), but now the right side of my body hurt as well, and more, I could barely move either arm and they hurt different. My vaccine arm had sharp pains that came at random with my right arm felt like my left did the day after I got my vaccine. Like it literally hurts as if I got a shot on my right as well.   \n\nToday my back hurts 3x more than usual and I can barely move either arm, the left side of my throat is still tender and sore, I feel feverish again, feel like Im going to puke and just want to stop existing. As Im writing this my fingers are starting to get painful pins and needles (only my left hand).  \n\nThroughout this I have been taking Tylenol which somehow helps all pain except my arms and back. Im just so done with all this as I feel like I can barely function and every move is painful.   \n\nThis is the worst pain Ive felt that I can remember, I have a very high pain tolerance as I went through 2 broken arms when I was younger without needing a SINGLE pain med, just in this past 4 days Ive had around FIVE Tylenol. I also have a tic disorder so Im used to being in pain most days without having medication either, I can usually just power though.'"

No itching, no illness, I\'m perfectly healthy but it\'s super weird.It started out as a small pinkish circle, which I assumed to be a ringworm rash, and so I applied barmicil (mexican names) and vitacilina (vitacillin?) on it for varying periods and amounts since I didn\'t know the proper usage. I applied barmicil at the beginning and it seemed to kind of work for three days so I forgot about it.\n\nIt stayed for a while and got significantly larger in size (double/triple).\n\nI started getting worried in march and tried laying in the sun for about 25 minutes a day for a week or two. This made the area darken (which a dermatologist assumed it was due to the suns anti-inflammation properties) and what made it now its current state.\n\nAfter it darkened I went to my first dermatologist (MX), which diagnosed it as Lyme disease, she prescribed me doxycycline for 21-28 days (I forgot but the point is it didn\'t work) and made me get a test afterwards for the borrelia bacteria (which was negative). She then advised me to pigment the skin. I decided not to incase it was something serious and was my only symptom.\n\nMy second dermatologist is actually a relative of mine (US) and she is still on the case.\n\nThe only drug I\'ve used since this started was occasional ibuprofen (no effect on \'rash\').As I said before, no itching, no scales, no sickness, no bump, etc. The area is slightly numb but barely noticeable. I think it\'s been in it\'s current state for the past 3-4 months.\n\nI\'ll leave some pictures here:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o6nth49jy9a91.jpg?width=1850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e8f580c73f71f178658aeb6a79d2cd6f38c929e1\n\nAny questions feel free to ask!'"

Advil,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/x67cjo/sleep_and_death_anxiety/,b'Sleep and Death Anxiety',,"b""Hey everyone I'm new to this community and wanted to share my thoughts on something I've been going through: \n\nI have dealt with death anxiety to a crippling extent on and off for several years, starting in my mid teens for a few years, then rearing it's ugly head again when I'd all but forgotten the crippling experience, within weeks of me giving birth to my beautiful second child, a boy. Both times it reared its ugly head just as I was closing my eyes for an evening of rest. \n\nSo here's what I think is going on, I fight the urge to sleep, heavily. Why? Idk. With my death fear and anxiety comes depression, a lack of hunger, a lack of desire to just exist in the day, at its height I'd spend all day waiting to sleep, or wanting to sleep because I didn't want to feel these feelings anymore. But when the night came with each phase of exhaustion that washed over me I just couldn't close my eyes, I needed help, so I would take a sleeping aid like Midol PM or Advil PM or Benadryl after watching TikTok or TV mindlessly for usually hours to dissociate. \n\nI'm only recently becoming aware of this correlation but it's a definitive theme for me. Well no sooner did this issue dawn on me then an article shows up on my feed connecting disrupted circadian rhythms to mental illness. \n\nSo how did I becoke aware of this in myself? Well I started looking into Buddhism and other eastern teachings, my thought process was Christianity isn't helping me right now and materialism and scientific reductionsim isn't either or my SSRIs would be working. \n\nMy thought was this: Every night I drift off to sleep and sometimes I dream and sometimes I don't but I always wake up the next morning. If there's nothing after this life then that's okay, because sleep is nice and peaceful. It's hard to fully accept that as a young person but life helps us all towards the end to see this. Death is not the opposite of life but the opposite of birth. But then I stopped- \n\nIf I really feel that way about death, why do I fight so hard with sleep? Knowing full well I will in fact wake up the next day? How can I accept death when I can't even accept sleep?\n\nWell that I can't answer. I don't know what came first, my mental illness? My sleep issue? Who can say? I like sleep, as a young mother, I need it, I don't have nightmares often, a few series of them as a very young child, but overall I've had lots of good dreams too. \n\nSo I ask you all, have you noticed a similar correlation in your life on your own mental health journey? How correlated do you think these two things are? \n\nI'm going to try to accept sleep more often, and I hope that helps me in accepting other things that are natural and healthy like dying. If you have any tips on overcoming my resistance to rest without drugs let me know! \n\nhttps://neurosciencenews.com/circadian-rhythm-mental-health-21347/"""

I told him not to abuse medicine needed by others.  He said need is simply perception.  Here is my response.\n\nADHD is just as real as pain, both on a perceptual and a chemical level.  Every person diagnosed with ADHD has a different perception and tolerance level, much the same as everyone suffering from pain has a different perception and tolerance to the pain they are experiencing.  \n\nPain is caused by prostaglandins, the chemical responsible for both swelling and signaling to the brain that there is something wrong.  NSAIDs, the most popular category of OTC pain killers, stop pain and swelling by limiting the effect that prostaglandins have on the body.  Opiates act on several bases to alleviate pain.  They primarily act upon the Mu receptors, reducing the flow of painful stimulants.  They also act upon the limbic pathways, reducing the emotional response to pain.\n\nADHD is caused by a lack of neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) in the brain.  The brain of a person with ADHD is always in a constant state of desire for these neurotransmitters, exhibited by restlessness and distraction.  These constant external stimuli stimulate the brain to release a small amount of these neurotransmitters.  When one takes a stimulant (amphetamine, methylphenidate, cocaine, etc.), the brain either releases these neurotransmitters or blocks their reuptake, or both.  The more is taken, the more neurotransmitters are released.  When one with ADHD takes a stimulant, their levels of neurotransmitters rise to a level in which the brain is no longer in need of an external stimuli.  This allows for the person to function as a normal person.\n\n\nI won, though, sadly, he deleted his post.'"

Is it a dry socket and how is that possible?'",Image496,"b'As said in the title, I have a history of dry sockets. Out of the 7 previous teeth Ive had pulled, 4 have ended up with dry sockets (one of them was even an upper, which I know is not common). And here is possibly number 5 out of 8. \nIn addition to all those dry sockets, my first ever extraction experience led me to 6 weeks of incredible pain at the age of 22 due to osteomyelitis. \nSo needless to say, I have been terrified to get this most recent needed extraction (failed root canal). I planned it all out for months. My husband took time off of work to take care of the kids (and me), I quit smoking last October but just quit vaping 2 days before the procedure. I havent had a drop of alcohol. I have only eaten soft food (soup, yogurt, pudding and applesauce). I have been sleeping with my mouth open (since I clench at night, I usually create a vacuum in my mouth so I figured that might be the problem). I have done everything right. AND the blood clot is still in place from what I can tell. This pain is throbbing, and it seems to have progressively gotten worse after day one. Both ears feel like they are being pulled down, like a ton of pressure- but that started day one. My jaw now feels like its throbbing pain, and while the meds seem to help, its only for about an hour. The pain is much worse upon waking up just now, which is 6 hours after my last dose of hydrocodone/acetaminophen. That was the second time I took that kind, and I got super nauseous so I wont be taking that again. Other than that Ive been alternating ibuprofen and Tylenol, but I take one, it takes an hour to kick in, and then the pain relief is already fading an hour and a half later. \nMy question is, could this be a dry socket even if the blood clot was not disturbed? My oral surgeon put me on a course of z-pack, but could this instead be an infection?\nI plan to call in the morning, but Im just dumbfounded. \n\nMore in depth history: My lower wisdom tooth removal turned dry socket and then turned osteomyelitis on one side. The oral surgeon had no idea what was happening. He pulled out a piece of bone thinking that may have been the cause of the pain.

Im F(15/16), half Thai so I got quite some melanin in my skin. I started getting acne at age 8/9 (by that I mean Im turning 9 that year). It only got worse and in November 2018 I started tetracycline, worked pretty fine, but after almost half a year of it and trying to go without it, immediate outbreak. I ended up using tetracycline until last fall. At a certain time I stopped getting receipts while I was waiting to get back to a dermatologist. Beginning of December was when I finally started isotretinoin after half a year of consultations. 2 first week I did 20mg every other day, and by the time I began taking one pill every day. The symptoms got wild.\n\nAbout 3 days before Christmas I started experiencing daily nosebleeds, sometimes 3 to 5 times a day. My skin was sensitive, red, flaky, my lips was always drying out, flaked, bled- even my eyes are dry, my throat is dry, I easily become hoarse, my fucking ass is dry. A lot of headaches, joint pains, my back is killing me on a daily basis (and I used to dance for 5/6 years). I got to lower my dosage to 20mg every other day again (Im technically about halfway into my accutane treatment), the symptoms arent too bad now, but Im still sensitive. \n\nIve grown sensitive to milk, something I once drank over a liter of on a daily basis- very fat dairy product upset my stomach, so does bacon out of all things. Another funny thing is cum. Yes you heard that right. I had an allergic reaction to someones cum. Just jerked an ex, got his cum on my hand, immediately stung. It BURNED, swell up, red, itched, like acid! This was in early January and I still have flaky skin where it reacted and it looks like eczema. I know of seminal plasma hypersensitivity but it is such a rare thing. Has anyone else here experienced this? TBH, it only got worse now since the covid lockdown, disinfectants, frequent hand washing- it really irritates and dries me out. It also made me think of how I dont look forward until summer. Last year I got sunburnt for the first time in my life. In my face. I live within the damn polar circle where it doesnt get much higher than 15 Celsius. That was while I was on tetracycline. What Im scared and relieved about is that my treatment is ending in sometime June.\n\nHave any of you guys dealt with anything similar or heard of? \n\nHow do you deal with overly sensitive skin? \n\nHow do you suggest I protect my skin in the summer besides the obvious sun screen (I got 50+ spf, UVB + UVA protection that is meant for the face and fragrance free)\n\nAny other suggestions or advice?'"

The left bottom was a little complicated and he cut bone, so I got antibiotics and the pain was managed with Advil. I developed dry socket (bad taste, pain didn't get better) and was instructed to rinse with saline. Pain got better, but never went away, but it got to something like 0.1-0.5/10, so I figured that was that and I put off making an appointment. The pain was mostly in my jaw at that point. \n\nFlash forward to last week-- I started having more pain, including pain in my jaw, gum, and my ear. I made an appointment for last Thursday (4/15). Doc gave me an antibiotic rinse.\n\nSaturday 4/17-- pain gets worse. I get codeine and amoxicillin (allergic to PCN). \n\nSunday 4/18-- face swollen like I have the mumps. See the dentist again, he drains an abscess and pulls out a piece of bone. He explains that the bone died while I had dry socket and the fragment of bone caused an infection. Says I should feel better. Novocaine from the draining wore off while I was driving home and it was some of the worst pain of my life.\n\nMonday 4/19-- Switch to hydrocodone for pain because the codeine isn't working. The hydrocodone works no better, but whatever. Also switch to clindamycin every 6 hours. \n\nWednesday 4/21-- Swelling goes way down. Still swollen, but doesn't look like I have the mumps. Little to no change in pain; no change in treatment.\n\nThe pain is the same today, pretty awful. \n\nDoc plans on putting mesh over the dry socket tomorrow, which he says should help with the pain.\n\nRight now, my pain ranges from 5/10 to 9/10, averaging about an 8/10, and I spend a lot of time curled up in bed crying because of the pain. The lymph node under the jaw in particular is EXCRUCIATING. The inside of my mouth looks fairly normal other than swelling. I'm on q4 Advil and hydrocodone and q6 clindamycin and the pain is still incredible. I wasn't on any pain meds aside from occasional ibuprofen for either the extraction or the dry socket, so I'm not just being dramatic-- this is a whole other level. \n\nOther are duloxetine, dexmethylphenidate, synthroid, birth control, and migrelief vitamins  \nMedical history is Hashimoto's thyroiditis/hypothyroidism, migraines, depression, ADHD, autism\n\nAny advice would be fucking wonderful.

In general, I'm moving with my parents to Colorado and leaving behind grandparents, sister, brother in law, and best friends. It's been a constant state of near-panic and panic for months.  This had led to an increase in blood pressure, which was at 156/111 at the doctor's yesterday. She prescribed 25mg metoprolol in addition to my usual 100mg losartan, and this is bringing out some medication hypochondria in me. I'm worried about lowering my blood pressure too much, or stopping breathing in my sleep since I have bad apnea anyway.\n\nI'm writing right now because I can't fall asleep - I'm incredibly anxious. I want to take a Xanax, but I'm concerned about combining it with metoprolol and losartan. I hate taking regular Xanax so often also because I don't want to be dependant on it, but I equally hate this feeling. I even started taking just 50mg of losartan because I was feeling funny during the day and I attributed it to that.\n\nSorry for the rambling, I'm not sure where I'm going with this, but talking to someone felt important so I'm laying my story out for all you folks.

It didn't go away overnight so I went to a podiatrist the next morning. He said the spironolactone may be causing uric acid to build up and therefore causing the inflammation. He gave me naproxen and told me to take it twice a day for 10 days. Two days later, I go to work. Horrible stomach ache, chills, fever, dizzy, headache, cant seem to stay awake, very thirsty, no desire to eat but feel starved even after eating. \n\nI wasnt able to see a doctor because, well, I cant drive in this condition. I did text a friend whose a pharmacist and she was shocked I'd be prescribed an NSAID (naproxen) with spironolactone. She told me to drink pedialyte because I might be losing too many electrolytes. Spoke to another friend whose in rotations right now and he said that my taking omega-3 supplements would also not mix well with the drug. Basically my blood pressure might get too low, other meds increase chance of the side effects (which clearly seemed to be happening), etc. He basically called my doctor an idiot since I put all medications on my medical history. \n\nSo. problem now is that 1) I have abandoned all medications and I'm not sure what to take and how to take it. 2) My doctor and I don't mix with schedules until saturday morning\n\nWhich is why I'm hoping someone has some insight.

Ive attached an image of where the pain is. \n\nFor the numbness and tingling - It comes and goes but seems to be worse when Im sleeping (I sleep primarily on my sides, tossing and turning throughout the night). Sometimes the pain will be so hot and sharp that it wakes me from sleep.  It does happen throughout the day too. \n\nThe actual pain is in the heel of my hand and is relieved very slightly by massage. The tingling is in my entire arm and most of my fingers, excluding the pinky. I also have shoulder pain in both shoulders but Im unsure if this is related. \n\nI work an office job and am fairly sedentary, although I did start working out for 90 minutes a week a month or so ago. Nothing really hard or strenuous. \n\nIm just at a loss. I dont know if this sounds like its carpal tunnel or if Im just going to have to wait until August to find out. My doctor just really didnt seem concerned. I did reach back out to him to tell him the pain, numbness and tingling is impacting me daily but he just recommended adding Gabapentin and I really dont want to add another medication if I dont know the true cause.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.'"

Not intended to scare or deter anyone, just writing for awareness'",,"b'Hello everyone, I just wanted to write about my experience here just to maybe help anyone else out that may be going through something similar. This isn\'t meant to scare anyone to not taking Accutane as the drug effects everyone differently- my twin sister has had little to no side effects and we starting taking it at the same time. I just wanted to report that these side effects are indeed a possibility and manifest themselves in a way (at least for me) that can be almost unrecognizable until you\'re near the point of no return.\n\nI started taking my course at the end of December. I was honest with the psychiatrist I saw in order to get cleared to take accutane- as I child I was mildly depressed and took an antidepressant for around a year and a half until I was 15. As I grew up (22F), I was not depressed and did fine managing my school and work life. I have also had trouble sleeping throughout my life, but never anything bad enough that some benadryl couldn\'t fix. My psychiatrist also gave me trazodone to help me sleep, and it worked like a dream before I started taking accutane. \n\nMy first month was 40mg, and my second month I was bumped up to 60mg. I then was put down to 30mg because I developed terrible dry eyes where I had to use eye drops around every 30 minutes in order to see, drive, and study. Around the same time is when my sleep problem started to become pathological- at first I was only unable to nap, when before starting the course I was able to nap if I was tired enough. The trazodone stopped working, which I realize can happen on its own anyways- yet even high dosages (150mg +) could not help me sleep. Because of my lack of sleep, I quickly became depressed and suicidal. I\'m talking working two 12-hour shifts and still physically not being able to sleep for the next day. I was irritable, felt hopeless, and soon the incessant thoughts of suicide started. It was more passive suicidal ideation- thinking that it would be easier if it was all over/ if I was dead. My friends and family were all confused as I have never behaved or acted like this in my life- never have I had thoughts as persistent this. Still, I attributed it to whatever else was going on in my life- all of which is stress I have handled well throughout my entire life.\n\nNever in my mind did I think that any of this could be attributed to accutane as I asked my dermatologist if it may possibly effect sleep in any way- they blew me off saying ""No, it should make you more tired."" They also did not ask any questions when I told them I had suicidal thoughts in the appointment as they go down the checklist to check off which side effects you are having. Desperate for sleep I had started taking benzos occasionally that were prescribed to me- klonopin at first, and then halcion when that was ineffective to help me sleep. And then Xanax because of the stigma that is associated with halcion. I am well aware of the rebound insomnia/ anxiety that can be caused by benzos. Halcion was the only one that really could knock me out- yet sometimes even that would not do the trick. It is a strong medication, and fast-acting. With or without these medications, I have barely slept. I thought I was going crazy- all out of the blue, for no apparent reason. All of these symptoms started directly after starting my course- there were no major life changes, everything was going fine with my grades and social life.\n\nI made it to the end of my 5th month to even stop to think that these suicidal thoughts/ mental problems could be being caused/ magnified by accutane. My symptoms fit the warning to a T. I was a skeptic and thought it was a ridiculous notion until it actually happened to me. I was a completely different person 5 months ago. I just want people to be aware that this indeed is a possibility and to be in tune with your body and mind and look for warning signs before you are too far gone. Listen to people around you when they say they see a change in yourself- some of these things are hard to see when you are that deep into depression. I am stopping my course and all other meds and focusing on getting well. Please take care of yourselves accutane users! \n\n\n\n'"

Thoughts?',,"b'To be very clear from the start, I\'m not planning to kill myself, but wanted to talk about a fear that I have.\n\nI am more or less on 3 medications at once to fix 2 primary issues I have: Extreme anxiety (especially social anxiety) and what I believe to be undiagnosed ADHD.\n\nFor Anxiety:\n\n* Clonazepam 0.25mg\n\n  * I was prescribed Clonazepam for anxiety relief. I believe it works pretty effectively even on the small 0.25mg dosage Im on\n\n* Escitalopram 10mg\n\n  * I believe I was prescribed the for anxiety and depression and this should take 4-8 weeks to kick in (I\'m about 2 and a half weeks into this)\n\nFor ADHD:\n\n* Adderall XR 10mg\n\n  * I believe I was prescribed this for the adhd (they say the plan is to increase this every 2 weeks until I get the desired effect). So far I think it *might* be helping??? but its too close to placebo to call effective. I have noticed feeling less hungry though, which is great.\n\n---\n\nOk, context out of the way, what are my fears?\n\nThe recommended instructions for Clonazepam say to take 2 per day as needed (which I assume to mean that I don\'t take it on days I am not in anxiety filled situations. The psychiatrist said they expect Ill take one a day in the morning (where I said the most anxiety comes usually from a scheduled work meeting).\n\nThe last weekend I did so anyways, but this weekend did not.\n\nThis monday morning early morning like 3AM (I didn\'t really get much sleep so this is when I woke up), I felt fucking awful. Like I lay there anxious as I\'ve ever been with no particular thoughts about anything anxiety inducing in particular but just kept thinking ""I should just fucking kill myself and be done with it"" and dreaming of the blissful lack of pain/fade to white and then nothing at the end of jumping off a tall building.\n\nThe whole time I realized this was super unhealthy and uncharacteristically strong. Like for the past ... over a decade of my life I have generally been depressed and thought casually , but never with strong emotion about it, and I still maintain that my plan is to only see it as an option when my options for trying to treat it seem like they are running out (in practical terms meaning that after I\'ve tried with at least one more psychiatrist if this doesn\'t work out, gotten a psychologist I vibe with this psychiatrist etc) I would throw in the towel.\n\nAnyhow my point here is, for around 2 weeks I have been much less anxiety filled and have had a much less depressed mood than normal with hope for my future given the positive effects I had seen with both the Adderall and Clonazepam. I don\'t feel like I was actually at any danger of killing myself, but the emotion to do so so suddenly despite my the previous 2 weeks or so of a heightened mood has me worried about my medications.\n\nIs it the Escitalopram with the rare side effects of suicide ideation or is it my not taking clonazepam for one day? \n I knew clonazepam built up dependency, but is it that quickly??? \n\nI don\'t know the answers to any of those, but it was genuinely extremely scary. Like someone had pointed a depression/anxiety-anator at my head and pulled the trigger.\n\nHas anyone experienced anything like this?\n\nI think I\'m going to continue taking everything as prescribed every day, and bring this up with my psychiatrist when I meet them again next week, but I thought Id leave this here with the hopes to get some opinions, thoughts, and potentially some information for anyone who runs into my situation in the future and wonders if they are alone in this.'"

I also quit caffeine for 3 months and I am now struggling with nicotine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will try to explain it as quick as possible, because there are many details. For 2 years I have had a problem with the pelvis, one side is lower, the other is higher. I have been to a chiropractor in Germany 3 times, they told me to go to an orthopedist and have it x-rayed. After returning to my country, I have X-rayed my pelvis, anatomically everything is fine. The orthopedist referred me to physical therapy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo the point, when I took MDMA for the first time in my life, for about 16 hours my body straightened up automatically, I had no problems with balance, the pelvis was straight and the gait was steady. Like 70% symptom reduction.\n\nMDMA - dopamine (less), serotonin (a lot), noradrenaline\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere it gets more interesting, some time later I took amphetamines, the problem disappeared in 99% for about 15 hours, straight body, perfect balance, steady gait.\n\namphetamine - dopamine (more), serotonin (little), noradrenaline\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDopamine deficiency leads to Parkinson\'s disease (an extreme deficiency). However, dopamine deficiencies also lead to problems with balance and muscle strength, some muscle contractions and more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went a little crazy one weekend and bought 5-htp for regeneration after the weekend on MDMA, plus l-tyrosine, because I read that 5-htp in too much reduces dopamine. I\'ve been taking 600-800mg daily of 5htp for about a week and 2g of L-Tyrosine. And here it gets interesting, the comedown after MDMA has actually passed, but I fell into an even worse pit, probably dopamine deficiency by too much 5htp, next time I trust nature and the processes in the body and just buy l-tryptophan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter this treatment with 5-htp and tyrosine - amphetamine did not work on me, normally 1 cm path would be enough, I had to take 5x1 cm, I\'m giving such a comparative scale because I am sensitive to any stimulant and usually take very trace doses of such substances, just to break down to having fun and forcing the rest by myself, something like social therapy.  So I thought that 5htp lowered dopamine in my brain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEverything correlates with each other, I told my physiotherapist that when I feel psychologically worse, my body goes crazy when it feels good - it is slightly better, I also told him that I had tried substances such as MDMA, amphetamines or LSD and after these substances my posture leveled itself. He suggested that maybe I should go to a therapist, maybe I have some suppressed emotions and my body reacts to stress this way. However, I think that my head is good, because I feel good with myself, I have no serious problems in life, only this problem with the pelvis, which takes away all my confidence because I cannot stand up straight and be focused, I am not ""here and now "", I\'m wandering in my head because muscle tension and bad balance throws me out of the flow of life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter reading over a dozen scientific studies on all of the topics mentioned here, from physiotherapy, the effects of stress on posture, MDMA, serotonin, and LSD. I have come to the conclusion that I have a disturbed chemistry in my head. Only previously thought that this problem was caused by a lack of serotonin, not dopamine. Amphetamines clarified this point for me. After amphetamines and LSD, 99% of the condition was cured (for about 15 hours).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know it all sounds weird, it\'s also hard for me to describe it so that it doesn\'t take a few A4 pages, because I did a lot of research on my problem on my own, because I have already spent a lot of money on physiotherapists and there is a MINIMUM improvement. In general, since I was a child, I have been interested in some way in antidepressants, psychoactive substances, dietary supplements, vitamins, minerals, etc. Everything that affects our chemistry in the body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that after so many years of looking for a solution, I came across it by accident while at a party in a techno club where I enjoyed the moments when I can walk normally. In fact, it was after the party when I started to analyze it all. I just miss dopamine. L-tyrosine 3g a day plus L-tryptophan 3g for the night and after some time my body and head will return to balance?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell me what you think, I\'m curious about your opinion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition, I smoked marijuana daily for 2 years, stopped for 3 months and smoked only sporadically and little after that, however, I saw that I feel weak after smoking mentally and the problem with muscle tension is even worse after marijuana. Is it possible that heavy marihana smoking - 0.5-1g a day has burst all my dopamine reserves? But why now do I feel bad and not good after marijuana?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt gets weird here too, when i was smoking from a pipe, it was bad for me. I once smoked a gravity bong to be sure why weed is not working for me like it should (relaxing). I felt better after a gravity bong than when smoking from a pipe (the same amount of the same marijuana). Why it is working in a different way? Different neurotransmitters levels when smoking everything at once than by taking puffs from pipe?'"

I am not excited that any of us are on this subreddit, but at least we have each other?\n\nI\'m a 26 year old female, somewhat active and not overweight. In October 2019, I ran a 5K that involved obstacles. I felt great during it and had a lot of fun. I can\'t pinpoint exactly when my injury happened, but I have to assume that it happened during one of the 6 ft wall jumps. I woke up the next day feeling slightly tender in my hamstring area on the right side. I assumed that this was what it felt like to pull a hamstring and I decided to just give it a rest and let it heal on its own. \n\nI stopped running for about 2 weeks and then started up again. I was feeling very sore in the hamstring area but didn\'t really think anything of it. Then it started to get worse. I distinctly remember standing up out of my car and I felt a shooting pain that brought tears to my eyes. It never really got better from there. Around the first of the year, I scheduled an appointment with an orthopedic doctor that my friend had recommended to me. I was still thinking at the time that the problem was with my hamstring. I had no clue that it was related to my back. He manipulated my leg moved me around, and almost instantaneously said, ""this has nothing to do with your hamstring - this is related to your L5S1."" He said that because I am young he recommended that I go through physical therapy and stretches and then follow up with him in about a month.\n\nI got about two weeks into physical therapy, and was feeling pretty good. I was still hurting when I stood up and when I stretched, but the shooting pains were a lot less painful. Then, I had an appointment one day that involved a resistance band, and my pain got five times worse. All of a sudden, instead of just having hamstring pain when I stretched or stood up, I had pain that radiated from my hip down to my foot 24/7. I kept doing physical therapy thinking it was part of it. Sometimes my foot is tingly and I lose toe sensation. Immediately upon my follow up appointment a month later, my doctor ordered an MRI.\n\nThe MRI showed not only a herniation with impingement at L5S1, but also a herniation at L4. While I was disappointed to learn that it was a little bit more serious than I had originally thought, it was good to finally have a diagnostic answer.\n\nWe have stopped the physical therapy for now, but I am in so much pain and it only gets worse by the day. I can\'t do any of the Stuart McGill big 3 exercises because it hurts too much. The doctor prescribed me 1,200 mg per day of Gabapentin, but I can never get past 600 per day (Even if I take most of it for bed) without being utterly useless at work. I basically feel like I am drunk even on the lower doses. \n\nWith the opinion of a second spine specialist at the same clinic, they recommended that I get an epidural steroid injection. I received my steroid injection on Wednesday March 4th, but so far the pain has only increased, and it has been 5 days since the injection. I have gotten no relief from the first injection. The clinic where I received my injection said that I may need to come back for a second injection, but part of me does not want to even waste my time if that won\'t work either. I am desperate because I am half hopeful that the steroid injections will work, but I am half pessimistic that they will not do anything like the first shot. The spine specialist told me that if these injections are not working for me, my follow-up on March 20th may involve a sit-down conversation with a surgeon. I wanted to be one of those people in this sub who healed simply from stretching, but I can\'t even do that. I am so frustrated and I just want my life back.\n\nI can\'t drive without intense pain, I can\'t sleep well at all no matter how many positions or pillows I try, I can\'t sit through work or get anything done, I can\'t do household chores either. Even trying to take NSAIDS or acetomenophen (or both) with or without the Gabapentin has not worked.\n\nSometimes I scroll through this sub and see people who have had this pain for years and have not gotten an MRI yet or people who manage to get past the pain using the Stuart McGill methods. And I have no idea whether or not I am being overly dramatic thinking that surgery may be the only choice I have left 5 months post injury. I have stopped bothering to talk to Friends my age about this issue because they all start spouting out random things about yoga as if I can even slightly bend my knee without pain.'"

I'm very apprehensive about getting my booster on January 10th, but my doctor has assured me that it is safe & recommended to still go ahead.\n\n1st Vaccine of Pfizer: 13th June 2021\n\n2nd Vaccine of Pfizer: 9th August 2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter my 1st vaccine I experienced no symptoms after, apart from a sore arm for a couple of days.\n\nAt the beginning of August I noticed that a red mark on my lower abdomen (which had been there for a little while, but didn't think anything of it), was still present and was getting bigger and not going away. I now think that it must have been there for at least a month prior? But cannot say for certain. Must have been end of June/early July?\n\nAlso at the time I had been experiencing eye redness. I have been a regular contact lens wearer for years, and haven't had ANY issues. At first I thought that I had scratched my eye, causing one eye to go a bit red. So I wore my glasses for a while until it reduced. However for the next 3 months or so, one or both eyes would go red after wearing my contact lenses, sometimes after a day or a couple of days. I spoke to my optician about this, and they couldn't explain why.  My contact lens brand and solution has always been the same, they just recommended giving my eyes a longer break of wearing contacts to see if that would help... however, I would wear my glasses for weeks at a time, but my eyes would go red again after going back to my contacts. It was super frustrating as I didn't know why.\n\nMeanwhile I contacted my GP at the beginning of August, just before my 2nd vaccine about this mysterious mark. She couldn't really explain what it was, but told me to apply different creams on it for the next 2 weeks and it should clear up.\n\nI had my 2nd vaccine on the 9th August. There was a lot of bad press about vaccine online, especially with young people getting bad after effects/ reactions. I'm quite an anxious person, especially when it comes to anything health or medical related. The same evening I started to feel a bit achey, but I thought that that was it. I did take the following day off from work, but went back as normal on the 11th.\n\nOn the 11th I did experience some weird symptoms, but looking back now, I think it was me being hypersensitive & overanalysing how I was feeling. I experienced a 'pins and needles' sensation in my lower legs, dizziness (felt like I was swaying on a boat), muscle weakness, headaches... all of which lasted 1-2 weeks. Now I'm pretty sure these were all just my anxiety making me go into overdrive.\n\nHowever, while this was all happening, I had the added stress of my rash spreading. From around the 15th I started to notice small little patches appear over my stomach and chest. I continued to take photos of the progression for myself and my doctor's reference. I had no irritation, they were't visibly dry or flaky either. They would just appear small, and then slowly spread over time.\n\nAfter 2 weeks had passed since talking to the doctor about this rash I went back & a different doctor prescribed me a stronger antihistamine cream to try for another 2 weeks. But again, this had no obvious effect & the rash continued to spread. After another week or so, a different doctor told me that it looked like Pityriasis Rosea, despite me not having some of the typical characteristics e.g a dry/flaky appearance. I was told to stop putting anything on it & to just let it run its course for another fortnight.\n\nThe rash reached its worst around the 20th September, 6 weeks after my 2nd vaccine, and possibly 11 or 12 weeks after it first started? It was mainly located on my front, across my chest and stomach and a few patches on my side and upper back. I had a couple isolated patched on my arms and legs.\n\nFor the next 3 weeks they proceeded to fade, and by 11th October they had pretty much disappeared. The weird thing is that all of this time I kept getting the same problems with my eyes going red. However since my rash has cleared up, so has the problems with my eyes. I've not had any redness since, so they must be connected? But I couldn't find any link of eye inflammation to Pityriasis Rosea online? Maybe it's because they weren't red all of the time, but my eyes just seemed to be hypersensitive to me wearing my contacts?\n\nSo I've got my 3rd vaccine/booster booked for January 10th, and I'm going into it with apprehension given the symptoms that I've experienced in the past. I know that it's likely to be a 'one off' thing, and shouldn't happen again, but would really like to hear other people's experiences?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPhotos:\n\n1st August - First 'herald ' patch (it was smaller than this to begin with): [https://i.imgur.com/JRdZ8kJ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/JRdZ8kJ.jpg)\n\n31st August - Rash starting to spread: [https://i.imgur.com/jAeXf9k.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/jAeXf9k.jpg)\n\n20th September - Rash at its worst: [https://i.imgur.com/Fj6lwyP.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Fj6lwyP.jpg)\n\n4th October - Rash starting to fade: [https://i.imgur.com/4scp49T.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/4scp49T.jpg)\n\nExample of eye inflammation/redness, 2nd August: [https://i.imgur.com/3bZh58a.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/3bZh58a.jpg) & 1st September: [https://i.imgur.com/hS4b6pE.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/hS4b6pE.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;"""

In February I was also diagnosed for ADHD and been on dexamphetamine 4x12.5 mg a day (Amfexa, it's called Tentin in the Netherlands) ever since. The medication really helped me, although it did increase some psychical anxiety symptoms. \n\nNow recently my anxiety has been increasing a lot, and I finally decided that it would be time to try citalopram. I am starting psychotherapy in a month, and my psychologist suggested that it would be benefiticial to start a combination of dex and the SSRI together with the therapy itself. \n\nNow, I am very hesistant and anxious to try citalopram as I rarely read any experiences of similar stimulant + SSRI combinations. Furthermore, drug interactions online mention that it is not possible to combine a stimulant and SSRI, even though multiple psychologists and two psychiatrists keep telling me that it is possible.. ? Therefore, I would really appreciate it to hear some fellow ADHD'-ers with the combination of stimulants and SSRI for OCD/anxiety. Is there a reason for me to be so anxious, especially about the side effects? I am just terrified that my OCD or anxiety will increase even more and spiral out of control. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSidenote: My psychiatrist said that I should try 2 mg of citalopram for 2-3 days, and increase by 2 mg every 2-3 days until 20 mg to minimize the side effects.

I am a 30yo Caucasian male living in B.C. Canada, and the last few weeks have been quite troubling, experiencing an array of strange destressing physical and psychological symptoms. \n\nI took serious notice about three weeks ago, but thinking back I think it may have started earlier without me realizing, as my mental state seemed to be in unexplained decline for a week or so prior. \n\n^^^^^\n\nI do suffer from long term depression, anxiety, and addiction (On suboxone and also self medicate with vyvanse and ritalin daily at a typical ADHD dosage, as well as clonazepam a couple times a week when needed, all of the above at the same dosage for years so with no changes so I don't think it's related to that)\n\nIt started with waking up really groggy and unrested a few weeks ago, which I struggle with from time to time but it was extra intense and I also was experiencing much more dissociation and depersonalization than normal which i've also struggled with for over ten years. This was just a few weeks after a period where I was using psilocybin for the first time therapeutically, and it was a mental health breakthrough for me. I had never felt so confident and optimistic about my situation and the future, so this sudden drop in well being was a curveball for me.\n\n^^^^^\n\nThe same week that the intense brain fog kicked in, I also had a dull headache behind the eyes and dull joint pain/back pain that first lasted a few days. On day 4-5, things started getting really bad, I started feeling very strange and very out of it 24/7, and knowing how anxiety and depression effects me long term, this was very unusual and I had a strong sense that it wasn't psychological in nature. For a few days I also had this feeling of numbness that was both physical and mental, it felt strange to touch my skin, as if I was anesthetized, a dull tingly feeling all over my body but also mentally, I was very slow cognitively. I was sensitive to temperature as well, and on the night before the blood test I woke up a number of times feeling hot, but didn't get a chance to see if I had a fever.\n\nI called a doctor and went for blood tests, but the day of the blood test I felt most of the numbness and intense fatigue symptoms subsided. I checked my results a couple days later and everything looked normal besides being just below normal range in hemoglobin, and I have a follow up appointment in a couple days in which I will be reporting all my latest symptoms.\n\n^^^^^\n\nThings got weirder though, for 2-3 days after the blood test I felt a lot better physically, but was still having much higher than normal dissociation and symptoms of stress/depression. Then, after a few days of feeling like maybe I was getting better I started feeling extremely depressed, with extreme anhedonia, a lot of intrusive thoughts and dread, which despite suffering from many mental health low points over the years, this was more intense and seemed to be beyond my conscious influence as there were no moments where it let up, it was very consistent. After a few days of feeling like I was on the brink of having some sort of unexplained breakdown I started getting some more pain, dull back pain, and then I woke up one morning to notice that I was getting random muscle twitches all over my body, which started three days ago and has been consistent since then and not something I have experienced before. It feels like there is some electrical malfunction with my nervous system, and it feels as if my body is under some constant electrical voltage if that makes any sense. Every 30 seconds to a minute I have a small muscle twitch in a completely different area on my body, even muscles I normally don't have control over.\n\n^^^^^\n\nAnd then two days ago, I also realized that I hadn't had a bowel movement what must be over a week now, which is very very bizarre because my appetite has been normal and I didn't feel any discomfort until it crossed my mind, I just came to the realization one day that I hadn't had one in a loooong time, 2-3x longer than I remember ever waiting, and now two days later, I still haven't and it's incredibly strange as i've been eating constantly and don't even really feel bloated or plugged up except for today in which i'm starting to feel some intestinal pressure. I took magnesium citrate last night because it previously made me run to the toilet (that's not why I had taken it but I switched to another magnesium supplement due to that side effect) and so far it's done nothing.  As of now i'm just starting to get a stomach ache for the first time, I have some lower back pain, and I just feel this vague but deep sense that there is something wrong, i'm high strung and feel unconsciously tense, I can relax my muscles fine but there is an underlying sense of tension through my body and mind, and still twitching as I type this. And I am still feeling dissociated (depersonalization) a lot, like the most i've been in ten years over the past few weeks, which is saying a lot because it used to dominate my life and I really thought I had gotten over it, I don't have panic attacks anymore, but it still just presents itself and disconnects me from my surroundings and there is nothing I can do about it. There is just no comparison to how I feel now VS 1-2 months ago, I really felt amazing, was starting to get my life in order, and now that feels like another lifetime, even the memory of it feels fuzzy and if I didn't keep a journal I might not even believe it was my reality because it seems so far away from where I am now.\n\n^^^^^\n\nIf one or two of the above had happened, I would have called it coincidence, but there is just no way that I am getting such a range of specific symptoms that I normally don't suffer from without any chance in diet or activity, I just can't wrap my head around it and there are no conditions I can find online that match the list of symptoms. I tested negative for covid during the peak of me feeling ill last week too. Is there any condition that even has a slim possibility of causing all of the above??"""

I was recently diagnosed with ADHD about a month and a half ago. I am Bipolar 2 as well. Ive been on Lamotrigine 200mg and Wellbutrin 300mg for quite sometime (5 months or so). That worked well for me in terms of regulating my impulse control and depression. I just started vyvanse 30mg two weeks ago and my doctor lowered my Wellbutrin to 150mg. I was first prescribed Concerta but because of the shortage I was not able to get it. \n\nSince adding Vyvanse in the mix I have been feeling way more focused, organized, patient and less irritable & anxious . Thats why I dont want to get off of it. But Ive noticed some negative changes. My biggest problem I have when manic is impulse control. Since starting Ive felt that my impulse control has been hard to control. It feels like Im gradually losing control. My biggest impulse issue is money management. I have been able to regulate my shopping habits before but now Im obsessively online shopping and constantly thinking about things I want to buy but dont need or have the money to spend on. Ive already impulsively spent $100+ on activewear when I already have 20+ pairs of leggings and sports bras. Ive bought countless items on Amazon as well. \n\nMy doctor was talking to me about the possibility that I could get into a hypomanic state, I dont remember if she was referring to the mix of Vyvanse and Wellbutrin or Vyvanse and Lamotrigine. She told me we would drop one of those medications if mania occurs. I know I havent been on it for long and I want to give it a chance to mellow out, but If this possible hypomanic state persists I definitely will need to stop.  \n\nIm wondering if anyone out there has had this experience with taking these specific medications together and can give me some sort of reassurance. I will definitely be talking to my doctor about this next appointment.\n\nTIA ('')"""

I dare to guess, my insomnia is a case of autoimmune disorder because it happened after 2 shots of Moderna Covid vaccine and it also happened after the Pfizer booster. My PCP prescribed Trazodone and my sleep medicine doctor also assured me Trazodone is safe and not addictive. My sleep medicine doctor used Trazodone to reset my sleep pattern which she has good results with over 3 months. Then she started tapering. I was good stepping down from 250mg to 150mg. But when she put me on an alternating schedule of 150mg and 100mg, my body reacted. My sleep started crashing and spiking from night to night. Many nights in a row, I just woke up after 3 hours of sleep and couldn't go back to sleep (sleep maintenance issue). She stopped the tapering and put me back on 150, 200, and 250 after every 2 weeks. Didn't work for any of the dosage. I am in total mercy of Trazodone now. Never knew if I could sleep, or sleep little or sleep the whole night when I go to bed. It has been over 2 months, I am so tired with this yo-yo sleep. I am 70 years old. Don't have the strength and endurance for this torture.

dilaudid,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/ko1167/full_summary_about_music_that_movie_by_sia/,"b'Full Summary about ""Music"" that movie by Sia'",,"b' This was originally written by u/isabellas123\n\n\\*\\*SPOILERS!! \\*\\* If you dont want spoilers do not read further.\n\nFirst off I would like to say that this is not Maddies fault she was only 14 at the time and trusted Sia.\n\nIn regards to the film plot. The movie is of course about an autistic teenager named Music. Although, apparently Sia never felt the need to actually refer to Music as Autistic in the film (unlike what shes done in every interview since filming, where she has told the world that the character is autistic) unfortunately in the movie Music is only referred to as someone who has special needs.\n\nThe very first scene of the movie shows Music in her underwear getting dressed, as she is moaning and hitting her legs with her fist. It is then followed by a music clip of Music dancing around, with the same faces and moves as seen in all of the Sia/Maddie music video. The next scene is where you first get to see Maddie act the role of Music as shes getting dressed in the morning. (To say it lightly the photos everyone saw of Maddie from the filming of the movie, is exactly what she does during the entire film). We see as her grandmother makes Music her smiley face eggs and braids her hair.\n\nAs the film continues Music goes on her daily walk around the neighborhood, where the neighbors assist her secretly as she does her walk to the library. When she comes back home her grandmother/only caretaker is on the floor, unconscious. She sits down where she normally sits kinda glancing at her and makes noises suggesting she is distressed about what she is seeing. The building owner knocks and comes in and finds music and her grandmother. He tries to comfort Music as she is moaning and becoming upset. He calls the police, and Music is left standing alone while her grandmothers body is wheeled out of the apartment.\n\nGoing on Zu gets told that she is going to have to take care of Music herself since she is all she has now. Zu moves into the apartment, where she was left alone, to take care of Music. That morning Zu is woken up by Music who is yelling and pulling on her to make you eggs, make you eggs so Zu tries to make Musics smiley face eggs. Music then wants Zu to braid your hair when Zu doesnt, Music begins to have a meltdown (the first of three I may add). Zu cant consult her and luckily Ebo, Leslie Odem Jr character, knocks on the door and then jumps on top of Music until she calms down.\n\nThe movie continues and we hear more about Zus life of being a sober drug dealer and more of Ebo who teaches at a gym. We also meet Felix, a young boy who is Musics neighbor and trains at the gym Ebo works at. Felix is always watching Music like they have a special bond, although Ebo and Music never actually communicate in anyway (this was so weird to me, he would just pop up in places watching her. It made me so uncomfortable). Ebo even flashes his flash light (from his room across the street) on Musics wall, illuminating her photos of dogs, where we see another one of Sias musical scenes of Music dancing with a human size dog. Maddie sings for this scene. *Felix has his own little story line in the film with a dramatic ending, but I wont touch on that*\n\nWe then go on another walk where Zu and Ebo talk about their lives and Ebo explains more about how Music thinks. (This is the scene where many of the paparazzi photos, weve seen, were taken) Music is walking behind them as many kids run by and she has her second meltdown of the film. As she runs around the park screaming and hitting her head. Zu and Ebo are trying to decide who should jump on her. Ultimately it ends up being Zu since Ebo said Im not jumping on top of a small screaming white girl in the middle of this park. So Zu jumps on top of Music as Ebo helps coach Zu on how to calm Music down. (This scene was captured in some of the paparazzi photos, also) Once the meltdown is over Zu get Music a rainbow snow cone.\n\nWe then see some scenes of Music and Zu bonding interweaved with some music scenes also including Ebo as he and Zu get closer. Theres also a scene of Edo playing the piano while Zu sings and Music listens and enjoys in the background.\n\nMoving on, Zu has a big job that she must go to (remember she is a sober drug dealer) and tries to find someone to watch Music. When she cannot find someone, Music comes to the job with her. In the elevator, up to the job, we see Zu and Music, where Zu is asking Music to try and not have one of your freak outs as she doesnt know these clients and wants to keep this job, so she wants Music to get it out now. The elevator lets them out on the set of photo shoot where Music begins to make loud nosies and heads for the set decorations, so Zu has to go sit her down. The photoshoot director then tells Zu that they need percocet, morphine, dilaudid, and oxycontin and once again Music is touching the set decorations and Zu must stop what shes doing to get Music. Once she gets Music to settle down we get to see who the photoshoot is for. Surprise surprise the shoot is for Sia! Shocker. Sia begins to scream DRUG DEALER, DRUG DEALER, are you the drug dealer. Zu heads to her and ask what she needs. Sia tells her the drugs they are buying are for charity work, and will be sent to Hadi because of an earthquake and kids need to have their bones put back together, but are only given Tylenol. So what ever Zu can get in by tomorrow, Sia will buy and fly them over there in her private jet. Pop Stars Without Borders is what Sia calls it. This scene is ended by Music getting into the wardrobe and we see another musical scene of her and Zu in crazy outfits dancing around. You can hear Maddie singing in this scene, as well.\n\nThen we go on another walk. While Zu is getting Music another rainbow snow cone, Music climbs under a bench and starts eating gum off of the bottom of it. Zu yells at her and then Music gets stung by a bee, where another meltdown occurs and theres screamed and hitting again. Music is ultimately allergic and Zu has to rush/carry her to the hospital. Zu is informed that Music had an EpiPen in the fanny pack that she should have used. Frustrated Zu realizes she left her backpack containing Sias drugs by the snow cone cart. She rushes back with Music (who although, after being in the hospital, and had a severe allergic reaction, which caused dramatic face swelling and redness, is perfectly fine/healed and walks back to the park just a little while later) and the drugs are no where to be found.\n\nAfter this Zu is over it. We see this as she decides to start using drugs again. Followed by another music scene if I remember corrected. The next scene we see Zu passed out on the couch with blood all over her face and is woken up by Music who walks in with a pee stain on the back of her pants because she wet the bed. Music gets cleaned up and heads out for her daily walk. Ebo comes in and finds out Zu relapsed which angers him and he leaves Zu.\n\nZu then decides she cant do it anymore. She needs to focus on herself before trying to take care of Music. Zu finds a facility for Music where Zu plans to leave her. They sit on the medical bed together and Music tells her to not go. They hold hands and then Zu comes to her senses so they bust out of there.\n\nZu heads to find Ebo. She finds him at his brothers wedding, she ask for forgiveness and says how much she needs him, and that shes going to be a better person. (along those terms) Then Ebo sits down to play the piano to sing the song they played earlier in the film, but as a surprise to them, as Ebo begins to play and Zu begins to sing. Music begins to sing the song. This scene ends with Music singing as Ebo plays.\n\nFinally, the film ends with them all together happy, as Zu is preparing Musics 3 eyed happy face eggs. Followed by the music video for Together as the credits roll.\n\n\n\nHere is my OPINION, if youre not interested in my opinion of this film do not read further. If you do not agree thats fine. This is only my opinion doesnt mean I am right. Other people can feel differently.\n\nOverall the film deserves every critique that its gotten. The character would have been much better played by someone, any where, on the spectrum. The dance scenes did not include any trained danced techniques, so Sia saying she needed someone who could dance is not only insulting, by thinking someone with autism couldnt do these simple dances, but also not the truth. The way Maddie plays the character is so offensive. Not only is it extremely stereotypical. The faces are nonstop, I mean nonstop. Constantly changing expressions, constantly moving neck. Mouth open, teeth out, mouth closed, eyes open, eyes close, touch tooth, touch fingers, hard blink, itch eye, stick out pout lip, look sideways. Look everywhere. Its this over and over again, in every scene. Also the fact that Maddie is known really hurts the character. Its just feels so wrong to watch Maddie try to play someone with this type of disability. There were times while watching Maddie that I was overwhelmed with emotion and it wasnt because the filmed touched me, it was because I felt like it was being portrayed so disrespectfully that it upset me. The film used autistic meltdowns three times as entertainment, which is absolutely disgusting. Not to mention they thanked autism speaks in the credits. Besides all the obvious, the storyline just isnt great either. Overall I would not recommend the film to anyone.'"

Also I realize after writing this that it kind of sounds like Im asking for a diagnosis but I promise Im not, Im more just venting and asking for peoples opinions who may have gone through similar situations.\n\nFirst a little background on me, I am a 27 year old male, Ive never had any trouble with my mental health up to this point, even after going through some very traumatic family scenes, and have dealt with my stress very well in my opinion. I am a sufferer of Crohns disease, have been diagnosed with it since I was in the 3rd grade but even that has never bothered me mentally. I was working out consistently, making good progress in strength and my physique and was feeling pretty confident in myself, I was studying for my new job willingly, I actually enjoyed studying it every day. But all of a sudden things fell apart on me.\n\nIt seemed to just hit me out of absolutely nowhere 2 weeks ago and has been going on ever since, the night it started I was going to bed and my nose was clogged and my ear felt like there was fluid buildup and I couldnt breathe very well and for some reason I got extremely agitated and worked myself into a panic because I couldnt go to sleep as a result of it. This happened once before too a few months ago, but at that time I was very sick with a terrible sinus infection but once my nose cleared then I was able to go to sleep perfectly fine. But this time the mental effect has seemed to stick around because I think I've associated nose congestion and fluid in ear feeling with not being able to sleep. Even though this time I was not really sick (maybe just a small cold), and can actually breathe good again now, I still cannot for the life of me fall asleep and worry to death all day about not being able to sleep and I feel like my diaphragm area is very tight and not taking in as much air as it should even though the doctor said my O2 saturation was good and my breathing rate was also good. So Im pretty sure that my sleep is the main problem because ever since that happened 2 weeks ago it has been like a domino effect on my mental state. Im not really depressed as far as I know but I'm not sure because I don't THINK I've ever been truly depressed, I've been very, very upset and angry but nothing like this, my emotions are practically gone, I cant laugh, I dont feel sad or hopeless although the hope is going away after these 2 weeks, I just feel nothing, nothing other than the fact that I can't sleep irritates me, and I know Im very bothered by it because I catch myself pacing through my house often, though this has calmed down a little the past few days. My sex drive just randomly disappeared along with this (was very healthy sexually before this, literally the day before) and my cravings for food also vanished, I was also eating perfectly normal before this too. No food I see or smell wets my appetite or makes me hungry, so I bought a weight gainer powder just to keep my calories up and I dont starve.\n\nMy ability to yawn is gone too which is really strange, I can feel them coming on but my body will not let them come out or fully complete. Which also bothers me because Ive associated sleep with yawning. And Im sure this is because I notice it happening and my mind stops it. \n\nBut one of the strangest things in my opinion is I have had 3 or 4 moments which lasted a few hours over the past 2 weeks where it seemed like the entire problem went away randomly and was suddenly able to crave food and eat normally, laugh, relax, focus on tv shows and feel healthy sexually again, and even felt the need to take a natural nap, but once the day winded down and I started worrying about sleep again the emptiness comes back and erases the entire good feeling.\n\nIt's to the point where I lay in my bed and either I keep repeating a thought (song lyrics or some kind of sound bit from a tv show) over and over again in my head or I would feel like I wasnt actually in my bed and I was detached from my body or I wasnt me, almost as if I was dreaming without actually being asleep. There was also a moment where my mind wouldnt actually think of anything at all and it seemed like I was just staring at a black wall of no thoughts, this I kind of think was a result of the sleep deprivation. And when I finally fall asleep I will only sleep maybe 30 minutes to an hour, then Im back up again pacing back and forth worrying about sleep. The best way I can explain the way it feels when Im able to sleep is my subconscious will play a bunch of random images or thoughts and I can feel them right in front of my eyes, but now the thoughts are very few and feel like theyre coming from the top of my head (I realize this makes me sound worse lol), and my ears seem to be very active like I'm actually focusing on everything I hear while I'm trying to sleep. I normally have very vivid lucid dreams which I absolutely love to have, even nightmares, and wake up feeling so relaxed and refreshed the next day, but now they have also stopped. It feels like the more I actually think about the problem and trying to fix it is what makes it so much worse.\n\nMy physical ability hasnt been affected really by this, I can actually play video games and puzzle/word games better than I have ever been able to since this happened (extreme focus?) and I can still drive my car at essentially the same level as I could before granted I'm not running 36+ hours straight of being awake. Im still able to talk to people easily, actually a little bit more open since this happened though not as happy and jokey as I usually am.\n\nI do notice that my touch sensitivity has decreased, I can still feel things but nothing is really sharp feeling, I had my friend slap my back open handed just to test and I noticed that it didnt sting I just felt pressure of the slap and nothing else. But I'm hoping this is just another symptom of sleep deprivation.\n\nI feel like I also need to mention that I was on corticosteroids for months before this for my crohns and feel it could potentially be an adrenal gland issue? (Unlikely, but just throwing that out there)\n\nI went to the doctor for this and was prescribed ambien which has been helping me get progressively more sleep each night I take it except for last night it didn't do anything at all. because I felt like I was able to eat and chose to do that which I think ruined it since it was supposed to be taken on an empty stomach, but even when it does work I dont really like it because it doesnt feel like a natural sleep and Im also afraid of developing a habit.\n\nHas anyone ever been through something like this? Am I just  doing this to myself, worrying myself to death for absolutely no reason? If so, how do you go about this? Does it seem like something that would go away with some meditation or do you think I should pursue some more medical attention?\n\nPS. I would just like to say as someone who has never really had any instances like this, I could never quite understand how people who were going through these things truly felt. Now I know and have so much more empathy and sympathy for people so that's a positive thing that has come from it. And also it has made me personally realize that I would much rather feel emotional pain than be numb because I feel as if my soul is just ripped out of me, and I hate it so much.

She also has a couple of autoimmune conditions which often compound the depression and anxiety. \n\nAnyhow, she\'s on Concerta for ADHD which seems to be working well, however lately her anxiety has been somewhat intense and hard to manage. She gets certain medical treatments which cause physiological responses that mimic anxiety (shallow breathing, pressure in the chest, other nervous system responses, etc.) , and so it makes it really hard to tease apart what\'s what.\n\nHer newer doctor suggested that she start taking  Buspirone , but he told her she should take it ""as needed"", and that she would find a lot of information out there about how slow acting it is, and that it needs to be taken very regularly. He said don\'t worry about that, it can be used as needed and is being discovered to be effective that way. However we can\'t find any information whatsoever about taking this medication ""as needed"", and so were a little concerned. \n\nI understand they used to think it was some kind of selective dopamine agonist, but recently have discovered that it actually works more like an SSRI than they initially thought. \n\nIt was helping her anxiety tremendously, but she\'s getting a ton of uncomfortable physiological side effects - muscle aches, brain zaps, strange headaches, slight sense of discoordination, etc. So if she\'s taking it as needed but her levels are always going up and down, these side effects will probably be pretty regular vs. smoothing out over time, so we wanted to ask if anyone else has heard of this being effective or prescribed ""as needed""?\n\nAny information is much appreciated!'"

I (26F) want to help my 28M fiance get his health/cholesterol/exercise and diet routine under control. His cholesterol has skyrocketed since he started taking Seroquel a little over a year ago- his numbers are seriously awful. He\'s been on a variety of medications (currently lithium, seroquel, ambien and in the last year lipitor) since he was 15, and has been in therapy for just as long. I\'ve seen nearly the worst of his depressive episodes and helped him through a hospitalization and a series of ECT treatments. And, while he is not currently in a depressive episode, it feels like he\'s resigned to this inescapable fate. \n\nHe doesn\'t have the best diet, he doesn\'t exercise, he drinks too much and he loves his naps... and he doesn\'t believe that the potential benefits of life style change will offset the effect of the Seroquel. **Basically, because his numbers will still probably be higher than average even if he does everything else right, it\'s not worth it to adjust his lifestyle.** He\'s shown initiative with getting his health in order before, and I know he can do it again. The spark is there...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\'m asking yall for your opinions and what motivations work best for you, specifically as someone who also has bipolar or has bipolar family/friends. I don\'t want to nag him, that never works. I\'m trying to take my therapist\'s advice to form and maintain healthy boundaries with him. I am his partner, not his mother, and I can\'t *make* him get healthy. So, how do I show him that I love him and that I don\'t want ""to have and to hold for the rest of your lives"" to be a 10 year plan. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor reference, I have anxiety and mild depression and I also see a therapist once a week. We are going to start pre-marital counseling in a month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; how do I get my bipolar fiance to care more about his physical health, even though he\'s on a medication that\'s totally screwed with his metabolism?'"

Of course this makes me think the worse, (Stroke, MS etc. I have NO other symptoms of any of this stuff as I know these are just very irrational thoughts) as everything I read seems like it's stress/anxiety related. I have had the tight band around my head many times before and doctor said it's most likely anxiety/depression but the tingling is new. Or maybe it's seasonal allergies?

Before I started, I made a point to try to repair the moisture barrier of my *entire body*. I bought Aveeno moisturizing shower wash with a loofah on a stick (to reach my back) and put the cerave in a tub on my whole body after every shower for about two weeks prior. I really think this helped, because my body was not dry for almost my entire treatment! I kept this habit up the entire five months.\n\nWhen I started, my first side effect was dry scalp. It was SO itchy and flakey! My local pharmacist recommended that for the duration of my treatment, I should use a baby shampoo (he recommended Cerave) and a paraben-free conditioner. The baby shampoo was a godsend! Like all Cerave products, it has ceramides to help with hydration. Your scalp is skin just like the rest of your body, so it needs hydration too!\n\nThis took care of the scalp problem 100%. I was concerned about hair loss prior to accutane since I was ALREADY losing hair before starting, but I actually saw hair growth during my treatment! This is because the extreme oil that was always in my hair weighed it down and made it fall. Take that away, hydrate the skin properly, and my mini bald spots filled in!\n\nTiredness also hit me hard in the beginning and the only thing that really helped was drinking my bodyweight in water. But even with that, the exhaustion was hard to beat. I would say this was my second to most severe side effect.\n\nDry lips were not a huge side effect for me, surprisingly enough! Towards my final two months I looked a bit like the Joker with tears on both sides of my lips, but the lips themselves didn't really crack during the treatment. I put hyaluronic acid on my slightly damp lips, waited 2 minutes, then put LRP Cicaplast, topped by aquaphor to lock it all in.\n\nMy skin would only get dry and flake if I failed to do my skincare routine (which did occasionally happen out of the exhaustion mentioned above). But, if I did do it, my skin was smooth!\n\nRoutine:\n\nAM:- Wash face with water- Cerave hyaluronic acid serum- The Ordinary moisturizer- LRP Anthelios sunscreen SPF 60\n\nAfternoon:- Wash face with Cerave hydrating facial cleanser- The Ordinary hyaluronic acid- The Ordinary Niacimide (A note on this--my skin has always been the type to survive anything. I told myself I'd keep this in my routine to help with scarring but if ever it burned, I'd stop. It never did, so I used it the whole treatment!)- LRP Lipikar Balm AP\n\nEvening:- Wipe face with Avene extremely gentle cleanser lotion on cotton pad- Cerave PM skin renewing night cream\n\nI never suffered a nosebleed but I did suffer from leaky nostrils and a sweaty upper lip. To deal with the leaky nostrils, in the morning and at night I did a saline spray, followed by Nozoil (hydrating sesame oil spray) and then a product called Secaris applied with a q-tip.\n\nThe major side effect I had that was a literal pain was lower back pain. I have always had a terrible posture and knew I would hit this problem eventually, but Accutane really sped that process up. I would wake up EVERY morning with a lower back so sore that I couldn't stay in one position for more than 5 minutes. On bad nights, the back pain would wake me up and I would have to get out of bed to walk around and stretch.\n\nThis went away during the day unless I sat in a stupid position for a long time.\n\nWhat helped a lot was getting a side sleeper knee pillow on Amazon. It helps with the alignment of your spine as you sleep, so it took a lot of pressure off my back. It didn't cure the problem, but it helped. I also got a back belt that I wore during the day to help keep my core muscles engaged. On days where I worked my core either through exercise or with the belt, the overnight pain was drastically reduced.\n\nThere was awhile where I would put Voltaren Emulgel on my lower back before going to bed every night to prevent the pain, but I tried to stop doing that. Instead I keep advil on my nighstand and if I wake up with pain, I take 3.\n\nRegarding the purge: I thought I would escape it, silly me. It started about 2 months in for me and lasted until about the start of month 4, but I still got new pimples at the end of month 4. I talked to my derm about prolonging my treatment since I wasn't 100% clear, but I will have hit my cumulative dose and he's not comfortable continuing. Instead he made an appointment for me one month after I stop, to see what happens and to determine further treatment going forward. In the end, I would say I have been completely clear since week 1 of month 5 (and I am currently on week 2.5).\n\nI saw the viral TikTok about noses shrinking on Accutane and naturally compared my nose before and after. It shrunk a little. Out of curiosity, I asked my derm about it! He said that noses don't actually shrink, but that people who take Accutane tend to suffer from chronic inflammation of the face. Take away that inflammation and your features will look smaller! So if this has happened to you, welcome to your regular-sized nose. :)\n\nThat's about all that I can think of off the top of my head! I'd be glad to answer any questions if anyone has.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kojzlqtyw3271.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=948d8030f5a20c9645bd50396dec4c95fc282646\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/syipmztyw3271.jpg?width=2320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3aa277d264b964cb58b9dbfd5d29bc08da6b5361\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8xoroztyw3271.jpg?width=2320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5e5c7c0830db1a1c1b0f555c08ed878c98bbe507"""

I did take one last night - and it did knock me out a full 7 hours.  I woke up feeling grateful for that, but also still anxious and 'untrusting' of the rest I just got.  Mix in my tinnitus and - still anxiety.  However, if this medication helps me to sleep and function for my family/support them - then I guess this is what I have to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust curious if others have experiences like this and if they got through it?  I am reluctant to try another SSRI for fear of it worsening my Tinnitus.  Ironically, the medications I was on over the past 2-3 months were Lisinipril (apparently linked to tinnitus)  Metoprolol (linked to Tinnitus)  Xanax (linked to Tinnitus)  Prozac (linked to Tinnitus), Trazadone (rarely linked to tinnitus).

I live rural and the healthcare system sucks here basically. It took about 2.5 years before the Drs actually started booking me tests (ultrasounds, blood tests and MRIs)\n\nSo I had to wait one year to see a Vascular specialist.

Bedridden since May 23. \n\nAt first the Vascular specialist thought it was Nutcracker syndrome. I got an MRI and went back to see her. She said its not Nutcracker syndrome but might be Venous syndrome? I dont know what theyre called but the veins on the left side of my ovaries? Are all twisted up. She asked if any relatives of mine have varicose veins. I told her my mother and uncle have them really bad.\n\nI have to wait months for these appointments and was wondering if anyone might know whats wrong with me? The last few months Ive been getting excruciating slicing pains from my genitals to my abdomen. Its so painful to stand up or even walk around the house. Why have I been heavily bleeding for 4 years straight? I got a Mirena implanted but it came out a few weeks later. Now Im on the implanon contraceptive (6 months ago) and Im still bleeding. Another thing the vascular specialist said was that she couldnt locate the clip on my left side from when I got my tubes tied. Thankyou.'"

covid,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/s00wwh/remember_covid_causes_kidney_damage_so_get/,"b""Remember Covid causes kidney damage so get vaccinated and stay safe if you're on Lithium.""",,"b""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/health/covid-kidney-damage.html\n\n\n**Another Hidden Covid Risk: Lingering Kidney Problems**\n\n\nIn a study of veterans, Covid survivors were 35 percent more likely than other patients to have long-term kidney damage or declines in kidney function.\n\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, doctors have found that people who become very ill with Covid-19 often experience kidney problems, not just the lung impairments that are the hallmark of the illness.\n\n\nNow, a large study suggests that kidney issues can last for months after patients recover from the initial infection, and may lead to a serious lifelong reduction of kidney function in some patients.\n\n\nThe study, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, found that the sicker Covid patients were initially, the more likely they were to experience lingering kidney damage.\n\n\nBut even people with less severe initial infections could be vulnerable.\n\n\nYou see really, across the board, a higher risk of a bunch of important kidney-associated events, said Dr. F. Perry Wilson, a nephrologist and associate professor of medicine at Yale, who was not involved in the study. And what was particularly striking to me was that these persisted.\n\n\nKidneys play a vital role in the body, clearing toxins and excess fluid from the blood, helping maintain a healthy blood pressure, and keeping a balance of electrolytes and other important substances. When the kidneys are not working properly or efficiently, fluids build up, leading to swelling, high blood pressure, weakened bones and other problems.\n\n\nThe heart, lungs, central nervous system and immune system can become impaired. In end-stage kidney disease, dialysis or an organ transplant may become necessary. The condition can be fatal.\n\n\nThe new study, based on records of patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs health system, analyzed data from 89,216 people who tested positive for the coronavirus between March 1, 2020, and March 15, 2021, as well as data from 1,637,467 people who were not Covid patients.\n\n\n**Between one and six months after becoming infected, Covid survivors were about 35 percent more likely than non-Covid patients to have kidney damage or substantial declines in kidney function,** said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of the research and development service at the V.A. St. Louis Health Care System and senior author of the study.\n\n\nPeople who have survived the first 30 days of Covid are at risk of developing kidney disease,  said Dr. Al-Aly, a nephrologist and assistant professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine.\n\n\nBecause many people with reduced kidney function do not experience pain or other symptoms, whats really important is that people realize that the risk is there and that physicians caring for post-Covid patients really pay attention to kidney function and disease, he said.\n\n\nThe two sets of patients in the study differed, in that members of one group had all been infected with Covid and members of the other group may have had a variety of other health conditions. Experts cautioned that there were limitations to the comparisons.\n\n\nThe researchers tried to minimize the differences with detailed analyses that adjusted for a long list of demographic characteristics, pre-existing health conditions, medication usage and whether people were in nursing homes.\n\n\nAnother limitation is that patients in the V.A. study were largely male and white, with a median age of 68, so it is unclear how generalizable the results are.\n\n\nOne strength of the research, experts said, is that it involves over 1.7 million patients with detailed electronic medical records, making it the largest study so far on Covid-related kidney problems.\n\n\nWhile the results most likely would not apply to all Covid patients, they show that for those in the study, theres a pretty notable impact on kidney health in survivors of Covid-19 over the long term, particularly those who were very sick during their acute illness, said Dr. C. John Sperati, a nephrologist and associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins, who was not involved in the study.\n\n\nOther researchers have found similar patterns, so this is not the only study suggesting that these events are transpiring after Covid-19 infection, he added.\n\n\nHe and other experts said that if even a small percentage of the millions of Covid survivors in the United States developed lasting kidney problems, the impact on health care would be great.\n\n\nTo assess kidney function, the research team evaluated levels of creatinine, a waste product that kidneys are supposed to clear from the body, as well as a measure of how well the kidneys filter the blood called the estimated glomerular filtration rate.\n\n\nHealthy adults gradually lose kidney function over time, about 1 percent or less a year, starting in their 30s or 40s, Dr. Wilson said. Serious illnesses and infections can cause more profound or permanent loss of function that may lead to chronic kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease.\n\n\n**The new study found that 4,757 Covid survivors had lost at least 30 percent of kidney function in the year after their infection, Dr. Al-Aly said.**\n\n\nThat is equivalent to roughly 30 years of kidney function decline, Dr. Wilson said.\n\n\nCovid patients were 25 percent more likely to reach that level of decline than people who had not had the illness, the study found.\n\n\nSmaller numbers of Covid survivors had steeper declines. But Covid patients were 44 percent more likely than non-Covid patients to lose at least 40 percent of kidney function and 62 percent more likely to lose at least 50 percent.\n\n\nEnd-stage kidney disease, which occurs when at least 85 percent of kidney function is lost, was detected in 220 Covid patients, Dr. Al-Aly said. Covid survivors were nearly three times as likely to receive the diagnosis as patients without Covid, the study found.\n\n\nDr. Al-Aly and his colleagues also looked at a type of sudden renal failure called acute kidney injury, which other studies have found in up to half of hospitalized Covid patients. The condition can heal without causing long-term loss of kidney function.\n\n*More info at the NYTimes. I'm on my phone and it's hard to copy paste. Stay safe everyone.*"""

At the hospital they did ECG, blood test and even xray of my chest and all turned out to be normal just that I have an elevated TSH level which I was told not to worry about, I was discharged the same day.

I was shocked, and then it happened again, suddenly my upper body feels really hot and my heart started beating really hard and fast (150BPM I have a oximeter at that time) the palpitations felt worst this time and I actually thought I was about to have a cardiac arrest so I rang 995.

So that means that if you get in a car accident and you become traumatized physically, and the pain is too big for your system to integrate, then you will probably have memory loss after that car accident.\n\nOr if something else happens to you physically that is just so painful that it\'s too much, then you won\'t remember it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in the same way when something happens to you that is emotionally too painful, you remember it, and that\'s actually a good thing because if you get, god forbid, raped or abused in some way in your childhood, for example, by a family member or whatever it may be, maybe it\'s not like a physical direct abuse, but it\'s more like lack of attention, chronically lack of love, chronically, anything like that could accumulate into something that is too painful for a child to actually realize.\n\nAnd why is that? Well, you know, if a child doesn\'t get attention for one day, it\'s not that bad.\n\nBut if he doesn\'t, if he doesn\'t get attention all the time, then at some point he\'s gonna have to realize I\'m never gonna get the attention that I need in order to develop myself in order to grow up.\n\nAnd basically what that means is my parents just don\'t love me enough and they will never be there for me in the way that I need.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that realization is incredibly emotionally painful, and that\'s something that the child will never be consciously aware of.\n\nBoth the emotional pain that is too devastating to be able to cope with.\n\nAnd physical pain that is too devastating to be able to cope with causes memory loss.\n\nWhat that actually means is that even though you do remember it at some level your system remembers, your consciousness doesn\'t remember.\n\nSo at the level that you were thinking, you don\'t, you, you can\'t recall it consciously, basically you don\'t know that it happened to you or you don\'t know what it was like, or you know, the event, but not what it felt like.\n\nAnd they remember some things that happened to them that probably weren\'t so nice, but they think, well, it\'s fine.\n\nI don\'t really remember any pain from that.\n\nYeah, that\'s because the outward effect is memory loss.\n\nBut what it actually means is the memory is still there, but it\'s been shut off.\n\nIt\'s been gated.\n\nAnd so this has been done by the repressive system.\n\nSo I want to introduce the concept of the repression system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the system in your body is comprised of several functions, but what it is responsible for is to shield your consciousness, your active awareness from pain that is too hard to deal with and would actually be dangerous to deal with.\n\nSo this could be physical pain or emotional pain.\n\nAnd it\'s actually good because too much pain is dangerous.\n\nLike it can actually, too much pain can cause you, your psyche to disintegrate.\n\nIt can cause you to to go crazy or it can actually cause death.\n\nSo this is not a joke.\n\nIt\'s not like you shouldn\'t have had this impact of this, this particular pain being blocked out.\n\nNow you should have had it blocked out because if you hadn\'t had it blocked out, you could have died.\n\nIt could have been really dangerous.\n\nSo it\'s there for a reason, but what this is, it means is now it becomes a trauma.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA trauma is when pain was too big to feel, and then it gets blocked.\n\nAnd very simply put, that\'s what a trauma is.\n\nAnd when it gets blocked, it means that it\'s still there, but you can\'t access it, therefore it is stuck.\n\nSo when a tr when a pain is stuck, it\'s still bothering you, it\'s still causing mayhem in the body and in the psyche, but you\'re not aware of it.\n\nThere\'s gates in the brain that are able to block different levels of consciousness from each other.\n\nAnd I\'ll quickly draw for you how that works.\n\nSo I\'ve talked about the different levels of the human psyche before, very simply, it\'s thinking, feeling, sensing and thinking is, is pretty con is pretty obvious.\n\nIt\'s, it\'s your conscious and awareness and what you think and what you believe and what basically everything that goes on your stories that you have in your head and the voice that you have in your head.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that is called the third line, or that\'s basically the thinking level.\n\nThen below that, there\'s the feeling level.\n\nAnd by feeling, I mean emotional feeling.\n\nSo here, here\'s where all the anger and the sadness and the joy and the love and the feelings, the emotional feelings live deeper than that though is the reptile brain.\n\nReptiles famously don\'t have emotions, but they can feel, they can feel physical things.\n\nThey can sense all the sensations that come with having a body internal digestive tract, lungs, heart, et cetera.\n\nAnd also external, just like maintaining.\n\nIt\'s maintaining the status of everything that happens inside the body, inside the physical.\n\nAnd therefore it can have states such as terror and fight or flight.\n\nBut this is as deep as it goes.\n\nAnd this level also develops a lot earlier than the feeling system develops.\n\nThe feeling system only starts to mature as a child is five to six months old.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat\'s when it starts to develop simple emotions.\n\nBefore that it\'s only pain or no pain in deadly trouble, or not inly trouble fight or flights terror or we\'re good.\n\nIt\'s, it\'s very, very simplistic.\n\nAnd that\'s what what the reptile brain is responsible for.\n\nAnd that is the sensing system.\n\nSo basically we have three levels.\n\nIt\'s thinking, feeling, and sensing.\n\nSo what happens when a catastrophic impact is made on one of these levels that the other levels probably couldn\'t deal with? That\'s when they get are activated.\n\nSo if you have a car accident or someone tortures you or something really bad happens that causes a lot of physical pain, you\'re sensing system might take the impact, take a lot of pain, and this would immediately activate the gates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here I\'ve illustrated that you would basically have an enormous pain at the sensing level, but when your system, your body recognizes this pain is going to be too big, this is a huge problem, we might self-destruct.\n\nIf we let this into our full awareness, then the gates will be activated.\n\nSo basically the pain from the sensing level is trying to come up to be experienced.\n\nAnd if you would be able to experience it safely, then you would move through it and there would not be a trauma created.\n\nBut because it\'s too much, your system detects we cannot move through this and we need to block this.\n\nAnd then the gates activate.\n\nSo the gates are basically neurons that are constantly sending inhibitory signals and block the communication between these levels.\n\nSo this is basically blocked.\n\nThis means that your emotional system doesn\'t know what actually the big sensory pain was or has been.\n\nThis, it starts when this pain is inflicted, but then it continues.\n\nAnd then your, your system is always working, constantly sending these like sh sh sh sh sh, sh, sh, sh, sh shushing signals.\n\nBasically.\n\nIt\'s exhausting to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd, and that\'s basically how you live your life from there on onwards until you basically do something like EMDR or another kind of therapy that deals with the trauma like primal therapy or regression therapy or, or emdr, anything that would basically address this level and, and dig out this pain dig out this experience.\n\nUntil you do that, you\'re blissfully unaware that there has ever been this level of pain.\n\nAnd you\'re always, these neurons are always firing these, these shh signals.\n\nShut up, shut up, shut up.\n\nWe don\'t wanna know.\n\nSo your, your emotions are not aware and also your thinking is not aware of how painful that was.\n\nNow, when something happens that is emotionally very painful, same thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo basically say your parents divorce or something like that, and you\'re like five years old, you don\'t know how to deal with it.\n\nYou feel completely, you feel very unsafe.\n\nLike no one\'s going to take care of you and, and you\'re basically on your own.\n\nAnd this is too much to deal with.\n\nThis is as, as this is happening, this is going to mess with your thinking too much.\n\nYou will basically go nuts or or die.\n\nSo that means that the gates are activated and also here on this level the disconnection is then made between the thinking level and the feeling level, which means that this giant ball of pain of like, I\'m unsafe.\n\nMy parents can\'t even take care of themselves or make a harmonious home for me because they\'re constantly fighting with each other and splitting up.\n\nI\'m all alone, blah, blah, blah.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt\'s too painful.\n\nThe gates are activated.\n\nThey\'re constantly shushing this pain and creating a, a disconnect between the thinking level and the feeling level.\n\nAnd this is how you get people that can say that they\'re fine and believe that they\'re fine.\n\nAnd emotionally they\'re absolutely not fine.\n\nThey have a lot of tension in their body, for example.\n\nAnd they might, might be very jumpy and overreact to a lot of things and get easily triggered and, but they think that they\'re fine and they don\'t really know what they\'re feeling.\n\nSo they think they\'re fine, but the reason that they don\'t know what they\'re feeling is because the gates are active.\n\nOkay? So that\'s one part of the repression system.\n\nWhy am I telling you this? Because this takes a lot of energy.\n\nThis takes a lot of energy.\n\nSo one drawback basically is that it\'s just a stress on your body to constantly have these gates activated.\n\nYou have to see this as like a huge electrical charge trying to discharge.\n\nAnd then to counteract that, the body has to, the brain has to constantly fire signals at, at that.\n\nSo it, it\'s costing you a lot of electrical energy literally to suppress that pain.\n\nBut that\'s not all that the regression system does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo it has gates, but it also has endorphins.\n\nIt also has endorphins.\n\nSo endorphins are your internal painkillers.\n\nThey\'re much stronger than you could actually externally take.\n\nSo your endorphins that your body is able to produce, and these are the feel good, feel good chemicals that you also feel when you might go for a run for like an hour.\n\nOr you might go for a walk for like two, two or three hours.\n\nYou feel this great endorphin rush.\n\nAnd this is the substance that your body produces, that interacts with the op receptors.\n\nDoes the same thing with heroin, morphine other op opiate drugs who do, it\'s a very potent internally produced painkiller.\n\nSo it\'s a very potent internally produced painkiller.\n\nGreat.\n\nAnd it\'s fine to enjoy that after you\'ve had a run or you\'ve had a walk or you\'ve had some sort of exercise that also helps to feel not completely broken after exercise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what\'s wrong with that? There\'s gating.\n\nSo I don\'t know that I\'ve been hurt and I don\'t know that that pain is still there.\n\nGreat, yeah, it costs a bit of energy, but you know, I, I\'ve got energy, who cares? You might say, well actually gates is not enough.\n\nBecause if you just had the gating, then you\'re not aware that you\'ve been hurt, you\'re not aware that you have a physical or an emotional trauma, but your body still very much is in pain even though you don\'t know what\'s going on.\n\nAnd therefore you also need the endorphins.\n\nYou also need the painkillers to be elevated constantly.\n\nThese endorphin levels are chronically elevated, which would be great, and it allows you to go through life\'s thinking.\n\nNo, nothing bad happened to you and you\'re fine.\n\nHowever, endorphins are proven to mess with the immune system.\n\nThat is a problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo endorphins, the impair the production of different cells that immune system uses to break breakdown malignant cells, detect diseases and and whatnot.\n\nIt impairs the production of certain immune system cells and it also messes with their function.\n\nIt confuses the immune system.\n\nLiterally the immune system is very complex and every day it\'s fighting cancer cells, cleaning up dirt, it\'s cleaning up old cells and it\'s cleaning up garbage that from your digestive system.\n\nAnd it\'s cleaning up cancer cells that you are basically producing every day.\n\nAnd if it stops cleaning up cancer cells, you get cancer.\n\nAnd if it gets confused about what things to fight, it might fight parts of your own body.\n\nAnd that\'s how you get autoimmune disorders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to recap, if you\'ve got trauma, be it physical or emotional, that means at some point the pain level was so high that you couldn\'t deal with it and you had to block it out.\n\nAnd that pain is still with you.\n\nThat pain, you\'re still carrying that pain, blissfully unaware that it is ever was ever there.\n\nThen your body\'s working all the time to keep you blissfully unaware that it was ever there.\n\nAnd part of that work means raising the levels of endorphin in the blood so that your level of feel-good chemicals has to be higher than a more mental healthy person to feel normal.\n\nAnd with that chronically elevated endorphin level, the immune system is suppressed.\n\nAnd over time, after years and years, it starts working less and less well, it starts getting more and more confused.\n\nEventually some cancer cells get undetected or eventually the immune system starts getting confused about what\'s mine and not mine and it starts fighting itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis has also been very well described in the book ""When the body says no"", that\'s basically why you get sick eventually after you suffer trauma.\n\nSo yes, it is actually dangerous to not deal with your trauma.\n\nSo whether it\'s trauma that you incurred in a singular event or trauma that you basically have from childhood, from lacking certain types of care and love and attention from parents, you probably, if that\'s the case, you\'re probably not even aware of it or maybe you have some sort of vague memories that seem like if you think about them, yeah, maybe a child wouldn\'t have liked that so much.\n\nBut I don\'t remember it being very painful and I don\'t understand why I\'m having such neurotic thoughts or habits or weird ticks all the time or whatever it may be, or why I\'m depressed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe it a car accident, a war or an imperfect childhood that you don\'t remember parts from.\n\nIf you don\'t deal with it, you risk your chance of getting cancer or auto autoimmune disorders and this is why.\n\nSo I hope that inspired you to take another look at your childhood and if there\'s hints of things that you don\'t remember so well, or if you have other reasons to be, believe that you were neurotic and you might have some childhood trauma, deal with it because it also massively impact your physical health.\n\nSo thank you for reading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Death By Childhood - How Trauma Slowly Kills](https://youtu.be/8Xr0cOCgGeY)'"

I've recently acquired dental insurance so I'm working on trying to fix both of those issues. I've only had the first visit with my dentist , they've taken x-rays and done a physical examination. I've been diagnosed with periodontal disease, though the dentist has said that the bone loss is fairly minor. Unfortunately I haven't gotten a copy of my xrays to post. The teeth themselves seem to be in surprisingly good shape considering the circumstances, only needing a couple small cavities filled.\n\nMy treatment plan consists of a planing/scaling, then filling the cavities that need to be filled. During the first visit, after the x-rays and exams, they said they could actually get the first half of the scaling done immediately and they would schedule a second appointment to get the other half done. I have a few questions regarding this though.\n\n1.) The hygienist that worked on the planing/scaling used what she said was basically a high powered water pick. I've tried to look up information about planing/scaling this way, but I haven't been able to find what equipment would have been used. Is this even a valid procedure? It's possible it was simply an ultrasonic scaler, but I don't remember hearing or feeling any scraping other than the couple of times she used a manual scraper to get some particularly stuck tartar off.\n\n2.) About 12-13 years ago, I had a root canal on tooth 9, and crowns on 8&9 due to abscesses and decay. The dentist used a PFM crowns, with the two fused together. My current dentist wants to replace these because he says the metal seems to be irritating my gums, plus the fact that I can't floss between them as easily due to the fusing. The gum above these two teeth do seem to be more inflamed than the rest of my gums. (Since I've started flossing, the redness has pretty much completely gone away except for teeth 8-11, and has been reduced even on those.) Would replacing these really be worth the trouble/cost of having them removed and new crowns made considering that they're still in good condition?\n\n3.) Not particularly related to my treatment plan, but a factor in my appointments, I'm currently on blood thinners (warfarin/aspirin) due to a hypercoaguable state . During the initial planing/scaling mentioned earlier, there was a considerable amount of bleeding despite my INR being in the therapeutic range. I've had to reschedule my second planing/scaling appointment due to my blood getting too thin from antibiotics I've been taking for a sinus infection. For dentists who have experience treating patients on blood thinners, how much bleeding is to be expected? It looked about like a horror movie after my first appointment, and the hygienist had to constantly soak up blood with gauze and rinse and wipe it away.\n\nThanks to those who took the time to read all that, and doubly so for those who respond.

A couple of days later, I noticed a rashy patch on my outer left lower leg.\n\nI've been (infrequently) putting a hydrocortisone cream on it, and haven't been thinking much about it because the location is hard to see. (My body doesn't bend that way and I'm not very flexible.)\n\nToday, however, I happened to take a look at it at now there is a hard red bump with a white head there. I thought perhaps it was a cyst or boil or aggressive acne, and tried squeezing it, but that did nothing except make the skin in the vicinity unhappy and it was clear that it was not something that could be popped. It is harder than the surrounding skin, but like you might expect a firm pimple to be, and again, it does have a white head on it.\n\nOther facts to note about me:\n\n1. I take a large number of medications for hypertension (bisoprolol, amlodipine, clonidine), Crohn's (prednisone for six months, just started back on Stelara two weeks ago, kratom for pain relief), and generalized anxiety / insomnia (alprazolam, Ambien, melatonin, diphenhydramine). Low B12 / D that is now being treated by my gastroenterologist with injections and supplements.\n2. I do drink (approximately four to six beers in the evening every day).\n3. I have had kidney issues in the past, and have some mild fatty liver, probably from ricocheting back and forth in weight due to Crohn's.\n\nI don't think there were any medication changes around the time I first noticed this.\n\nAs mentioned, it's been about 10 weeks or so since I first noticed this. I tend to have bad skin in general with a tendency to get cystic acne and abscesses, so at first I didn't think much of it, but it is definitely not like any cystic acne or abscess (both of which I have had recently, i.e. in the last four weeks - the abscess resolved on its own and was nowhere near the site of this rash).\n\nNo pain or itching (well, mild pain when I push on the bump), which is another reason why I don't think about it much.

Tetracycline,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/aocrw4/my_accutane_experience_13_months_post_accutane/,b'My Accutane Experience - 13 Months Post Accutane',,"b""(if this is against community rules please feel free to take it down - I just thought this could be helpful!) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was on Accutane from June 2017 - December 2017, and thought I would share my experience here, and hopefully answer any questions about what it's like before, during, and after. I've broken it up into little categories in case you're only looking for specific information. \n\nMY SKIN HISTORY: \n\nI've had acne since I was about 11 - it was never really that bad, just something that ran in my family, and didn't really think much about. Right before I started high school, it started to get more severe, and I started going to my derm. I was on a couple of different topical prescriptions throughout most of high school, including Differin, Epiduo,  Clindamycin, Dapsone, as well as taking Doxycycline for a while. I still got acne, but it wasn't as bad as it could be, and I just tried to ignore it. \n\nAt the end of my senior year of high school, my acne started to get really bad in a way it hadn't before - I had cystic acne all over my face and even on my jaw, which had never happened before. My derm put me on Tetracycline, but it gave me these weird nose-bleeds that I could feel in my brain, so I just stopped taking it. So I asked her about Accutane, and after the normal pre-accutane shit (blood tests, peeing in a cup, more blood tests, etc) I started taking it. \n\nI think I was on 30mg the first month, then 60mg for a while, and then finally somewhere around 80mg, but I don't really remember. \n\nSIDE EFFECTS: \n\n**I'm going to preface this with: if you feel like accutane is affecting your mental and physical health in any way that does not seem normal, please talk to your doctor and try to figure something else out. I was an idiot who chose vanity over my own health, and I'm still dealing with the consequences.** \n\n\\[PHYSICAL\\] I've always had horrendously dry skin, so accutane didn't actually dry my skin out much more than it already was. My lips got ridiculously dry and cracked, I experienced that weird nose-bleed-but-not things where you just have bloody scabs in your nose the whole time -  I only got an actual nose-bleed once, near the end. My ability to heal took a nose-dive (seriously, I cut the back of my heel on a door about three months in, and it still hasn't completely healed. It's just this weird, slightly raised, purple scar now.)  I was basically in constant, low level bodily pain and always fatigued. I had dry eye, and my vision would constantly blur in bright light and/or darkness to the point where I was effectively momentarily blind in certain environments, and I still can't see as well as I used to when I am facing direct sunlight. I was also short of breath after short walks that would never had made me winded before. I experienced mild hair thinning, as well as my hair being dryer than normal, but that fixed itself after I finished. I completely lost my appetite, and lost probably about 10 or 15 pounds, which I normally wouldn't have considered a negative, but I looked more like a slowly decaying corpse, rather than like I'd started going to the gym more often. \n\n\\[MENTAL\\] I've struggled with depression on and off since I was about fourteen, but figured accutane wouldn't really make that much of a difference. It did. I became more severely depressed than I have ever been, basically living in a fog. I honestly can't remember much of my time on accutane because I was just completely checked out. It upped my suicidal ideation up by about 1000 notches, and I still struggle with suicidal thoughts. I also developed anxiety, which I had never had an issue with before, and it has not gone away. I was also just a major, wildly moody bitch all the time, because of all of the above. \n\nHOW I COPED:\n\nWater is your best friend. Water should always be your friend, but while on accutane, you should be married to it. Get a liter water bottle and drink from it constantly. I think by the end of Accutane I was drinking about 4 liters of water throughout the day. \n\nDevelop a skin-care routine that isn't harsh, but takes care of your skin. Moisturize moisturize moisturize - day and night, and make sure your day-time moisturizer has an SPF. Cetaphil (ironically) breaks me out, so I use Eucerin face wash and moisturizers, an astringent, and tea tree oil to take care of the acne that does occasionally form now.   (Tea tree oil is pretty drying, though, and while I was on accutane I would only use it every couple of days.) \n\nLip balm and aquaphor. Religiously. \n\nSleep regularly and often. The fatigue is terrible, if you get it, and hits at the most random times - don't skimp on sleep, it helps. \n\nEat. As much as you can. Your body is going through hell, and even if you haven't felt hunger in 3 months, you still need to put food in your body so it can keep you going. \n\nIf you usually wear makeup - don't. I know it sucks walking around with a bare face when you have acne, but I think that really helped the accutane do it's job faster, since I wasn't clogging my pores with chemicals. Plus, when your skin gets that dry, it's hard to make anything look good. \n\nRESULTS:\n\nI don't have pictures to post since I never photographed myself when I had bad acne, and I don't even photograph myself all that much these days, but my skin is clear and smooth. (Not-so) amusingly, the literal day after I stopped taking accutane, I woke up with two angry looking white-heads, one on each side of my face, right next to my nose. I Freaked Out, but they went away in about two days. \n\nI had no active acne by the end of the third month, and I was lucky enough that I a) didn't have pitted acne scars, and b) the remaining months took care of most of the scarring and hyper-pigmentation that I did have. \n\nI only break out now if I'm doing something that would have broken me out before accutane - wearing makeup that irritates me, eating too much dairy (I'm actually semi-convinced that accutane made dairy break me out more than it did before, but I have no actual proof of that), or other random things, like nicotine withdrawal. The breakouts that I do get can barely be classified as such, in comparison to what my skin was like pre-accutane. They rarely come to a head, go away after a few days, and don't leave dark red marks that take months to fade. \n\nWOULD I DO IT AGAIN:\n\nNo, never in my life. However, as you can probably tell, I had a really shit run of it, and I probably shouldn't have continued taking it, but my blood tests were always fine, so I figured it probably wasn't going to kill me or anything. It worked, that is for sure. Everybody has different reactions, and as I said above, please talk to your doctor if something doesn't feel right - having severe acne sucks in a lot of ways, but there are other ways to manage it, and your well being is the most important thing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: Accutane sucks, but it's (mostly) worth it.** """

They are appearing mostly on my extremities (hands, arms, legs, feet), but Ive gotten a handful on my face, neck, and back. Every day a few new ones will pop up, usually in pairs or sets of three or four. My fianc, who I live with, has experienced some similar bumps, but not nearly to the same degree - just a few here and there, and then they will dissipate in a day or two. This is what makes me think that this is something environmental or contagious, as opposed to just a ""me problem.""\n\nI have explored so many possibilities and seen a doctor twice. I got referred to a dermatologist, but cant get an appointment for a while, so I thought Id crowdsource to see what you all think in the meantime.

Thanks in advance for any input!\n\nThese are the things that I think Ive ruled out: \n\n* Bed bugs, fleas, mites (Ive deep cleaned my entire apartment and applied bug and mite-killing stuff onto my couch, mattress, rugs, and chairs. I checked my (indoor) cat for any bumps or bugs, and shes fine too. I also ordered an air purifier to filter out dust/dander.)\n* Reaction to detergent/soap (I havent used any new products in the past few months that would cause this. I also purposely avoid products with fragrances and harsh chemicals to begin with.)\n* Lyme disease - I had some blood tests ordered by the doctor, and Lyme disease was ruled out\n* HIV and syphilis  - the doctor tested for these too, and Im negative\n* Monkeypox - my doctor asserted that this is not any sort of pox\n\nOther factors:\n\n* When looking at the blood test results that my doctor ordered, they found out I may have some type of rheumatic/autoimmune dysfunction. (Positive rheumatoid factor and abnormal ANA 1:640) I am scheduled to see a rheumatologist about that soon.\n* I have been taking Lamotrigine which can cause Steven-Johnson syndrome. But I have been taking it for 3+ years with no issue so far.\n* I am not having any other symptoms like fever, nausea, chills, etc. that would normally be associated with an infection or virus. \n* I was prescribed an antihistamine (Hydroxyzine) and have been taking it as directed, but its not making a difference. \n* I have been using ALL the creams. The only one that seems to make a slight difference is Benadryl extra strength (Diphenhydramine hydrochloride 2%). Ive also been using cold compress to numb the itchiness, which definitely works, but doesnt do much to actually make the bumps go away. \n* There has been a heat wave where I live, and the one day that all this seemed to ease up a little was the day it was 75 degrees (versus 80-90+ like it has been). We have air conditioning and fans, but our apartment doesnt have great airflow. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xlkm39n7u4f91.jpg?width=1149&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=35be3fbae379f80326c85806a670864dbdb62737\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ml0azkh6u4f91.jpg?width=1149&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7e1229911c1e578f558bfd66cf1411de172a040b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x90y1u05u4f91.jpg?width=1149&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=915a8b19e978eb301054d7e9ae941f0185bf109a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1uvfn9bu4f91.jpg?width=2039&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fe3b4c780cc16f959fbe81401414b6f9191d7bbd'"

They just don\'t work on me anymore.\n\nNow, I have a gap + a huge cavity in my upper rights (don\'t know tooth numbers), after every mean, I can floss out pieces of food the size of peas or corn kernels. There is gum recession and at my last dentist visit, some evidence of bone loss. This was a few years ago. They tried to do xrays, but could not, so they settled on a pano, but I guess it didn\'t give them enough detailed info to do a procedure, but even if it had, I require sedation.\n\nSo I switched clinics, to a local sedation dentistry outfit that came highly recommended/rated. That\'s when I learned that my insurance would not cover the sedation part, and it was like $1,600. So I had to postpone ""establishing"" myself with them until my next medical Flex spending annual cycle. \n\nThat didn\'t happen - life got in the way - wife and kids, injuries, illnesses, job changes, multiple deaths in the family. The tooth got worse, occasionally there would be pain for a few days or a week, I would aggressively treat it - brushing 4x a day, rinsing 2-3x a day, using listerine, using chlorhexidine, putting a bead of Anbesol on some dental floss and flossing with it to make the pain go away -- eventually, the pain would go away for a few months. This continued on and off for 4 years. My breath is unimaginably bad - brushing does little to ameliorate it.\n\nNote: Here\'s something I noticed. Once during this period, a coupla years back, I had a bacterial illness of some kind, something in my lungs. They prescribed me Cipro (I think). by day 2-3 of the Cipro, it was like my gums had magically been cured - no stink, no bad odor, and essentially no symptoms. Don\'t know if that\'s relevant info or not.\n\nAnyway... This past week, the pain has been borderline excruciating -eating hurts, drinking hurts, soda REALLY hurts. I\'m about to sign a contract for a new job that will raise my salary $15-20K, so I figured the $1,600 sedation bill will finally be do-able, so I went to get checked out and the Sedation Dentistry place i had tried to see years before.\n\nI spent 45-50 minutes in the chair trying to get xrays done. Couldn\'t do it. The ""Rinn"" system thing and the bite apparatus/wand was WAY too big for my mouth, I couldn\'t seem to control the movement of my tongue, I kept gagging, violently. Nothing worked - breathing through my nose, saline sprays, nasal cones, using a pediatric sized attachment, nothing. (I can\'t do the numbing spray - I have swallowing issues as well, and the numbing makes that really bad.) The hygienist was SO patient with me... literally over a period of almost an hour, trying over and over again to get it to work. I had to leave with no xrays, and no diagnosis.\n\nThey did take a pano. But they said I needed a full set of xrays. \n\nI\'ve been calling around locally to see if ANYONE still uses old school bitewings and film, but no dice. I don\'t know what to do. i can\'t pay an extra $1,600 just to be sedated JUST for the xrays. And my need is becoming emergent. Bone loss has almost certainly worsened, the pain is affecting my daily life, at a minimum I need a root canal, but more likely an extraction, a screw and an implant. But the clinic won\'t do anything without detailed xrays of the region.\n\nMaybe, given the situation, Delta would consider the sedation ""medically necessary"" and approve coverage for it? I\'m lost - stressed out, and in a lot of pain. Don\'t know what to do - practically in tears right now.'"

We didn\'t know what caused them and he was put on warfarin (was told that he would likely be on it for life). Fast forward to July of this year and we take him back to the hospital due to trouble breathing. Turns out he did have another PE (which we suspected already just due to his symptoms). They check his INR and it is at a 1.1. We are stunned by this, as he had been taking his meds like he was told (he took 15mg of warfarin every day except weekends. Everyone we talked to thought this was a crazy high dosage, but this is the dosage they came up with in the hospital the first time, because anything less than that did not get him into therapeutic range). The doctor this time recommended moving him to a different blood thinner (I think it was Xarelto, but I could be mistaken). This blood thinner was mentioned the first time but they didn\'t put him on it because they said at the time it did not have a lot of studies with obese patients. But the doc said now there were more studies on it that found it to be safe. And he said that warfarin is a terrible blood thinner. They did surgery to remove this clot, because it was very big and too dangerous to try just a heparin drip alone. They thought they got all the clots out, but I guess they didn\'t. A few days later, they wanted him to walk around before he was discharged. When he stood up, he passed out and his heart stopped. They did cpr and gave him several bolus doses of heparin (I believe that\'s what was in the bolus. Sorry, the exact facts of when he was dying are fuzzy to me). Ultimately, they weren\'t able to save him. They said what likely happened is that he still had a clot somewhere that dislodged when he stood up and went to his heart, stopping it. Where I\'m at a loss is this: how is it possible that his INR was so low when he was taking his meds as he was supposed to? I know for a fact he was taking them because I was the one that gave them to him every night. And I made sure he took them. Can you become warfarin resistant? Is what the doctor said about warfarin true? That it is a terrible blood thinner?'"

The dentist was stumped, and referred me to an oral surgeon to see if they could figure out the problem. \n\nThe oral surgeon can't see me until Monday, and I had bad enough pain this morning that I took two Advil and applied a lot of oragel, and I took to the internet to see if I could figure out what it was on my own. I'm not usually the type to self-diagnose, I know to trust medical professionals but man I was desperate, in a lot of pain. \n\nLong story short, my symptoms seemed to point to a partially erupted transverse lingual paramolar. It just made sense: I have bumps in a pattern that seems similar to the crown of a small molar, it feels like teething pain, I poked one of the bumps with very pointy tweezers and it felt like poking a tooth, and my teeth on the left side seem to have shifted forward in my mouth a bit, as my left canine is more crooked than the right, and it used to not be crooked. \n\nI know paramolars are rare, but I have a buccal conical paramolar on tooth # 15 (I think, I might have the wrong number. Very back top left molar). So with pain around and behind tooth # 18 (very back, bottom left), I wondered if it was just a vertical symmetry thing, I have a spare tooth on the top left so maybe I'd grow one on the bottom left too. According to a study I found on the management of supernumerary teeth, it is rare but possible to have a supplemental paramolar between the first and second maxillary molars. I had my wisdom teeth, my first maxillary molars, removed, so a paramolar behind my farthest back tooth would be between the second maxillary molar and the space where the first maxillary molar would have been, had it not been extracted. \n\nSo I went back to the dentist and requested a copy of my x-rays. The close-ups didn't go back that far, but the panoramic didn't show anything in the area where I'm having pain. I told the dentist my theory, so they agreed to take another xray as far back in my mouth as possible, just to see if there was anything there that didn't show on the panoramic for some reason. \n\nThat close up doesn't show anything behind my # 18 molar. So now I'm stumped, the dentist is stumped, and I have to wait all weekend before I can go to the oral surgeon to see if they have any idea what it could be. \n\nWhat could be hard like a tooth, feels like teething and pressure on my other teeth, but not show up on x-rays? \n\nI'm attaching a picture of my paramolar on the top tooth in case that matters, as well as pictures of the bumps in question (as good as I could get by shoving my iPhone in my mouth, sorry it's not ideal) and the x-rays. \n\nAt this point I'm probably stuck just using oragel all weekend and waiting to meet with the surgeon anyway, but I figured I'd ask Reddit just in case anybody could identify the problem, so I could at least bring a theory to the surgeon now that my paramolar theory was shot down. \n\nIf you read all this, thank you for your time. And whether you read all of it or not, I hope you have a good day!"""

It\'s driving me crazy to lie down because it feels like my bed is moving. \n\nSome background: had a partial mastectomy in December for what turned out to be a benign growth, in the operating room I had an extremely severe bleed which required me to be hospitalized until they could control the bleeding. Got a pedicure a week later and the lady nicked me, was also bleeding like an insane amount from that tiny cut for 30+ minutes.  Followed up with primary care, all my blood clotting factors were normal but ferritin was 9. B12 is 850. I had been taking iron supplements (28mg w/ vitamin c and folate) for a year prior. We upped my dose. Just had ferritin re-checked last week, was 16. \n\n\nIn late January, I had an intestinal blockage with impacted stool and went to ER for severe abdominal pain. CBC was good, metabolic panel was good. They did a CT with contrast which sent me into anaphylactic shock, gave me epinephrine and IV Benadryl..The fatigue started 4 days after this. It came on very suddenly along with sharp (UTI-like) pain. Again went into the ER because I thought I was dying with how bad the fatigue/disorientation was. My vitals, labs, and chest x-ray were normal. My EKG was normal. So they discharged me and said it could be autoimmune or something. \n\n\nMy school clinic checked my thyroid (normal) and celiac (normal). Unfortunately I\'ve also just lost health insurance.

I have no idea what to do. \n\nI do have a carbon monoxide detector and even bought a new one which shows the PPM to make sure.\n\nOther symptoms: some numbness and tingling in toes/fingers, right arm periodically feels very weak (could be a pinched nerve idk). Long-range vision is getting worse especially at night. Sleeping 10+ hours and waking up feeling disoriented and even more exhausted.

November 22 I developed an itchy rash on the back of my neck which soon spread to my shoulders, back and eventually my face/ears/scalp. I work in TRAUMA/ER and the only thing I could think of was a recent exposure to a homeless woman that we believed to have scabies and some sort of visible lice or bugs all over her. Unfortunately, she did not survive so follow up at the onset of my symptoms was not available. I was treated for scabies with permethrin x 3 as well as lice shampoo. Symptoms temporarily subsided and then returned in the same spots and other places. 20 years in the hospital and prehospital setting I had never experienced anyhting of this nature, I was so freaked out that I bought a new bed,new bedding, rugs and drapes. I steamed and deconned other furniture, had air ducts cleaned,bombed my house and car multiple times, washed and bagged every item possible, you name it ....I did it, did a second round of topical permethrin x 2, sulfa baths etc. Things mellowed out leaving areas that resembled mosquito like bites with dark spots in the middle that would come back after a week or so plus new ones. I went to derm and they acted like I was crazy, standing so far away from me I don\'t know how she was able to evaluate eventually telling me contact dermatitis. Offering triamcinalone, keflex and benedryl. I started crying and she eventually said ""fine, Ill give you ivermectin and that will be like an atomic bomb!"" She prescribed one time dose and sent me on my way, they never discussed or called me for follow up lol. After ivermectin things got worse, flaking and bareley improving. I was done with derm and employee health at this point. My PMD did telemed apt and told me to stop steroid, start doxy, permethrin again and 6 more doses of ivermectin. I had about 3 weeks of minor improvement. I had them everywhere at this point in different stages mostly dark outer areas with small dots in the middle or new spots. I am currently off meds for 2 weeks and still having new eruptions. I have been researching everything and am thinking this may be fungalall along as the patient very well could have had ring worm or something of that nature.

Also mentioned in that post that my hr sometimes dips into the 50s during the day.  Didn\'t happen again, didn\'t get a response here so sort of figured it was no biggie, just a random thing. \n\nAbout 10 days ago, talked later with PsyD and decided that part of my depression may be due to not getting shit done, which is likely not helped by the fact that we stopped adderall months ago so maybe we should try bringing it back, keeping an eye on blood pressure and heart rate, etc -- we had stopped because I had a bit of high blood pressure for awhile, but that was actually due to being on Florinef for my LOW blood pressure and now that I\'m really fat I don\'t need the salt retention med so the cardiologist stopped Florinef, blood pressure is back to my normal 95/75-ish even with Adderall. Cool.\n\nSince then I\'ve been really watching my heart rate with the Adderall back on board. Early mornings before I take it hr seems to average 75ish. Two hours after the Adderall, it\'s higher averaging 85ish. The weird shit: nearly any day I can have a resting hr that briefly hits 90s, but in the same day, will drop into the 50s, even in the 4 hours after I take Adderall when I\'d expect it to be higher. Generally neither the extra high or extra low last more than 30 minutes. But the lows are coming more frequently now.  Instead of once a day for 15ish minutes, or a couple blips, for about a week now I\'m noticing that it\'s going down for 45minutes or more, 3 or more times a day. Last night we were watching Kill Bill (so not a chill, meditative movie) and talking, laughing...but I\'m looking at my watch data this morning, and all through the movie my hr was in the 50s.  WTF? \n\nFWIW, I\'m currently \\~5 hours post Adderall, feeling anxious and typing furiously...and my hr is reacting what I consider ""normally"" by sitting in the 90s.'"

Back pain and breast pain as well. Ribs also hurt. Having acid reflux and nausea, complete lack of appetite. Low grade fever and overheating, chills.

I am writing here hoping to get some feedback about next steps for my son (10 yrs old). Today we finally had my sons Autism evaluation that we have been waiting for six months to get. The appointment left me frustrated and at a loss of what to do next. The doctor that we met with is a very prominent one, (he is nationally recognized), so I was excited to be able to see him to get some help. However, the appointment went in a completely different direction. The doctor constantly talked over me and seemed dismissive of any concerns that I had. He asked me if I watched Young Sheldon, and I said yes. He said thats your son, but basically it didnt matter that he had autism. His anxiety was the only issue that needed to be addressed, and to get therapy for three months, and if that didnt work, to put him on Prozac. I know that medication works wonders for some people, but I am not putting my 10 year old child on Prozac. I came to get help to learn how to best interact with my son and support him in his autism. I wanted tips on how to help his food aversion, his struggles with texture, him trying to argue his points without seeing other peoples views, etc., but the answer for him was just therapy and try Prozac. He even said that he thought that he had ADHD (even though he focuses just fine in school and at home), but that having autism was not a reason for any of his struggles. So I guess my question is, do I get a second opinion from someone else about a treatment path for my child?'"

I\'m hoping someone has similar symptoms and might be able to help, plus I want to document/vent.  I\'ll put a tldr at the bottom.\n\nI\'ve been having weird symptoms for the better part of two decades, with them getting worse over time and really bad over the last 3 years. I\'ve been to numerous drs and haven\'t been able to figure it out. I\'m leaning to allergies, but not ruling anything out.\n\nSymptoms:\n\n\\-Chronic Fatigue. I\'d say I have some level of this 80% of the time. Debilitated \\~40% of the time.\n\n\\-Chronic re-occurring \'eye infection\'. This is not an actual infection but appears to be an allergic reaction. It looks like a sty and sometimes pink eye. I get it sometimes weekly. About once a month on average. The eye lid gets red and inflamed, lasts about 5 days always on my right lower eyelid. I feel like complete hell when these are happening. They have been going on for 20 years and nothing has stopped them. Antibiotics/steroids don\'t work. Allergy drops don\'t really help either. It just goes away after about a week.\n\n\\-Chronic Constipation: My intestines swell shut and nothing moves thru. I mean this literally, my drs always raise an eyebrow when I tell them this. I\'m not sure why this is surprising to them. They typically stay swollen for several days up to a week. The only option is to take magnesium until the poop is liquid enough to pass through. Even then, I\'ve had 5 pounds of magnasium poop water sloshing around in my upper intestins for days, it sucks. Eventually the swelling will go down and it will move through. I\'m pretty sure its getting stuck in my small intestines as its getting stuck above my belly button. I\'d say this is about 60% of the time in varying levels of inflammation/constipation. This started about 3.5 years ago. I can \'feel\' when I\'m constipated, I just know nothings moving. No farts get out either.\n\n\\-Depression/Anxiety: I used to be really depressed. CBT worked well for that. My anxiety levels are a lot better now as well. I still have an attack every now and then. Mentally I\'m great when my brain is not foggy.\n\n\\-Weird Pain: I cant describe it, like my nervous system is going haywire. Sometimes its like a burning/tingling sensation all through my body. The best way to describe it is maximum discomfort. I cant get comfortable on my 16"" memory/gel foam mattress. It\'s like a low level restless leg syndrome all over your body. This is about 30% of the time.\n\n\\-RLS: This is pretty rare, but it does happen and the attacks suck! I\'d say I\'ve had it 10 times in the last 3 years. The attack typically lasts a few days.\n\n\\-Chronic insomnia: I usually sleep in 2-3 hour chunks. I\'m lucky if I get 2 chunks in a 24 hour period. I usually feel like hell on waking too. A burning sensation all over my body. This is 90% of the time. I\'d guess I get 3 good nights sleep a month. If I get two sleep chunks in a night I can function that day. Normally the chunks of sleep are between 2-7am and 11am-2pm. I usually go to bed around midnight and fall asleep between 2 and 5 am. Wake up with stomach pain, drink lots of water and lie in bed until about 2pm. If I\'m lucky i\'ll get another hour or two before i give up. The water helps the stomach pain enough to go back to sleep some times. The weird pains effect sleep as well.\n\n\\-Swelling of lungs. This has happened about 5 times, my lungs swell up and make breathing hard. Most of these happened the night after drinking the previous evening. My stomach and intestines swell up as well.\n\n\\-Weird pain just under the breastbone. The little piece of cartilage that sticks out from the bottom of the breastbone will feel tender and hurt constantly. It will happen for weeks at a time, go away, then come back. Another similar thing with my stomach on my left side.\n\n\\-Brain Fog: It can hurt to think or concentrate at times. So much so that playing video games can become painful. I cant even pay attention to the tv. It\'s on to distract my lizard brain, but I really don\'t pay attention and I\'m trying to think about something else. Memory is also hazy to. I\'d say this happens about 50% of the time to some degree. About 20% of the time it\'s completely debilitating. Correlates with the quality and amount of sleep.\n\n\\-Sensitivity to cold: This is a newer one. I\'ve always hated cold, but this last winter was on another level. If it was 50 degrees out I\'d have 4 layers on, with two of them being thermals, and I\'d still feel cold. I\'d basically just sit in bed all day with a heat blanket. Also, my right arm would occasionally just feel cold for no reason. I could be in a hot shower, and only my right arm felt cold. This has been completely gone for a month or so. Now that I mention it, my symptoms seem to be worse when its cold out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHistory:\n\nI\'m 42/M/6\'2""/\\~200lbs. About 15-20 years or so ago, I started getting weird constant burning in my intestines. It would happen only at night. I would always have diarrhea in the morning. This is when I started getting the weird pain. Tingling, uncomfortable, strange pain. I\'ve always has sleeping problems, but it became chronic about this time.\n\nAbout this time, I ended up in the er one day when my lungs swelled up and began feeling dizy/strange. I thought it was a heart attack with all the chest pressure. They ran a bunch of tests and said I had a panic attack. I started feeling better a few hours after being admitted. It made sense to me at the time since I was having anxiety.\n\nI went to the drs a bunch of times for the stomach/weird pains. They said it was gas and everything was fine. This was after countless tests and dr visits. I gave up and started searching on the internet. I ended up deciding my gut microbiome was out of wack and did a month long juice fast and quit drinking. After a few days of drinking only fruit and vegetable juice  I started feeling better. I did only juice for two weeks, then slowly introduced solid food back.\n\nI was good for several years after that. Maybe about 5 years ago, I started having some weird digestive issues. The weird pains started coming back. So I tired the juice again and it didn\'t work this time. So I tired all the other diets. The only thing that appeared to work was a low gluten diet. So I maintained a whole foods, no gluten diet for a while. I was in great shape and feeling better than ever.  I was running the local mountain twice a week, 6 miles with 2k\' elevation change.\n\nThen one night, I was sitting watching tv after dinner and this weird sensation overtook me. It felt like everything above my waist and below my neck swelled up. It stayed swollen for about 8 hours. It was not rely painful at the time, just very uncomfortable and kinda scary. I could not sleep until about 4 am when the swelling went down. I was fine for a week or so, till the same thing happened again. Same conditions. I though about food allergies, but these were meals that I have had hundreds of times but I was not ruling them out. The 2nd time this happened the swelling lasted about 2 days. This \'attack\' started happening more often and lasting longer. As it sits now, its about 3 days off/ 5 days on.  I\'ve been pretty much debilitated since then.\n\nI started seeing a gi dr. Did all the normal tests. All the tests were normal. A bunch of blood tests, ct scan, and a camera up the bum. I tried all the regular medicines for constipation. The only thing that worked at the time was a LOT of magnesium. Prilosec and antacids didn\'t work, so I figured it was not acid based.\n\nI\'ve tired everything up to this point. I\'ve been tested for h-pylori, a number of viruses and bacteria. I had h-pylori, but they said the numbers were ok. I really thought it was bacterial at first based on how fast it hit and how healthy I was at the time. I had just been to the orthodontist and I got a swollen lymph node the night before.  During the visit I had noticed how dirty the screen the tech was touching after having touched it and stuck his fingers in my mouth.  I\'m still not convinced it was not setoff by bacteria or fungus or something like that. I\'ve tried a number of medications and antibiotics and nothing has worked. They even had me on anti-virals for a while.\n\nAt some point i came across a low histamine diet and gave it a shot. After a few days on it I started feeling better. After reading up on histamine, I\'m fairly certain it\'s causing most if not all of my issues. I\'ve since started taking pepcid for my constipation and its worked more than anything, but still not perfect. I wish I tried this first instead of a ppi.  After this I was able to get my gi dr to refer me to an allergy dr. Nothing with him has came up definitive yet, but I\'m optimistic. He\'s mentioned mast cell disorder. The symptoms line up, but that seems to be the case with everything histamine related.\n\nThe only food that I\'m positive impacts me are fermented foods. Beer, especially dark beer, mess me up the following night. I\'m not sure its the alcohol or something else in there as clear liquors and corona don\'t effect me as much. But I quit drinking again a few months ago just to be sure. This is where I think it could be something like a fungus/yeast/bacteria type of deal. Something in alcohol or a byproduct of fermentation might be feeding them. I think the only thing I haven\'t tested for is yeast/fungus. \n\nMost of my blood tests were normal. The only two that raised my eyebrows were my FERRITIN was a little high, and my white blood count was a little low. Neither of these warranted a retest by my dr. so I\'m not worried about them.\n\nI think I\'m on the right track here. I\'m managing my symptoms, and I\'m functional a few days a week, but I\'m not cured and I\'ve eliminated the only food that I\'m sure causes issues.\n\nI\'m investigating airborne allergies now. Before I never would have thought breathing in something would impact my digestive system. I bought a hepa filter and its been running for three days straight and my symptoms appear to be improving.  I have noticed that my symptoms appear to be better when I visit my hometown. I live about 500 miles south of my home town in a warmer/drier climate. I\'ve also got another hepa filter on order. If it\'s airborne, it\'s strange that it does not seem to impact my lungs. Other than the 5 times with my lungs mentioned above, I really have not had breathing issues. I do get the seasonal sinus stuff, but it\'s easily managed.\n\nSorry again for the long post. I hope someone has some ideas or just want to vent. I\'ve been unable to work for about a year and a half and I\'d like to figure this out asap before my skills go to shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I think allergies are causing debilitating constipation and weird pains along with insomnia.'"

Please help I dont know what to do anymore :('",,"b'Im 20f, Im not including a picture because i dont feel comfortable. Im gonna include some backstory and what ive tried already and everything. Sorry for any typos or grammar issues im on my phone but ill try my best.\n\nIve had HORRIBLE acne ever since i was little. Like in elementary school. My facial acne was INSANE. We started by trying topicals, my skin was to sensitive and i couldnt handle the topicals well. Eventually i gave up and just let it be, washed my face but that never helped. My back acne developed in elementary school as well but it wasnt bad at all and it wasnt our orimary focus. In middle school into highschool,i used antibiotics because i refused any type of topical. The first one im forgetting the name but was good it helped my facial acne a lot. I was on it for about a year and then i stopped. so my facial acne by highschool was 1000x better and i didnt mind whatever acne i did have because it was just so much better then it was.\n\n But my back acne was horrible, i have so many scars down my entire back. Sometime during my junior year igot on birthcontrol(the patch) which basically cleared up my facial acne. But not my back acne. I then switched to nexplanon which made no difference in my acne. In the beginning of nexplanon( firdt few months) i got a few cysts but those went away and havent had any since.\n\n\nIm sorry i didnt mention this earlier by back acne i also mean the acne down my arms and on my chest and on my neck. \nIts everywhere.\n\nIve tried everything. So in highschool my senior year i switch to another antibiotic. Im allergic to penicillin and i didnt wanna use the one i used before because im against using antibiotics unless you really need to like for real infections. so i tried this antibiotic and had a horrible allergic reaction to it as well lol so i stopped i never wanna use antibiotics again for acne. \n\nThen i started using this spray, which helped but it was just to expensive and i cant afford buying so much product when im using so much it was a small bottle and it only helped a little like not a lot.\n\nIve tried witch hazel, it doesnt help\n\nI tried nizoral. But i also tried going gluten free at the same time. im also worried about it affecting my birthcontrol so i dont plan to try nizoral again.\nI stopped nizoral but remained gluten free and i was still getting small break outs. But i did notice my skin clearing up tremendously. But i broke my gluten free diet and now im back to square one.\n\nNow why dont you go back to being gluten free? You might ask.\n\nWell i am, i have been for a few weeks now. But my skin is absolutely terrible. but i always noticed my skin gets worse before it gets better so im hoping thats whats happening.\n\nIve tried megadosing on vitamin b5, this actually helped alot but it made my jaw hurt lol so i stopped. \nSo maybe its a vitamin deficiency but ive been taking multivitamins. And i do actually incorporate vitamin b5 more after noticing it making a difference. \n\nWhy not go see a dermatologist?\nI have. I went to one when i was in hs that prescribed me the antibiotics that gave me a terrible allergic reaction. And i just dont wanna go back. Everybody just wants to treat the symptoms not the actual cause and its so frustrating.\n\n\nBasically what ive been doing now. I take a show every other day where i exfoliate( this isnt the reason im breaking out.), and then i will put aloe very all over my body basically because its basically everywhere besides my legs. But it has started appearing on my butt and upper thighs.\n\nI generally dont wear tight clothes. I mostly wear cotton t shirts or hoodies and pj bottoms that arent fitted just loose. i do weae tight jeans though but ive never had an issue with acne on my butt or legs before. \n\nIm really thinking I may have a intolerance to gluten because i feel so much better when i dont eat gluten and my skin clears. I didnt get bad bloating when i went back to eating gluten before but before i tried gluten free i got bloated so easily and so much. But now i dont bloat. Sorry if that was confusing.\n\nSo im just wondering if any of you have any other possible remedies i can try. If being gluten free doesnt work then i probably do plan to go to my doctor to get referred to a dermatologist even though i really just dont trust dermatologists. Also to get tested for a gluten insensitivity.\n\nIm getting really tired of hiding my skin because people always ask whats wrong with my skin lol and its so annoying because like yeah i see it i know its there if i knew what was causing it id fix it asap. Ive never been able to feel comfortable in tank tops or off the shoulder shirts which i love. i actually wanna live lol im so tired of this my brothers dont have acne problems (we are triplets so we are the same age). I dont wanna feel self conscious of my skin anymore. And once the acne is gone i gotta deal with the scars but aloevera realllyyy helps my scarring so im hoping by using it basically every other day its helping.\n\nIf you read this far thank you im so sorry this post is so long. Id really appreciate any suggestions!'"

But still, it's not that rare, compared to developed countries.\n\nRecently, I just developed this fear of rabies. I have two cats, and I'm scared that they'll give me rabies. They're both vaccinated, but they're not indoor cats and they're allowed to go outside. I know they can't get rabies, but I'm scared that somewhere outside, they'll interact with a rabid animal and carry the virus on their fur.\n\nI don't have big wounds, but I do have these tiny wounds from popping blackheads or pimples on my face, or peeling the skin around my fingernail. I also rub my eyes a lot. Is it possible to get rabies in petting the cats and then touching those areas. I also realized that I do those things more often when I'm scared or worried, and it's fueling my fear.\n\nPS: I also searched how long does the virus live outside the host's body. The answers range from a couple minutes to even a few DAYS depending on environmental factors. Those answers didn't help me at all. So technically, if the cat's fur contain the virus and it is licked by the cat, the saliva will provide enough moisture to keep the virus alive. And if I petted them and then rubbed my eyes there's a chance to get rabies?"""

The smell didn\'t go away.\n\nRecently, I had a horrible streak of binging. I had 2.5k-3k cals for like a week just made of bread. I was extremely bloated and my mouth was really dry.

I tested my 19h fasting glucose (from dinner at 5 to when I woke up) and it was 5.0. Then I ate and 1 hour later it was 6.7. Then 2 hours later it was 7.1-7.5.

I guess Im venting and looking for anything I can do to help my wife, and to be patient.\n\nThis is really long, so no worries if you dont want to read it :P. I probably wouldnt.\n\nShe has a bad health anxiety, and has had for years. The short version of the situation is this. \n\nIn her ninth month of pregnancy, she got COVID. A serious matter for sure. She is also unvaccinated because many doctors here were telling us that we are better off staying safe, rather than vaccinating. I am vaccinated, and she was going to do so as soon as the birth was done. We are not anti-vaxx in the slightest.\n\nShe was eventually admitted to hospital with pneumonia, and they had to deliver our baby via c-section so that she could get the medicine she needs. An absolute ordeal and even thinking of it breaks my heart.\n\nShe has not been able to see her baby for 2.5 weeks now, and neither have I. She cannot have visitors.\n\nThe entire time, she has been in an almost comatose panic attack. She has trouble breathing, she cannot cope with it at all. Her lungs are a lot better and OVID is gone, but of course, not being able to sleep or relax and wait it out is having its effect on her recovery.\n\nShe cannot even sit up of stand before suffocating and having panic attacks. She has apparently lost an incredible amount of weight and muscle mass. Its like, she wont help herself because she things she cant. And she cant because she has a panic attack every time she tries to even sit up. Its a fucked up circle.\n\nMe and her family, we are at a loss. We cannot do anything for her, she is in a constant state of panic, for weeks on end now.\n\nI know we cannot simply tell her to relax, breathe and all this stuff. I know thats not how it works. But, we are all completely exhausted with her, as are medical staff. \n\nShe has thankfully had a psychiatrist see her, and is now on anti-anxiety meds since a few days. Hopefully the cumulative effect will help her.\n\nShe is completely unable to acknowledge that her state of mind is seriously affecting her ability to recover so that she and our baby can come home. Her panic is front and centre.\n\nMy ability, and that of her familys ability to be supportive is waning. After weeks of trying to help her through text (its the only way she will intermittently communicate). She has shut herself off from all of us. Frustration is overtaking empathy, as we simply cant get through to her. \n\nHow can we deal with this? We are helpless and exhausted with worry. I just want her to CALM DOWN and help herself. And again, I know this isnt how it works, but she wont even talk about it or acknowledge it. The only thing she talks about is that shes having a panic attack and is in pain.\n\nIts a terrible and sad situation all round. I guess Im just asking, how can I deal with it, and how can I support her better. What do I say when she texts me for the 15th time that day that she cant breathe and his having panic attacks. Its been 2.5 weeks, and probably will continue as she is the only thing standing in her own way for recovering.\n\nI hope I dont come off as uncaring. We have been together for 6 years, and it kills me to know that she is there in the ward, panicking around the clock, and we have a little newborn that neither of us can see. The situation would be hell for anyone, I dont judge her for this. As someone who does not have health anxiety, I guess I just dont understand how it feels. But, at the same time I cant help feeling waves of frustration and disappointment every time she mentions a panic attack multiple times a day.\n\nI just want her to be healthy, but although its not a choice for her, she is the one thing standing in her own way.\n\nIm also worried about when she does finally get discharged. Its going to be a real uphill battle to get her back to mental and physical strength. She will most certainly continue her medication, but I am simply not equipped to be gentle and supportive every single time she has a panic attack. I do manage for most and really work hard to bring her back, but I am human too.\n\nI guess this was a rant, but some perspective and advice on how to handle panic attacks, both for her and myself would be appreciated.'"

Long story short, I (26f) had a planned pregnancy and gave birth to our little one July 23. Never did I imagine things to be this difficult. Hard? Yes. Challenging? Absolutely. But it\'s so much more than that. \n\n\nI\'m lucky to be a stay at home mom. My husband works 7:30a-2p, so I have help. When he gets home from work, we hang out as a family, have supper, then I sleep from about 7p-midnight. My husband goes to bed at 1a. So I\'m getting unbroken sleep, so I wouldn\'t say that\'s my big issue. Yes, staying up with the baby through the night and day until my husband gets home to help is exhausting. We are both exhausted. ""Nap when the baby naps"" is fucking brilliant advice. Truly ground breaking. However, he wakes up as soon as I set him down most of the time. Other times I lay him down and he sleeps maybe 30 minutes. I cannot fall asleep and wake up on my toes that quickly. It\'s not possible for me. He has to be fed as soon as he opens his eyes or he is screaming, as babies do. \n\n\nBeing a stay at home mom with an 8 week old baby has been extremely isolating and lonely. I feel paranoid at night more than before. I constantly worry about SIDS. We had previous miscarriages. I live 2 hours away from my family. My in laws aren\'t people I want to be around. My mom friends have jobs, and babe isn\'t vaccinated yet so playdates aren\'t a thing for us right now. We are currently a single vehicle family, so I can\'t drive us anywhere to get out of the house. Walking our neighborhood isn\'t much of an option, because people let their dogs roam the streets and they\'re aggressive. \n\n\nAll of this is more of a rant/vent, but I\'m looking for advice on how to keep my depression at a minimum while feeling so isolated. The other parent groups talk about postpartum depression/anxiety, but aren\'t diagnosed as bipolar on top of that. I feel like I have ""depression and anxiety x2"" My psych has had me on meds (Lamictal, Buspar) for over a year. But I\'m not sure if anything else can be done. The weight of the guilt for not enjoying the ""happiest time of my life"" is crushing me. I love my baby with all of my being. I do. There are so many horror stories about people seeking help postpartum and child protective services taking their child away. I feel like with my existing diagnosis on file already would make them instantly snatch my baby from me. \n\n\nThanks for sticking to the end of this.'"

Pain located centrally, around and below the navel. Pain was a 6/10.\n- Pelvic pain, unable to move. Felt like my pelvis was being crushed repeatedly. Pain was located in the pubic region, spreading from the centre to either or both sides. Pain was a 9/10.\n- Eczema/rashes, mainly on inner hand and fingers and on the inner leg near the crease of my knee. SUPER ITCHY. Sometimes on arms. Didnt use any creams, it went away on its own. \n\nOngoing symptoms:\n\nNausea, hypersensitive to scents (makes me extremely nauseous, I cant eat food with spices/strong scent), loss of appetite, rapid weight loss, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, vision darkening, eye floaters, tinnitus when experiencing severe vertigo, short-term memory loss, confusion, distortion, malnutrition bruises, bruising easily,  on/off hip pain (feels like theyre bruised), on/off back pain (spine and lower back extreme discomfort), muscle pain (quadriceps feel extremely sore most days as if I did an intense strength training session on my legs), on/off upper arm pain like theyre bruised, on/off collarbone pain like theyre bruised, vomiting: bile/after a coughing fit/after eating, night sweats, sweaty and seriously sticky hands, thirsty, frequent urination, hunched/stooped over when walking, palpitations, also my urine is darker and smells strong (maybe like ammonia?) which I assume is because I dont get enough nutrients. \n\nExtra details: I eat maybe one actual meal a week if Im lucky. I will have little snacks some days, a few bites of something that I truly have to force myself to eat to the point I feel sick and I have to stop so I dont throw up. I usually go 2-3 days at a time without eating anything at all though I started to recently take multivitamins, and I have been consistently drinking a lot of water and electrolytes since the beginning of all of this. I throw up probably 5/7 days of the week, and more often, bile now since as the time goes by, I eat less and less. \n\nIn February, I got a 30 day prescription for JAMP-dimenhydrinate (this did not help me much, but it helped with my coughing fits a little bit) and Dexillant which I had to stop taking after barely a week because it gave me steatorrhea so severe, I went to the bathroom 7 times in a 12 hour timeframe which resulted in me getting two haemorrhoids (they are gone now) and losing 4 lbs. It didnt even benefit me in the end as it did not build an appetite for me, though helped alleviate my daily morning nausea, but not enough to completely suppress it. \n\nMarch 27, I got a lymph node on my neck that went down, but came back up again, normal grape size.\nToday, I feel another lymph node on my armpit, the size of a fat blueberry. \nI did a CBC and a bunch of other blood tests on March 25 that would indicate no infection however my CRP level was slightly elevated. \nThings ruled out (I have done between 2-5 different blood tests for these because every doctor thinks the result is going to somehow change): Crohns disease, anemia, celiac disease, thyroid disorders, diabetes, Bergers disease, cirrhosis, hypophosphatasia. \n(I also say 2-5 because I did 5 CBCs in total and some of them didnt have repeats of certain things). \n\nI have a gastroscopy coming up soon, but Im just waiting and waiting and waiting for a date, and at this point, dont know if going to the ER will do anything, I will probably still be treated as unimportant and non-urgent even though Ive lost so much weight so rapidly.

It just makes me more confused and doubt my own insomnia and suffering more. See my other recent post. \n\nSleep hygiene is immaculate.\n\nIve tried most (not all) of the common meds (ones Ive tried below) and they either dont work or I had a terrible reaction to them. \n\nThe only thing Ive tried that helps is klonopin. I used to take it on a long-term basis (three years) and it continued working over all of that time with no reduction in efficacy or dose escalation, but all of the fear mongering got to me and I tapered off (zero withdrawals btw). Id sleep through the night and wake up refreshed with a ton of energy. But I know that even if it works long term, youre not supposed to use it that way. So I stopped and it went back to how it was before I took it. Interesting to note is that during PSG tests, my sleep is shitty and shallow and fragmented.  But on klonopin it was defragmented and I suddenly got more slow wave sleep and less REM (I get too much REM) and it all happened in the right order (not usual for me). So, it actually improved my sleep parameters, unlike what you normally read about benzos. \n\nThe honorable mention goes to pregabalin. I had it prescribed for pain and it had slight improvement in my sleep, but I never felt as refreshed and alert as with klonopin. Slightly foggy, even. \n\nThird honorable mention to zyprexa, but it turned me into a zombie and the side effect profile is scary. Since I dont have a disorder that its indicated for, Ill skip it. \n\nBut an incomplete list of what Ive tried and didnt work or reacted poorly to:\n\nDoxepin, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, mirtazapine, trazodone, zolpidem, eszopiclone, seroquel, hydroxyzine, indica/sativa, CBD, low and mid-dose melatonin, gabapentin, magnesium citrate, Xyrem, methocarbamol, cyclobenzaprine, baclofen, tizanidine. \n\nIve also tried most of the supplements people on this sub mention. \n\nThere are probably some more Im forgetting (because its now 3am and Ive not gotten more than 3.5 hours of sleep for a couple of weeks). Ill update this list as I remember. \n\nIve got mainly maintenance insomnia. I physically cant keep my eyes open in the evening. I hold myself awake until I am literally falling over asleep. Like, Im so sleepy by 11pm  I repeatedly will fall asleep standing up and have to get myself to bed immediately. But then Im awake 3 hours later. \n\nId like something that will work over the long term. The gold standard CBT-I hasnt helped me. But the drugs that work are only supposed to be taken short term. \n\nHas anyone found a long term strategy?\n\nAlso FWIW, I took 10mg zolpidem before bed.

losartan,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/z1w3yd/advice_on_reporting_practitioners_prescribing/,b'Advice on reporting practitioners prescribing losartan and aliskiren to elderly patient?',,"b'\nEdit: thanks everyone for your input. Im only in my third year of practice and when my friend said it should be reported I didnt know what to do. Id also like to point out that this is one of many many inappropriate or dangerous prescriptions Ive seen from this office. I already spoke with the office about the dangerous combo. It was a very professional and good conversation however the NP did not sound like she was going to make any changes to the regimen. I hope the lady doesnt end up in the hospital in kidney failure or severe hyperkalemia. The hospitalist Im on with was also horrified and wanted to change the regimen but was afraid to do it without the ability to follow up. \nIm NOT reporting this situation to anyone but I did document the hell out of all of it. Going forward Im going to keep a detailed log of all the dangerous prescriptions I have noticed. Just in case. \n\nAlso Id just like to say, just because you get a patient in who has been on medications for a while and you didnt initiate them, dont make assumptions. Run a quick drug-drug interaction report or consider the change in kidney function the patient may have experienced. Or ask your friendly neighborhood pharmacist for help :) \n-\n\nI posted this on r/pharmacy also. \n\nI work as an inpatient pharmacist. We have a local PCP who I often find will prescribe meds that are inappropriate for his patients for various reasons (e.g. elderly patient on 3 anticholinergics admitted for what ended up being anticholinergic side effects) or will prescribe high risk meds and not follow up (methadone without frequent EKGs). Its been a pattern since Ive been working here that we will get his patients in to the hospital and I end up finding inappropriate meds on their med lists.\n\nAnyway, we had a patient get admitted yesterday. She is 93, CrCl of 22 ml/min. She is taking losartan and aliskiren (Tekturna). To me this is shockingly inappropriate and dangerous. After some digging the patient has been on this combo since at least 2013, originally prescribed by some doctor in a different state she moved from, and now for the past 2 years prescribed by this PCP Im talking about and his nurse practitioner.\n\nI called over to ask about it and recommend a change in therapy ASAP, I spoke with the nurse practitioner. Her answer was that she had no idea it was dangerous and she just continued it without question because the patient had been on it for a while.\n\nI mentioned it to friend of mine who is also a pharmacist at a different hospital, he thinks its bad enough that it needs to be reported to the board of medicine and board of nursing.\n\nI also am concerned that a local pharmacy has been filling these for years.\n\nLooking for some thoughts and opinions on if I should let it go now that I at least brought it to their attention or move forward with reporting?'"

Every time I bring up an issue (trouble concentrating, anhedonia, weight gain, trouble sleeping) he just prescribes new medications. I\'m currently prescribed naltroxene (""for dissociation""), olanzapine, lamotrigine, Cymbalta, lithium, Abilify, and Victoza (""for weight loss from medication weight gain""). \n\nI have been fairly stable since starting medication, but still experience mild mood swings. Haven\'t had a full-blown manic episode since starting Abilify, but I\'ve had depressive episodes which have evened out with lamotrigine. I want to switch from Cymbalta to Wellbutrin after reading about the medication, to hopefully get back my old weight and sex drive, and since Cymbalta\'s never done much for my depression - although my psychiatrist doesn\'t seem to take that as a hint to take it away. \n\nI have a plethora of side effects which make my psych add even more medications to my growing list. I\'ve stopped filling the naltroxene and olanzapine prescriptions because they made me feel dead and I couldn\'t leave my bed from sleeping so much. Abilify has given me tardive diskenisia and still my psych just says to lower the dose. I want to stay on lamotrigine and Wellbutrin (if it works out for me) and cut everything else, and maybe start a different antipsychotic like Seroquel if I find my manic episodes/psychotic symptoms coming back.\n\nThe thing is I\'m not good at being firm with medical personnel, I\'ve never felt listened to by them. Even when I bring up being on less medications he just says, ""Yeah, we\'ll talk about that in the future.""

I don't remember damaging my toe, though it does sometimes press into the sides of my shoes because of the wedges I have to wear to keep my Achilles tendonitis from hurting. In terms of thickness, they don't seem any thicker than normal. The left one did have ridges that I filed off a bit due to the peeling layer (I didn't want it to get worse), but it looked similar to the ridges on my right. There were a couple of horizontal ridges in addition to the vertical ones, though. I am concerned that it could be fungal due to the color, so I used a blacklight and...they do glow, albeit faintly. None of my other toenails do this. The only other part of my foot that glowed was the callous on the right side, under my big toe. Could you please tell me if this actually looks fungal?!

Because I have been completely therapy resistant to all the SSRIs, SNRIs and one MAOI as well as a tricyclic. Im also in behavioral therapy right now, just to let you know.\n\nI only took 300mg every morning before breakfast for the last 7 days and well, it was more effective than any other med I tried. My depression was 90% vanished. My cognition (focus, memory, logical thinking) started being functional again. I didnt feel dumbed out and cognitively retarded anymore. I even felt smart. I especially noticed  my better cognition in social events and conversations a lot but also at reading, following movies and just remembering general knowledge. My head didnt feel empty and dysfunctional anymore. My brain was working again.\n\nIt did more for my depression than my social anxiety but hell sure the cognitive improvements helped with socializing too. I still felt some kind of nervous before having to socialize but when I was in the social situation I was much more talkative, funny and social. I was enjoying my ability to think clearer, finally being cognitively more functional and definitely feeling some reduced social anxiety.\n\nI know that my dose of 300mg is very low, so I think that a higher dose might not only help my depression and negative thinking but maybe also increase the social anxiety reducing effects.\n\nWhat I would like to know of you guys:\n\n1. If you have some experience with using Gabapentin for depression and/or social anxiety, what fose have you been on and what effects or changes did you notice regarding depression, negative thinking, mood, energy/motivation and especially social anxiety and sociability/talkativeness/extroversion.\n\n2. Ive only been taking the gabapentin daily for 6 days now as I heard a lot about its withdrawals being hellish and horrible af. Whats your opinion on this or do you eve have any experiences with withdrawals? How bad are they, how long do they last after how much time on daily gabapentin?\n\n3. Is it possible to use gabapentin occasionally on a only if needed basis? Or is it needed for depression and anxiety disorders to take it daily for better effects and symptom reduction?Like 3-4 days a week only to hinder tolerance and withdrawal. Thats what I would do it like if possible as I have experience with GABA withdrawals and they are not nice.\n\nGabapentin is the only thing that worked for me but it seems unrealistic to have and use it as a daily medication for my depression and social anxiety, I guess. What do you think? What are your suggestions?'"

I have given everyone that replied to me an arrow up on every post. Before everyone goes to work and this post slides down the page I just wanted to summarize the actions Im going to take. I want you all to know this post wasnt just to cope, action will be taken because of your suggestions.\n\nCFS leak had the most votes. Some kind of blood test can detect if its cranial but supposedly not spinal. Gonna ask my doctor how to test in a way that is more exact than just taking Theophylline. \n\nOrrion suggested chronic sub-occipital trigger points and it might be aspie bias but if I had to guess Id guess this is the one. It will be getting investigated thoroughly. Still wish he would help me find an appropriate neck brace though.\n\nCouple people said sleep on your back. I wish I could. This is probably the best advice that I wont be able to take.\n\nVestibular migraines were suspiciously absent from the suggestions but based on the medication history I gave you maybe it was right to skip over them. Plenty of these meds should have helped if that was the problem. Still, 1 person suggest I go read at their sub and I will!\n\nAccidents have been mentioned a few times. As for being rear ended twice, once at full speed, you saw my neck mri results  my doctors dont think its that. As for the eye injury my neurologist is trying to get my insurance to pay for a Scleral lens to compensate for the corneal scar as we speak.\n\nCraniocervical Instability was mentioned and I definitely want to be tested for that. Looks like Ive got to do a stand up MRI. IT SHALL BE DONE as soon as my insurance agrees to pay.\n\nThebackright mentions chronic cervicogenic headaches and I have to agree I see the similarities. The way its always happening, it doesnt come and go. And the way it hurts but it doesnt pulse or throb. I definitely need to check this better.\n\nA physician suggested SPG block while noting its probably not going to be my magic cure-all but its low risk, convenient, it can help some, and Im kind of down to just trying things. I agree with all those points. It will be having this done.\n\nC4theruned came in hot. It seems I will eventually have to try amytriptiline 20mg even though I dont want to. And My doctor feels Occipital neuralgia has been disproven by a C2:C3 medial branch block but I do not. Not sure how Im going to handle this. Its the same doctor that will not re-order another round of trigger point injections because it only helped 2 hours the first time. \n\nSuggs41 I dont know how to summarize what you said but send me a DM about how to diagnose weak muscles or a link to a video to copy exercises please. Especially since you say proper form is critical. I need more to go on. I dont think typing strengthening neck muscles into youtube will be me in the right place.\n\nTo that dude that told me Midrin stopped being produced in 2009 but maybe I could make my own- Yea maybe. Not sure how bad things will have to get before I do a Breaking Bad impression but its on the table \n\nTo that person that didnt read the post and told me to see a neurologist I still gave you a thumbs up. Its that kind of day. POSITIVE VIBES. Im feeling optimistic and grateful, I have a lot of great ideas to test.\n\nKoalawedgie says get tested for high PTH, low vitamin D, low bone density, supplement vitamin D (I already do btw because I found out it was low 2 years ago), and take Citrical slow release calcium. Doesnt high PTH mean you already have too much calcium? This post was a head scratcher for me but if I can make sense of it Ill try it. Jaw stretching helps me too but only on the mild headaches. I assume those are tension headaches. They dont help my bad ones. I think the way you do it over your head is stretching your neck muscles too. That might be helping.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n========================back to original post===============\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts so debilitating I couldn\'t even be a landlord any more.  I had to sell my houses.  It has ruined my life. Thats the easiest job on earth, its not even a job. **My pain is inline with the top of my upper lip, just under my nose except its in the back.  Thats my brainstem, right?**  It feels like its being squeezed. But squeezed evenly.  Its not a pulsing or a throbbing.\n\nWhy are anticholinergics & propranolol the only things that help my headaches? **Does that indicate what kind of headache I\'m having**?\n\nNon-stop headaches 24/7. Laying on my side and tilting my head back is the only thing I can do to help besides take pills.  Triptans dont help at all. Sometimes when its really bad more than just that 1 spot hurts, the entire brain hurts (except behind the eyes) but the pain is not spread out evenly. The back definitely hurts a lot more. The top half of my forehead is just a ""tightness"" in comparison. If I take Wellbutrin it severely intensifies the pain in the top half of my neck, brain stem, cerebellum, maybe occipital area too. It literally felt like it was getting crushed. I never have pulsing/throbbing pains. Replaced the Wellbutrin with Strattera and it doesn\'t hurt nearly as much but it does still hurt and I need something for my ADHD. I\'ve always got car sick. If I tried to read a book I\'ll be sick for hours after reading 1 page. I\'ve always got bad headaches if I work under something looking upward (like someone working under a car). If I\'m on my hands and knees and rotate my head to look left or right I\'m going to get a headache and feel sick but I never throw up. I feel like my headaches and this ""sickness"" that never leads to throwing up overlap most of the time.\n\nIt is made much worse by SSRI. **SSRI cannot be tolerated without Cyproheptadine**. I believe I am serotonin hyper-sensitive. Without Cyproheptadine I cannot take SSRI, SNRI, Benzos, or the Tricyclic I tried for a few days (yea that was my worst effort, sorry). I though it was a vestibular issue but I passed the Caloric Stimulation test (pure torture btw, one of the worst days of my life) and I never have to deal with a spinning sensation unless i bounce out of bed or I\'m in the dark.  Its practically nothing. I don\'t get dizzy more than twice a year and I think that is only in a pitch black room. Motion makes it much worse. I have tinnitus. Tilting my head a lot reduces the pain. Its never 1 hemisphere of my brain. I have no idea please help.\n\nHead MRI looks good.\n\nNeck MRI shows minor problems that docs say shouldn\'t be causing this but here they are:\n\n1. Straightening of cervical lordosis.\n2. Multilevel mild degenerative disc disease changes at C3-C7 with multilevel mild canal stenosis. There is no disc protrusion or cord compression.\n3. Mild diffuse facet degenerative changes as described.\n\nThe consistency and evenness of pain (no throbbing) made me think cervicogenic headache.  But the location seems to indicate migraine. And I don\'t know where the motion sickness headaches fit in.  Maybe thats just a separate issue.\n\n***EVERYTHING THAT HELPS IS ANTICHOLINERGIC OR PROPRANOLOL:***\n\nCyproheptadine - helps headache and allows me to take serotonergic meds  \nMeclizine - might not be helping the same head issues as the other 5  \nBenadryl  \nDoxylamine  \nKlonopin  \nPropranolol\n\nThe Cyproheptadine causes my serotonin meds to work less well.\n\nThe Propranolol crushes the effectiveness of my norepinephrine meds.\n\nI have to take all of that to not have a headache. I can\'t keep taking 5 anticholinergics. Its making me eat non-stop, I\'m lazy, I cant remember anything, and I\'m going to get dementia/Parkinsons/Alzheimers. I have to figure out whats wrong with me and find a better way to treat it.\n\n***MEDS THAT DIDN\'T HELP:***  \nPercocet  \nTramadol  \nFioricet  \nEmgality - 4 months - still cant tell  \nQulipta  \nAmlodipine  \nRizatriptan  \nSumatriptan  \nPepcid AC  \nZyrtec  \nMagnesium  \nAdvil, Tylenol, Meloxicam, caffeine - didn\'t help but gave me rebound headaches\n\nTENS machine didn\'t help\n\n**Trigger Point Injection day was frigging awesome. For 2 hours I felt like a normal person.** They said the fact that it was only 2 hours meant it failed. They said I had to be responding to the numbing medicine and not the real medicine they shot in there. (its worth mentioning that I always felt amazing after the pain of laser hair removal the rest of the day. That had to be endorphins, right? So I guess this could have been endorphins too but it only lasted 2 hours, not the rest of the day so i doubt it). **When I got trigger point injections i got 4 up the left side of my neck up to the base of my skull and 4 injections up the right side straight across from the other 4.**\n\nMedial Branch Block was so painful I have no idea how I would know if it helped. The pain from their injection lasted 6 hours but the medicine they shot in there only lasts 2 hours according to them. So how would I know if it worked? But My guess would be this is way too low down my neck and not the problem.\n\n***MAYBES OR  CONFLICTS:***\n\nTizanidine - Seemed to help at first but I was taking Wellbutrin back then. Has not helped since I quit the Wellbutrin so I\'d guess the Wellbutrin was creating tension headaches.\n\nBotox - Seemed to help at first and allowed me to take much less Tizanidine (from 8mg a day to 2mg) but I was taking Wellbutrin back then. I never go more than 3 months to let it all expire so I can\'t be sure if its helping now or not. I think its helping tensions headaches, not migraines.\n\nPregabalin - Helped by the smallest amount anything ever helped by. No where near worth the side effects. I\'m really unimpressed with this medication.\n\nTheophylline - makes me feel a little weird, hard to tell but if it helps its only a very small amount.\n\nHydroxyzine - is the only anticholinergic I tried that didn\'t help my headaches and I am guessing thats because it increases serotonin and it was before I was on Cyproheptadine.\n\nI\'ve never been tested for Autism but I\'m probably on the spectrum. My dad wouldn\'t get tested and he\'s 5 times weirder than me so I felt like I never had the option. I mention this because it has been said autistic people experience pain differently and I think they are putting it kindly... When I had laser hair removal they said I was the biggest baby they ever treated. So I want you to know the way I describe these pains might seem off to you normal people.'"

influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/12n8jt9/getting_desperate_how_much_does_moving_help/,b'Getting desperate: how much does moving help???',,"b'Hi all,\n\nLong post / rant; just need to get a lot of stuff off my chest. \n\nI have been having increasingly severe seasonal allergies each year for the past 10-15 years. During that same time, the winters where I live have become non-existent and the other seasons have become hotter and more humid. I actually had to leave my job during the pandemic because the spring allergy season combined with the first two covid vaccinations sent me into a health nosedive that I haven\'t fully come out of.  Literally felt like I had one foot in the grave. \n\nI\'m in the mid-atlantic with bad overall really air quality, sea level, little breeze, rural area with TONS of vegetation, all of which I\'m allergic to. My family moved here when I was 21, and so maybe part of the problem is not growing up around all these allergens. Also I had surgery as a baby and was on antibiotics constantly my first few years of life, which really effs up one\'s immune system. Have tried local honey, shots, pretty much every supplement and medication and diet / lifestyle hack known to man.\n\nSo yeah, I feel a bit like I\'m in an abusive relationship. \n\nInstead of some manipulative jerk who cries and offers flowers and hugs post-abuse, I\'ve got allergies that fade away now and then, just long enough for me to lose inertia with getting the f out of here. \n\n(It really is kinda weird how hard it is for me to remember the true levels of physical and social and financial hell caused by my allergies when they\'re not acting up, such as dead of winter.)\n\nFeel like I just need to GET OUT NOW, and figure out the fine details once I\'m out. \n\nBut with allergies it\'s so damn tricky figuring out where to go! \n\nI\'m curious where others have gone and found some relief. Places I\'ve lived where allergies have been a bit better include Pacific NW, Vermont, higher elevations, big cities, and places with long winters. It would be great to find a place without much Lyme disease as I\'ve already had it twice, and believe me, combining it with severe allergies is not a pretty picture, or easy to fully recover from.\n\nI\'m just trying to figure out where I go from here. I feel like any non-drastic solutions are just bandaids that will land me back in the same spot before long. If I\'m going to make a big move / pursue a drastic solution, I really want to get it right.\n\nWould love to hear from others who have made a big move to improve the allergy situation and found it helped.\n\nThis year the pollen burst forth around Valentine\'s day, so I have been very ill since then, currently dealing with a sinus infection that doesn\'t want to go away, plus the usual allergy symptoms and aches and pains and brain fog and lethargy, etc etc etc. I\'ve had to miss a few days of work and since I don\'t get paid sick days plus being part-time at minimum wage it\'s a real financial hit (as I alluded to, I had to leave a decent-paying full-time job with benefits, until the allergies spiraled out of control). \n\nMy job ends in a month so I OUGHT to be applying for new jobs right now but with 6 weeks of sinus infection from hell that has been a verrry slow process.\n\nMy house is another part of the problem. It is from 1950 and just has a root cellar style basement so when it rains water gets in; the water eventually seeps away and while there is minor mold, it\'s not mold city. However I\'m sure it\'s enough to trigger me even with an air purifier in my bedroom. The house is also in a damp location in general and one side is almost always shaded by the neighbor\'s house so that side of our house never dries out and has had termites, and is always damp even with dehumidifiers running.\n\nI bought the house from a few family members right before the 2008 crash so I am most likely going to lose money when I sell it. That\'s fine (not ideal, but since the house is part of what\'s slowly killing me I no longer care about money!!). \n\nEvery time I get a contractor to look at the individual issues I can afford to fix (well, formerly could afford to fix), they warn that starting to fix any of them could lead to a ""can of worms"" situation that could easily run into the tens of thousands of dollars, if not hundreds of thousands, as the house was neglected for decades before I moved in (keep in mind I moved in before I realized how bad my allergies would get living in this part of the US!). Since I was originally renting, not buying, I never had the house inspected either.\n\nSo at this point, I\'m getting offers of $50K cash for the house, which is like they\'re just paying me for the land basically. A few years ago a real estate agent said I could probably get close to $100K for it; that may be a tad optimistic; depends how closely people look at it.\n\nHowever, my allergies have gotten so off the charts I\'m actually starting to consider the offers of the 50K. House is fully paid off. I\'m in my 50s and would love to retire at some point, preferably before age 80.\n\nSo part of the question is, can I even begin to ""stage"" the house and do a few cosmetic improvements given my allergies not giving me a break these past few years? I hate to say I can\'t handle even that, but based on harsh reality, it does seem like sadly, I can\'t handle even that.\n\nOkay, so let\'s say I do get rid of this millstone around my allergic neck for 50K. Then what? There are not many places I can move to where that money would go too far, and it\'s my only money; there is no retirement account or savings (there was, but every time allergies became debilitating, that money went to survival stuff and dr appts and meds not covered by insurance etc).\n\nMy few family members live in the same area, in houses that I\'m also  very allergic to. \n\nLooking at a map of the US and where the cheap houses are, it\'s almost all east of the Mississippi and in areas where allergy season is the same as or worse than where I am now, so that\'s a bummer. (Kinda makes me wonder if subconsciously the general public ""gets"" that certain areas are less triggering and therefore those areas are now super pricey...)\n\nI do have distant family in Arizona, near Florence... have friends in Ashland, Oregon, Seattle, Washington, Sydney, Australia, Central Vermont, Colorado, and Chicago, Illinois-Madison, Wisconsin area. Any other sufferers have any luck in these places?\n\nI\'m willing to move almost anywhere.\n\nI need a ""halfway house"" for allergy sufferers who are considering moving to a new place but who don\'t want to commit before trying the place out! ;-)\n\nIf I could just find a place to live in where I\'m not fighting to breathe and dealing with non-stop sinus infections and bronchitis and pneumonia, and where I could exercise again, and work full-time again, then I\'m sure I could pull my life back together... I think a huge help would be to live in a place where people work to live, and put their personal lives and hobbies and friends and down time above their work lives. \n\nWhere I live now is the opposite, so if you don\'t work more than full time and treat your job like it means more to you than your friends and family and hobbies and health combined, you\'re a weirdo. \n\nThat ""discrimination"" if I can call it that is not helping my physical or mental health at all. It also makes it harder for me to ""sell myself"" during job interviews. No, I won\'t sacrifice every last ounce of my health and sanity for this job; sorry! \n\nI want to thrive, not just survive!!\n\nAny advice? Or others feeling in a similar boat? Or ideas on jobs I can do part-time even when allergies are slaying me? \n\nThanks for reading all this and thanks in advance for helpful, positive feedback.'"

No big deal, that\'s fine. I lost probably 10 lbs the first month. Again, I was 172 lbs so it wasn\'t really a big deal. \n\nIt started getting progressively worse and the ick would get more sensitive where I\'d just look at some food and develop the ick. And I\'m talking some of my favorite foods, pizza, tacos. About a month ago I pretty much stopped being able to eat. I\'d look at food and my stomach would immediately churn and I would feel like I was gonna vomit immediately. Last week I spent over $150 on doordash in a single day ordering meals from every single one of my favorite food places, and I couldn\'t get past more than a single bite. So it\'s not for lack of trying. I\'ve dumped so much money into trying to cook anything that I would find appetizing. When I walked through the grocery store I felt nauseated even looking st the food. Not even candy which is my downfall. I\'ve been surviving by having a baguette plate where I just cut up like 10 slices of French bread and leave them on a plate and munch on them throughout the day to keep myself upright. This morning I weighed myself and I\'m down to 146 lbs. So far I\'ve waited to seek medical help because I thought it was potentially a depressive episode, but I suppose now it\'s going to turn into a bit of a rush job because the part where I\'ve started fainting spells is here. I know this isn\'t good but part of me is turning my nose up at the possibility that I\'m going to get committed into the hospital for an eating disorder or something of the sort. I live alone, I\'ve got two dogs and I\'m paycheck to paycheck. I cannot afford to pay someone to watch my dogs and I cannot afford to lose my job. \n\nSo to recap, I\'m extremely hungry.

No other random symptoms. Tested negative for covid. No fever. 172lbs > 146 lbs. Fainting spells starting today. \n\nHas anyone gone through something similar?

I researched things that could help with withdrawal, and people recommended 5-HTP as a good supplement. I took it for about a month or so, maybe a month and a half. I didn't notice anything different when taking it, so I eventually stopped taking it. I probably stopped taking it in July 2020.\n\nI went back on 10mg Lexapro in late September 2020, and about 3 weeks into that, suddenly had horrible and now chronic health problems such as brain fog, extreme fatigue, body weakness, nerve numbness, muscle pain, neck stiffness, chest pain, memory loss, sinus inflammation, and blunted emotions and libido.\n\n**I did not take 5-HTP at the same time as the Lexapro, I am 99.9% sure of it, and only took it as a temporary replacement.**\n\nI am no longer on Lexapro, and I have seen some improvement with my issues. My health problems only began once I re-tried Lexapro. I had been around medical professionals and at an ER for anxiety reasons, so it is possible that I caught a virus like COVID, which I've seen cause many of the symptoms I have.\n\nI believe the 5-HTP I got at the time was an over the counter 200mg supplement that you can get at CVS, [this one](https://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/350833/900.jpg) to be exact. I took it once a day.\n\nI didn't feel sick at all when taking the 5-HTP, so I'm pretty sure it wasn't the cause of my health problems, but maybe people here would know better? I linked the detailed version of my story above, because repeating it here would be too lengthy. I explain all the medical testing I have had done since this started.\n\nI don't think it was serotonin syndrome, as nothing like that happened when I took the 5-HTP.

It is only on my legs. Mostly lower legs but has spread above my knees now. It started out with just a few red bumps and just keeps progressively getting worse. The bumps do not itch but they hurt. They are dark red in the center and lighter around the border. They eventually scab over and fade away on their own but are replaced by new ones. They are pustules and not blanchable. Background info that may also be helpful-I have Crohns disease and I am a nurse. It always seems to get worse after being on my feet all day at work and better on days I dont work. It also started 3 days after my covid booster which may or may not be relevant. \n\nI first tried several steroid creams with no success. I have gotten 2 skin biopsies done. The first one came back as excoriated dermal hypersensitivity reaction such as drug eruption. My doctor took me off humira thinking it was the cause. It didnt help. I did a week course of steroids which helped but it came back as soon as I stopped the steroids. I went back for another biopsy and it came back as folliculitis. I did a course of bactrim, which did not help. \n\nI went back to the derm and he did a culture of one of the pustules, nothing grew. He told me he thought it was Henoch-Schnlein purpura and put me on a 3 week course of prednisone. This completely cleared it up but a few days after coming off the steroids it came back. \n\nCBC and metabolic panel are both normal. Hepatitis panel negative.

I\'m gonna go ahead and apologize bc this will be a long one.\n\nI\'m a 33f, always been described as bouncy, fluffy and basically a hyper person. It\'s something managed and dealt with my whole life. I get extremely productive spikes and then will randomly just be an absolute goblin refusing to do even basic needs like taking a shower. \nI collect hobbies, diving into them feverishly, only to randomly lose all interest, allowing stuff to sit on a shelf never or rarely to be messed with again.\nI will be the best, most attentive friend and then fall off the face of the earth.\nI am incredibly spontaneous and will randomly just decided to take off for the day but at the same time panic about walking into a Lowe\'s because idk \n\nThese are all things I\'ve managed. I\'ve also had social anxiety, but it was mainly centered around new situations and would generally go away once I was actively in those moments. I found smoking the devil lettuce was also something I really only enjoyed doing by myself as it would spike my social anxiety around people.\n\nHowever in Mar. 2023, I had three sicknesses back to back. Nothing major but enough to take it\'s toll, the last one being possible strep so I was put on amoxicillin. \n\nAbout day two into amoxicillin I was out in my garage, normal day, took a hit off a bowl (I\'ve always been an extreme light weight so I stick to flower and maybe two hits is all I need) then went inside.\n\nI suddenly had a massive breakdown. Extreme panic attack. Had to call my s/o to come home.\n\nThe next 2 weeks was a state of nothing but panic attacks. Constantly in the mornings. I could not escape my head. My thoughts were racing so fast that it made me feel like every second I was about to take off running. I felt absolutely out of my mind and yet paralyzed inside of it. Could not stop the panic attacks so went to my doctor. In that time I also entirely stopped smoking weed and drinking caffeine as it was proving to be a trigger. I still have not resumed either of those things.\n\nAt first she was sure it was a thyroid storm brought on by the sicknesses. However after three different blood tests, urine test and even a EKG everything came back... Fine. My thyroid was perfectly healthy. In that time she had put me on Propanol to lower my heart rate (as it was elevated when she saw me) and given Lorazepam for spikes (that stuff was wonderful at making me feel almost normal again but I avoided taking it unless absolutely necessary bc of potential for addiction) \n\nSo she went on to give me stuff for a possible anxiety related illness. Continue Lorazepam only for spikes and wanted to start me on Lexapro (5mg as I am very small 104 pounds and previously all medications I\'ve needed a lower dose) Lexapro was an absolute nightmare. I was back to the peak of the episode that started this whole thing. Stuck inside my head, mornings I was an absolute jittery mess on the edge of panic attack. I would have to get up 3 hours before I needed to leave the house because I\'d spend 2 hrs laying in bed in an attempt to calm myself enough to just get ready for the day. Zero appetite, zero sex drive (least of my problems) extremely irritable. \n\nFor some reason I convinced myself I was being dramatic and stuck it out for a week before I reached out to my doctor who immediately said I needed to stop taking it. \n\nWithin 4 days things leveled back out, I still don\'t feel like who I was before this whole thing started. For context I was VERY happy. I had, in the passed two years, finally fell in love with.myself. I enjoyed who I was, was very confident in myself and loved life. I barely had any sort of anxiety. Now I no longer can have coffee, can smoke to relieve stress (those two really are just kind of sad not my main issues) I live with anxiety every single day. The mornings still being the worst part of it. But no longer spiraling like I was at the beginning of this or on the Lexapro. \n\nOnce things leveled, my doctor had me answer a bunch of questions. She even said she was so surprised bc at the start of this she could of swore it was just a thyroid storm. However I never really had told her about any of my daily issues, bc before this, they really were not something that bothered me. I loved when I became wildly productive and yes it did suck when I\'d suddenly lose it half way through some random project but I managed. After speaking she has stated she believes i could be bipolar and asked if id be comfortable trying medication for it. \n\nI have to admit, after the Lexapro I am very very apprehensive. It took me right back to when this whole ordeal started and it was terrifying. Every day felt like a month and I was physically fighting it felt like just to do basic tasks. But I also know that whatever started all this wasn\'t medication and could happen again. I just want to be back to the person I was before all this, if that\'s even possible. \n\nI guess I am attempting to see if my experience matches any of you here. I must admit I don\'t know very much about bi polar and if any of this are things you\'ve all dealt with. I\'m looking for information, I haven\'t given my doctor a yes or no yet. As of right now I am ""ok"" (again not who I was before all this still very low energy, higher anxiety and just not myself) but I worry about doing nothing. Any advice or insight on this absolute girthy tale is going to be VERY appreciated. \n\nKeep being fantastic everyone!'"

As psychiatric patients, we are often psychologically and physically vulnerable to the medications we are prescribed and the assumption is that we will be taking psychotropic medications for a lifetime and will never be ""cured"".**\n\n**Respectfully, as a woman who works in health care, I know that there is a population of individuals that benefit from these medications and will have to take psychotropic medications for their lifetime. Please understand that I am not critical or judgemental of these healthcare scenarios.**\n\nThe purpose in sharing the exhausting, and often consuming, chemical psychotropic medication cycle that affected my reality is to highlight the consequences of mechanically prescribing psychotropic medications, such as Risperidone, and the associated, and often disconcerting symptoms patients experience when these medications are changed or discontinued. Ill advised, I found myself running from one medication to another with the development of each new and troubling symptom contributing to increased physical and emotional discord. My quest for answers was frantic as my body and mind failed me. To my detriment, this franticness was witnessed by the prescribing psychiatrist and a host of other healthcare professionals leaving a permanent impression of madness that is not easily erased.\n\nListening to CBC radio and reviewing this conversation online provided links to numerous studies conducted and documented by reputable sources confirming my initial belief that many of the physical and psychological symptoms I endured over a 5 year period were primarily from psychotropic medication dosage changes, switching from one medication to another, discontinuing these medications completely and the painful emotions from having many of my concerns dismissed with condescension and evident irritability within a small healthcare community. I would find myself being labeled as a difficult patient and diagnosed with numerous psychiatric syndromes I had never been associated with in the past.\n\nI have a history of an eating disorder decades ago and received treatment at the Toronto General Hospital for 14 weeks beginning in January 1988. I experienced decreased, yet intermittent binging after receiving care at Toronto General Hospital. I found myself moving to a smaller city to be closer to my distant father in September 2003 and obtained an unreliable casual cashier position at a local hardware store. I arrived with a small supply of the antidepressant Prozac and considered discontinuing this medication when the supply was exhausted. My attempt to discontinue Prozac was unsuccessful and I was referred to a psychiatrist in March 2004.\n\nThe prescribing psychiatrist has a private psychiatric practice with full privileges at the local hospital, staffs an outpatient rapid response clinic and is also a clinical assistant professor specializing in mood and anxiety disorders at a reputable university typicalling seeing approximately 700 patients per year since 1997. These credentials suggest a mental health care professional with significant knowledge of the vast and diverse psychotropic medications he prescribes to hundreds of his patients on day to day basis.\n\nI was prescribed a different antidepressant in March 2004 that was later determined ineffective and replaced with the familiar Prozac in August 2004. I was then prescribed Risperidone in September 2004 to augment the Prozac for depression. I was not aware that benefits of Prozac required time to be achieved. I returned to this psychiatrists office requesting higher and higher doses of Risperidone on three separate occasions specifically for this medications sedating properties and I was never advised of the potential irreversible side effects of Risperidone and the difficulty discontinuing this medication when this medication was first initiated and with each subsequent requested dosage increase. \n\nLiterature reports that many patients will not experience the full benefit of antidepressants therapy immediately and the benefits may take as long as 8 weeks. Perhaps Risperidone would never have been prescribed had I waited the course till the full benefits of Prozac therapy were achieved; and, conceivably, I could still be taking Prozac today. \n\nI addressed my concerns about taking Risperidone with the prescribing psychiatrist in April 2008 when I discovered this medication was utilized as a chemical restraint in the elderly population with dementia often presenting with difficult behaviours. I did not want to take Risperidone after this discovery yet believed the prescribing psychiatrist--a paternal-like figure--must know best. I was both shy and timid when addressing my concerns about taking Risperidone only to end up being in agreement with current psychotropics or advised to trial another antipsychotic such as Invega. I opted not to trial Invega. I felt the onus of seeking alternatives to Risperidone fall upon my shoulders and my role in health care was insignificant when compared to the role of psychiatrist. I felt very unsupported.\n\nA typical prescription would read Prozac 80-120mg and Risperdal 2-4mg or simply Prozac 120mg and Risperdal 4mg. The prescribing psychiatrist documented that I often reduced both medications and, at one time, reduced the Prozac dosage as low a 20mg documenting relapse without ever investigating the purpose of my non-compliance. In addition, my medical charts reveal that a pharmacy had contacted the prescribing psychiatrist asking if they should fill an expired prescription for Risperidone and Prozac as I had reported having accumulated a surplus of medication. The prescription was filled and the prescriber made no inquiry into the surplus or stockpile of medication I had acquired or the notion of noncompliance. This lack of inquiry hindered the development of a therapeutic relationship that was never really initiated. \n\nThe antipsychotic medications began to change in late 2012: from Risperidone to Quetiapine, back to Risperidone *and* Quetiapine, to Trazodone, to Trazodone and Quetiapine and this chemical psychotropic medication cycle would continue to negatively affect my physical and psychological wellness in such profound ways leading me to believe that other psychotropic medications were ineffective contributing to increased medication changes perpetuating physical harm and psychological chaos for several years to follow. Unbeknownst to me, I would begin an era fraught with somatic symptoms including increased body pain query fibromyalgia, fatigue, skin rashes, gastrointestinal issues query irritable bowel syndrome, nausea, numbness and tingling, cognitive decline, increased anxiety (GAD), ADHD, fatigue and insomnia coupled with numerous psychiatric labels that I can not seem to escape. The newly acquired psychiatric labels assigned to me based upon the symptoms I presented with were perhaps the most harmful and destructive eroding my self- esteem and self-confidence in tasks that I had become proficient in.\n\nInsomnia developed when Quetiapine replaced Risperidone and I began to struggle with the demands of shift work where I was required to work within a team environment in a role to care for others. I would later return to the more powerful Risperidone. The prescribing psychiatrist documents in my medical charts that I did not find the Seroquel as helpful as the Risperdal, and decided to go back on the Risperdal, in addition to continuing on the Seroquel. She was aware of the increased risk of TD \\[Tardive Dyskinesia\\] by making the decision to go back on the Risperdal, in comparison to remaining solely on Seroquel. The irony in this statement is that I would not have found myself in that uncomfortable predicament of having to choose between one antipsychotic over another antipsychotic--Risperidone or Seroquel--had the prescribing psychiatrist obtained valid informed consent when the medication was initiated in September 2004. I propose this example of thorough documentation of informed consent is to avoid blame or responsibility for the prescribing psychiatrists failure to obtain informed consent when initially prescribing Risperidone and with subsequent dosage increases in the past.\n\nIn addition, I had to have older breast implants removed at the hospital I was employed at in 2013 and anticipated discontinuing Risperidone close to the surgery date. I was quite content with my body image in my early 50s and opted for a simple explantation without additional cosmetic surgery and I had established very satisfying and financially rewarding employment allowing me to reduce my mortgage significantly.\n\nThe unexpected and coincidental removal of ruptured and encapsulated silicone breast implants in 2013 coupled with the current-day controversy surrounding silicone breast implants at that time contributed to an even greater sense of confusion within me as I began to experience the host of challenging physical and psychological symptoms . There is a specific group of individuals consisting primarily or women who believe that silicone breast implants and silicone products are harmful and contribute to numerous physical and psychological health concerns including breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma. \n\nI knew enough to recognize the onset of the symptoms I experienced presented quickly but I could not determine if the symptoms were from psychotropic medication changes, psychotropic medication discontinuation or from 28 year old ruptured silicone breast implants. I was confused and with increased anxiety I asked the prescribing psychiatrist if any of my pain could be contributed to various psychotropic medications and their corresponding changes. His response was Not to my knowledge. There is sufficient documentation regarding the onset of the physical and psychological symptoms experienced in my medical notes from my local walk-in medical clinic; a medical clinic that would abruptly dismiss my concerns only to discover that genuine health concerns existed. I vividly recall a physician in this medical clinic, with great annoyance, attempt to convince me that I had a complex chronic disease by utilizing a tick-in-the-box symptom checker sheet.\n\nLoss of respect and faith in this medical clinic eventually replaced the painful feelings of being identified as a difficult and undesirable patient. \n\nMy coping skills diminished quickly with the numerous psychotropic medication changes originating from a conscious and documented attempt to discontinue Risperidone in 2012 leading me to believe that the Prozac I had taken since the late 1998 was no longer effective. I inquired about the efficacy of Prozac when taken for extended periods of time and the prescriber psychiatrist could not comment so I requested to switch to another antidepressant in April 2014. My ability to concentrate at work declined significantly as I began to soil myself with increasing frequency and I felt I had to transfer from an acute care position consisting of shiftwork that I truly loved to a disappointing and unsupportive part time position is residential care due to the unpredictability of my bowels. I was overwhelmed when, to use medical terminology, I was incontinent of a large loose, liquid BM in Walmart. This fecal incontinence affected my ability to manage at work and in daily life and I sought more frequent psychiatric counsel. The prescribing psychiatrist was unable to connect the increased loose fecal incontinence I experienced with the medication he prescribed in April 2014 until late August 2014. The prescribing psychiatrist suggested I consider the plant-based Vegan diet and implied that the aging process may be contributing to my physical symptoms. These symptoms exacerbated any mood disorder I may have had contributing to increased anxiety, depression and isolation coupled with feelings complete helplessness.\n\nThe prescribing psychiatrist did not consider a differential diagnosis and review the various psychotropic medication changes prescribed, beginning with Risperidone, as potential sources to the numerous side effects presented. I would learn years later that the medication causing fecal incontinence prescribed in April 2014 had been prescribed and deemed ineffective a decade earlier in 2004 and the prescribing psychiatrist neglected to refer to my medical charts when inadvertently re-prescribing this medication for a second time. \n\nI was very afraid as my mind and body began to fail me. The physical and psychological symptoms escalated and I called 811 in August 2014 and was advised to go to the emergency department in the hospital where I work. Emergency physicians often refer to a medication databank listing the patients dispensed medications to develop an understanding into the patients medical history and to gain potential insight into the cause of patients primary complaint leading to an emergency visit. My medication databank (Pharmanet) listed numerous and various psychotropic medications dispensed over several months and I was hurt to hear the emergency physician state that I was wasting his time during this isolated visit in August 2014. Thoughtless and disparaging comments and attitudes towards individuals with mental illness are common in the healthcare profession; a profession that should display more tolerance towards individuals with mental illness. Individuals holding positions of authority in healthcare should choose to be positive role models for others and lead by example. The emergency physicians statement clearly implied I was a burden and this notion would be reinforced by health care professionals in my community for years to come serving to exacerbate any struggles I may have had with depression and anxiety.\n\nI have been privy to many conversations regarding challenging patients and I regretfully admit to participating in some of these conversations. I distinctly recall caring for two women known throughout the healthcare facility as being demanding and unreasonable and it became difficult for me to care for them burdened with the notion that I too, could be one them. To my surprise, one of these women was transferred to the local hospice facility for end-of-life care and I felt a sense of guilt as I watched her mobilize to the hospice dinner table.\n\nI terminated my relationship with the prescribing psychiatrist of 10 years, from March 2004 to September 2014, and received chastising comments for my actions from my GP at the time. My GPs disapproval instilled feelings of guilt and the need for me to make amends by sending a 2014 Christmas card to the prescribing psychiatrist.\n\nI would connect with a new psychiatrist December 2014 and she suggested the mainstay of treatment should be psychotherapeutic in nature describing the purpose of this treatment format and how I would benefit from such treatment. I am saddened to read of the individual I had become as described in the new initial psychiatric assessment in December 2014. The negative experiences from psychotropic medication changes, discontinuing psychotropic medication and with healthcare professionals contributed to feeling like she is constantly being judged...she is afraid of being humiliated by others...she struggles with feeling like a fraud and that they can see her dysfunction...and is worried that her co-workers can see it in her. In addition, this initial consult reports chronic pain in her arms, shoulders, chest, through her legs for the last year and a half and has seen doctors who believe it might be fibromyalgia...there are chronic gastrointestinal symptoms with a possible diagnosis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome...her thought content was significant for decreased self-worth and she spoke about herself with quite disgust and shame.\n\nI had finally discontinued all psychotropic medications with the exception of a small dose of Oxazepam for sleep for well over a year when I first listened to this particular CBC White Coat Black Art podcast in May 2018. This podcast and corresponding website providing links to reputable academic sources strongly suggests that pertinent information regarding patient safety and the physical and psychological side effects related to psychotropic medication changes has been known, present and available for decades. I find myself wondering why the prescribing psychiatrist, with all of his credentials, did not consider the various medication changes as the source for the exacerbation of physical and psychiatric symptoms and the onset of new symptoms I presented with. In hindsight, perhaps it is possible that the prescribing psychiatrist did suspect that some of my symptoms were related to psychotropic medication changes when he prescribed Nabilone for pain; he just never articulated his suspicions to me or the healthcare providers at my local walk-in medical clinic.\n\nIn November 2016 I requested my medical notes from the psychiatrist who initiated the course of Risperidone more than twelve years ago with the intent of complaining to the College of Physicians and Surgeons after caring for an elderly woman who was prescribed levodopa/carbidopa three times a day. Many patients are prescribed levodopa/carbidopa yet there was no mention of this woman having Parkinsons disease during shift report. It was discovered this woman presented with Parkinsonian symptoms as a result of taking Olanzapine for several decades. I could be this woman 20 years from now. This woman was later diagnosed with Stickmans Disease by the local neurologist.\n\nI continued to struggle with the physical and psychological symptoms that began when I attempted to discontinue Risperidone in 2012. I had been diagnosed with ADHD the previous year and the physical and psychological symptoms persisted affecting my ability to focus and concentrate contributing to feelings of increased confusion and self-doubt. Equally disabling is the the ADHD diagnosis/label itself. I now understand that I have lived with the same brain my whole life but I became fearful of ADHDs presence with increased incidents of forgetfulness when racing thoughts regarding my failing mind and body would interrupt the continuity of complicated processes of established learned skill-sets and well laid plans. I began to identify strongly with the geriatric population and considered the possibility of dementia.\n\nIn addition, I recently discovered I had renal health concerns during this time period learning that my kidneys were allergic to Hydrochlorothiazide. I developed hypertension during this era of psychotropic medication changes and I was having an adverse reaction to this medication. I began to experience neurological twitching in my fingers, increased numbness and tingling coupled with flank pain and my GP abruptly dismissed me without listening to my concerns stating I had somatoform disorder because I had a history of an eating disorder decades ago.\n\nPerhaps one of the most humiliating experiences was returning to the emergency room in the hospital where I was employed--for a second time--to describe these symptoms noted above and to state with transparency that these symptoms, as per my GP, were symptoms of somatoform disorder. I was referred to a nephrologist who identified a legitimate health concern and who would soon adopt the same attitude as my GP. I became a renal patient that day.\n\nWith my medical notes obtained November 2016, I submitted a formal written complaint to the College of Physicians and Surgeons in February 2017 regarding the psychiatric care received and this complaint went unheeded. I received the psychiatrists response to my initial complaint after June 28, 2017, and the content of his response confirmed:\n\n* I was only provided with my transcribed medical charts and not given the handwritten medical charts when I requested my medical files in November 2016.\n* The prescribing psychiatrist did not refer to my medical charts when inadvertently re-prescribing an ineffective medication for a second time in April 2014.\n\nReceipt of my handwritten medical charts in July 2017 reveal and support the notion that valid informed consent was never obtained or documented until April 2008 confirming my original query to the College of Physicians and Surgeons when I inquired Why wouldnt \\[the prescribing psychiatrist\\] discuss the side effects with me when I began taking Risperidone when he first prescribed the medication to me?\n\nI was emotionally scattered after receiving the prescribing psychiatrists response and had recently been approved for long-term disability through my employer benefit package. A series of negative interactions with healthcare professionals accelerated my determination to discontinue all psychotropic medications at this time. It was unsettling to observe a rheumatologist google the results of a pathology report of a recent skin biopsy after waiting months to see her and it was equally unsettling to have to request new bloodwork when a second nephrologist made reference to lab values from six months ago during a 6-month consult. This same nephrologist would document that I had discontinued all my medications with exception of oxazepam underscoring my sense of madness. This nephrologist ordered new bloodwork, at my request, stating that a renal biopsy may be ordered if proteinuria and hematuria were present--and they were. I considered relocating to a larger city to receive healthcare realizing that all future health concerns would be met with familiar disdain within the small community I resided in. \n\nI believed the continual proteinuria and hematuria was contributing to the physical symptoms I presented with and sought healthcare at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, November 2017. My humble and pitiful admission of traveling to the Mayo Clinic indicates the continued presence of physical and psychological symptoms months after discontinuing psychotropic medications and my own vulnerable and determined quest for answers knowing that the symptoms I presented with began within a specific time frame. The distinct stigma towards individuals with mental illness that I experienced in my hometown was all too prevalent at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona. My body was changing and declining in so many ways and I felt helpless and isolated.\n\nI overlooked the advisement of the College of Physicians and Surgeons to provide any new facts to be of particular significance to the issues at hand regarding my complaint about the psychiatric care I received for over a decade after receipt of the prescribing psychiatrists response to my initial letter of complaint and inbetween obtaining the other half of my medical chart. In addition, issues regarding abnormal lab values, disdainful healthcare professional attitudes, discontinuing medications and entertaining the idea of moving to a larger city also contributed to the oversight of the Colleges advisement. I could see the inconsistencies in the psychiatric care I received but did not possess the means to articulate these inconsistencies with appropriate medical and legal language nor could I present them in a timely manner. I am a team on one with limited time and resources.\n\nThe timing of listening to this academic conversation on CBCs White Coat Black Art addressing and discussing the physical and psychological side effects individuals often experience from discontinuing an array of psychotropic medications on May 11, 2018 could not have presented at a more opportune time: I was taking a lunch break from writing a Statement of Points to the Health Professions Review Board, at a local library in Vancouver, regarding the complaint I made to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia concerning the care I received from the prescribing physician over the course of 10 years when I first listened to this podcast. \n\nI believed the content of this CBC White Coat Black Art podcast so significant that I included the link to this podcast with subsequent links to When it comes to antidepressants, getting to zero proves difficult by Dr. Goldman, Many People taking Antidepressants Discover They Cannot Quit by Benedict Carey and Robert Gebeloff of The New York Times, and Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome by C. Warner and colleagues, in my Statement of Points to the Health Professions Review Board. I naively believed the Health Professions Review Board Panel would take the time to listen and consider the well researched and documented content of this CBC podcast that succinctly explains the source of the physical and psychological symptoms I endured for several years: symptoms related to antipsychotic and psychotropic medications.\n\nThe Health Professions Review Board decision favoured the initial psychiatrist and reported that the documents I submitted demonstrates that the Complainant is not a reliable historian and that she has demonstrated an unwillingness to accept a diagnosis or treatment that does not accord with her own view of her medical conditions as she understands them. \n\nMedical research and documentation relegated to medical textbooks in university and hospital libraries are now available online and it makes sense that I would search for corroborating medical knowledge to confirm that I endured numerous physical and psychological side effects resulting from psychotropic medication changes. The evident holes in my medical charts reveal that informed consent was not obtained until I had become reliant on this medications sedating properties. Online research will continue as the well-known adverse effects from antipsychotic and antidepressant medications are now openly revealed and discussed on public platforms including radio and television in addition to internet sources. To reiterate: I naively declared in my initial complaint to the College of Physicians and Surgeons that I began to experience many uncomfortable physical and emotional symptoms coinciding with a conscious attempt to discontinue Risperidone in 2012. These side effects were validated when listening to CBC and researching the numerous sources cited.\n\nMy original declaration was made without having obtained all my medical documentation and receipt of this documentation would confirm that I was not made aware of the irreversible side effects and difficulting discontinuing Risperidone when this medication was initially and subsequently prescribed until I addressed the issue of the inappropriate use of Risperidone as a chemical restraint in the elderly population in 2008. The Panel Chairs response to my review request minimizes the physical and psychological symptoms I experienced when attempting to discontinue Risperidone and the chemical psychotropic medication cycle perpetuated from this event for several years to follow. In addition, this response explicitly implies that the symptoms I experienced are a result of my own negligence placing the fault upon the psychiatric patient.\n\nThe personal nature of psychiatric treatment suggests that psychiatric patients are often emotionally and/or intellectually unstable and unreliable historians creating invisible barriers hindering the vulnerable psychiatric patients ability to complain effectively about psychiatric care they have received. The invisible barriers intimidate, discourage and prevent the psychiatric patient from submitting formal complaints against the psychiatric healthcare provider to appropriate governing bodies who dismiss their concerns favouring the psychiatric practitioner.\n\nI did not possess all the essential medical and legal language when formalizing my complaints to these governing bodies and their responses simply reiterate my mental illness history based upon the psychiatrists documentation stating I am an inaccurate historian rather than acknowledge that: \n\n* I was not provided with half of my medical chart essential to ensure greater accuracy in describing the historical events in my initial complaint regarding care received over a 10-year period;\n* the withheld medical charts indicates informed consent was not obtained during the first 4 years of care;\n* the prescriber neglected to refer to my medical chart prior to re-prescribing an ineffective psychotropic medication strongly suggesting that he, too, is an inaccurate historian;\n* The combination of numerous psychotropic medication changes, beginning with initial prescription of Risperidone in 2004, followed by numerous attempts to discontinue this medication in 2012 contributed to the numerous physical and psychological symptoms I would experience from years to come; and\n* the prescribing psychiatrist did not acknowledge the onset of exacerbated and unexplained symptoms as a result of psychotropic medication changes.\n\nAddressing my concerns to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia and extending my complaint further to the Health Professions Review Board were ineffective. On August 3, 2017, I registered a Petition to the Court in the Supreme Court of British Columbia to set aside decisions made my the Health Professions Review Board and The College of Physicians and Surgeons with the intent of remitting the matter back to the College of Physicians and Surgeons. I have enclosed a copy of the Petition to the Court for your perusal.\n\nThe barriers I experienced in registering this Petition were many and its contents may appear simple, naive, and lacking in both legal and medical expertise.\n\nI have cited and listed the same documentation I had provided electronic links to for the Health Professions Review Board to examine in an affidavit to Petition to the Court from the CBC White Coat Black Art podcast that aired May 11, 2018. Some of the documents cited as evidence affirm that knowledge of the physical and psychological symptoms attributed to discontinuing antipsychotic and antidepressant medications has been known for decades and should have been acknowledged by the initial prescriber of Risperidone. I would have also cited Dr. Richard Friedmans article A Call for Caution in the Use of Antipsychotic Drugs had I been permitted to submit additional documentation.\n\nI exercise respect when stating that I am not physician, a psychiatrist or a lawyer. I am an individual, a middle-aged woman, a caregiver, and a patient with a history of mental illness who encountered numerous obstacles and barriers necessitating tenacity in attempting to access the legal system independently when others would simply submit and accept to living with the same conditions believing themselves powerless, feeling voiceless and invisible. \n\nThe dismissive, and often humiliating, incidents I experienced from healthcare professionals occuring while under the care of the initial prescribing psychiatrist continued even after ending this patient/psychiatrist relationship. These incidents are not the primary issue in my legal suit requesting the Supreme Court of British Columbia to quash the Health Professions Review Board and College of Physicians and Surgeons decisions in favour of the initial psychiatrist; rather, these incidents were a manifestation of preconceived notions and stigmatic beliefs towards individuals with mental illness attempting to reclaim their mental wellness and serve to underscore the necessity for transparency between psychiatrist and patient. There is a defined series of events that transpired when I attempted to discontinue Risperidone in late 2012: a\n\nmedication I continued to request higher doses of without being informed of the potential irreversible side effects and the difficulting in discontinuing this medication. These events continued to undermine any legitimate health concerns I presented with in the small city I resided in and have affected the care and a diagnosis I received from a healthcare practitioner in the metropolis I currently reside in. It is fortunate that I acquire a GP here who is both an academic and a scientist. Dare I say, these events may not have occurred had I been given sufficient information to make an informed choice about the nature of Risperidone in 2004 when this medication was quickly prescribed in the final minutes of a 30 minute consult. \n\nI suspect that the initial prescribing psychiatrist recognized that the harm of his actions, or lack of actions, would require significant explanation and psychiatric care reflecting poorly upon him and his position in authority within a small healthcare community. In addition, it was less problematic for him, and perhaps somewhat of a relief, when I sought alternative mental healthcare after losing faith in his abilities.\n\nThe difficulty I experienced discontinuing Risperidone and subsequent psychotropic medications mirrors similar difficulties other patients have experienced exemplifying the Elephant in the Room idiom: The difficulty discontinuing psychotropic medications, including the powerful Risperidone, is an undesirable fact that remained unaddressed and ignored until reputable sources such as CBC and The New York Times presented this serious problem identifying the physical and emotional symptoms patients have experienced and their vain attempts to discontinue these medications only to experience failure and to have these symptoms attributed to their declining mental illness. I believe I have a legitimate complaint regarding the psychiatric care I received from 2004-2014 in that the prescribing psychiatrist and university professor had an understanding that I was physically and psychologically struggling to discontinue Risperidone and various psychotropic medications trialled when he prescribed Nabilone for pain. Prescribing a medication without obtaining informed consent and re-prescribing an ineffective medication in error only compounds the harm done by not identifying the disturbing symptoms I began to experience in 2012 when I attempted to discontinue Risperidone. \n\nRelocating to a larger city for healthcare has revealed that I have thin basement membrane disease, a renal aneurysm and a grade 2 rectocele in a relatively kind, emotionally safe and patient medical environment. Food has not been an issue for several years and this fact, in isolation, is emancipating. I take less analgesic and continue to live with intermittent pain, headaches, GI concerns and hypertension coupled with numbness and tingling that began during my journey. I struggle at times with a misaligned circadian rhythm and my sleep quality, for the most part, is moderate and I have been advised not to work nights shifts again. I long to be able to take that satisfying and re-energizing 20 minute midday nap that has been unattainable since discontinuing psychotropic medication well over a year ago. My cognition has evolved and matured since my initial complaint to the College in February 2017 regarding the psychiatric care I received for more than a decade and I can define my concerns with greater clarity.\n\nI recognize and even expect that my description of events may be, yet again, dismissed as a result of mental illness contributing to medical, scientific or unkind comments regarding my emotional demeanor. After all, I am a psychiatric patient and psychiatric patients are poor historians.\n\nThe issues of mechanically prescribing powerful psychotropic medications, such as Risperidone, without providing adequate medication information in a manner easily understood by patients, medical complacency in continuous prescribing of large doses of psychotropic medications without inquiring into the patients logic and reasoning for their non-compliance, re-prescribing ineffective psychotropic medication without referring to a patients medication history and not identifying and associating the onset of increased or new symptoms with psychotropic medication changes need to be addressed in a medical culture that often corrects emotional maladies with a pill. \n\nMy mental health history clearly indicates the desire to discontinue the psychotropic medication Risperidone and I was prescribed this medication without appropriate medication information. These facts coupled with experiencing the onset and continuation of very uncomfortable physical and psychological symptoms when attempting to discontinue Risperidone with insufficient support was both socially and medically undermining marking the beginning of sad and stressful chapter in my life that I look forward to closing. Resiliency should not be this difficult.\n\nIn conclusion, this journey has been one of isolation coupled with fears of being ostracized for burdening others with my concerns and linked hand-in-hand with suggestions and explicit statements that I was a burden, a waste of time, while attempting to have some of the physical and psychological symptoms I experienced from psychotropic medication changes addressed. I simply state that my journey has consisted of a series of experiences that have negatively impacted my physical and psychological well-being. I am apprehensive, yet clearly in need of returning to meaningful employment. My thoughts are more clear and I recognize I have been provided with the gift of time and the opportunity to share my concerns with you and to register these concerns with the Supreme Court of British Columbia. As mentioned previously, the tone of this letter is written calmly and is meant to be read and interpreted in this manner and I hope to maintain this demeanour when I present to the Supreme Court.\n\nI have encountered many individuals who feel this endeavour will fail; however, the attempt has been made, the concerns addressed and the event recorded for others to follow as the inconvenient truths about psychotropic medications are revealed.\n\nI am presently unsure of how to reestablish a life with purpose and self-worth and trust I will continue to recognize and acknowledge unexpected events as opportunities to reclaim my mental wellness in a new journey towards self-discovery.'"

I have a deviated septum from breaking my nose when I was a teenager. He *thinks* this *could* be the cause of my headaches since the bones in my nose were shifted over to the left and the ""pressure"" (and pain from the headaches) is consistently above my left eye. ***However***, he said the corrective surgery is a ""50/50 shot"" for helping with the headaches, which is a joke to me....I\'m not going to have a surgery if the odds are not better than 50/50! Really quite disappointed in how inconclusive and wishy-washy this doctor was. He even looked at the MRI and CT Scans, and that\'s the best he could do. \n\n**Update 3:** I\'ve noticed that **eating seems to be a headache trigger** for me, but as of yet I can\'t identify what food/s.

So Ive been sick now for 7 years. I was initially diagnosed with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue, but my symptoms are so severe and have continued to get worse, to the point where I cant even sit up in bed some days. \n\nWe finally thought wed found an answer after a bunch of seemingly heart-related symptoms popped up, but my echo just came back completely normal. There was a nonspecific anomaly on my ECG, but the doctor didnt seemed worried about it.\n\nSYMPTOMS: First presenting symptoms were fatigue, severe muscle and joint pain-worst in my chest, neck, lower back, lower legs, wrists and hips, some neurological difficulty like forgetting words, and feeling overall less sharp in my mind, severe heartburn, dysphagia, and alopecia (clusters, not overall thinning). These symptoms all developed over the course of about 2 weeks, 7 years ago, and have been present since.\n\nThe new symptoms Ive developed are a severe shortness of breath, heart murmur, pulsatile tinnitus, and pitting edema in my legs from the knee down.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Recreational drug and alcohol use, and a 2 year struggle with opioid and benzodiazepine addiction. Fully sober from drugs for 1 year (aside from methadone maintenance), sober from alcohol for 5 years.\nI vape about 15mg/day of nicotine. Im obese. \n\nFAMILY HISTORY: A lot of cancer on both sides, addiction and depression on fathers side.\n\nTESTS/SPECIALISTS: Ive seen a rheumatologist who ruled out auto-immune. I was tested for lupus and overall inflammation and results were normal. Heart, lung, liver and kidney function is normal. Blood panel was normal. No HIV, Hep C, STIs, diabetes. Thyroid normal.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Methadone (35mg q day), Mirtazipine (15mg q night), pantoprazole 40mg q day), Gabapentin (600mg q 4hrs)\n\nThats about all the information I can think of. Its incredibly frustrating spending my life bedridden unable to properly care for myself, and not knowing why. Any help would be an incredible gift. Thank you.'"

gabapentin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/hmao7o/pain_in_side_of_head_affecting_quality_of_life/,b'Pain in side of head affecting quality of life and out of ideas..',,"b'^(A new account for sake of privacy.) \n\nI\'ve been experiencing a pain in the left-side of my head that has continued to get worse over time. As well as a experiencing a pain, I often get other symptoms such as a high tempertature across my head, specifically the ears and cheeks as these get hot to touch - on both sides too, not just the left-side of my face. \n\n^(To hopefully help with reading, I\'m from the UK...)\n\nMy story is a bit of a long one, one that started 3 or 4 years ago with a ""tingle"" across my upper teeth which I really noticed towards the end of a working day, such as being in a late in the day meeting or maybe driving home. I would often feel tired at these times too, however I would get home and feel okay again, I put this down to maybe the office environment I was in or just my food and/or caffiene intake towards the end of a day. My first port of call was to visit a Dentist after riding out my odd symptoms for some months. I\'ve since visited, some on more than once occasion, a Dentist, Endodontist, Chiropractor, General Practitioner, Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeon, Ear Nose Throat, Neurology and now back in the hands of my GP, looking at possibly being passed to a ""Local Pain Service"" which from my understanding is the end of the road e.g. we can\'t find the source so we\'ll treat the pain from here on. \n\nI just wish someone would find the cause, I\'m not even worried about a solution at the moment. Although things have worsened over time, especially the last year I\'d say, a signifcant treatment was a Root Canal that I had undergone on my upper-left 1st molar (if I\'m right in saying that my wisdom is the 3rd molar), this is where the Endodontist came in. It was extremely tender after the treatment and it never got better. I was actually referred to the Endodontist by my regular Dentist as they couldn\'t see a problem with a tooth, however, after having a scan on a more premium-like device, the Endodontist was able to see that I needed a Root Canal (deeply filled is my understanding). Back and forth I went with the Endodontist but they couldn\'t see anything. My Dentist also couldn\'t see anything and noted that my wisdom teeth were not impacted in any way, they appear fine and I apparently manage to clean them well. My Dentist also checked for Temporomandibular disorder by pushing his thumb into the left-side of my mouth, presumably pushing on a jaw muscle, and asked if it hurt. I could only think it just felt like a full-grown man pushing his thumb into my jaw, but nothing notably painful about it. I met resistance with the Dentist and Endodontist so I went back to my GP. \n\nMy GP gave me a nasal spray. I\'ve complained throughout my past that my nose is very blocked but I\'ve been told my nasal passage is clear, and because of this I\'ve been prescribed many different nasal sprays which never seemed to work. I can\'t blame the GP for trying another one but I was again frustrated. I paid to see a Oral & Maxillofacial specialist who took an xray and assessed my syptoms, coming to the conclusion that I should have a CT scan, to which I accepted. Back at my local hospital, I had the CT scan which concluded I have a cyst in my right maxillary sinus, small enough to not be of concern following feedback from ENT.  ENT passed me to Neurology who said I should be passed back to ENT as the neuropathic medication they prescribed me weren\'t effective. At the time of writing I am taking Gabapentin which is just making me feel sleepy, if anything. \n\nA last spurt of information.. I get clicks and ""crunches"" when yawning wide, or even moving my jaw from left to right in an unnatural movement. I often feel like there\'s a subtle similar pain above my upper-right molars too, again it feels like the wisdom. I can\'t 100% attribute the pain to any tooth but I\'ve consistenly described how there\'s a feeling of pressure, much like when I had an abscess once but was able to drain it which relieved the pressure - this resulted in a molar removal in my bottom-left side. I have no problem eating, if anything it can relieve the pain I have for that time. I just can\'t concentrate on things, I feel a litte bit sick sometimes and it\'s really affected my mood over time. Oh, and hangovers are horrendous as the dominant pain in the left-side of my head is amplified massively the next morning, I can\'t explain how bad that is and I\'ve put myself off socialising with alchohol at times because of it! \n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated. I\'m sorry for how much I\'ve wrote, I\'m sure I could publish it in hardback one day but I\'m really just looking for hope that some way or another I\'ll be able to at least manage whatever it is that is going on...'"

I realise there is not a lot of data connecting effexor and acne (hence why I didnt suspect it was the cause), which is why I decided to post this in case some one else may be having a similar experience. Naturally, your mental health would probably be more important to you than having clear skin (Although if you are like me the two things are correlated), and not everyone is going to have the same side effects from a drug (as I said, the aggregate data from people taking this drug has not identified that breakouts are a common side effect), so this anecdote may be immaterial to you.

Our attending is out of ideas. Consults arent leading anywhere. Hence posting here, hoping for some insights from more knowledgeable peeps.\n\nNote: u/rabiaplus is on same care team.\n\nOur patient is a 60 year old female with Hx of DVT (on warfarin for 6 years) and RA for over 15 years and has been on several monoclonal antibodies mostly because her joint pain was not relieved. During this time she has b/l knees and hips replaced. All other joints are doing well. \nShe was hospitalized 5 months ago for Acute on chronic renal failure needing HD for the first time. Her kidney biopsy showed amyloidosis likely 2/2 to her RA.  Since her initial hospitalization she has been in ICU for the third time. First two admissions were becasue she could not tolerate HD on regular in-patient floor, her MAPs would drop to 30s. Recently she had Cdiff, HI PNA and bacteremia, as well as  aspiration PNA requiring antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn), she is now off Bipap, however, still quite weak. Continues to stay on TF. \n\nADDED:\nShe has been on consistent dose of 25 mg prednisone for past 3 or 4 months.\n\nOverall, the main issue holding her in ICU is her hypotension. She has been on CRRT and not been able to come off levophed for over a month. Just like her previous ICU transfers she is not able to tolerate HD. Her MAPs drops in 30s. Also, her hypotension is constant not just HD related or postural. She has been on midodrine 20 mg  TID. Her echo is Normal EF 65%, no VHD or diastolic dysfunction. Very low suspicion that she has cardiac amyloidosis (this has not been confirmed with any biopsy or cardiac MRI considering her current condition) \n\nJust another piece that may not be be relevant  to my main question, but sharing to give the whole picture: Her WBC count has been consistently high in 25 to 35s, no fevers, normal procal and inflammatory markers. She has completed her Vanc for C diff , linezolid for VRE UTI and zosyn for HI PNA and  bacteremia for sometime. A wbc scan was done to look for any focus of inflammation, but was completely benign. \n\nADDED: We think patient is over the big hump of fighting infections, and acute management of BP stabilization. We are now planning for a safe transfer to floor. What can we do so that she is not Levo dependent and able to tolerate regular HDs? For example, today we tried HD after being on CRRT for a month. During that period, she was on levo 6 and her MAPs drop to 30s again. We ended up giving her fluid to bring her BP up\n\nBig question: what are our options for treating or managing her hypotension? (No longer the big question, kindly scroll down for most recent updates)\n\nMay 29 Update:\n* Family has finally agreed and Palliative is now on board (declined palliative before).\n* Pts MAPS are 55 to 65 now (improved from 30 to 40, two days ago without any change in treatment).\n* Pt is fully conscious, lively and engaged in the last 24 hrs: solving puzzles, little bit of painting, writing, and holding conversations with family.\n* Pt is trying her best to work with PT team (exercises in bed), plan is to sit her up in chair soon. \n* As of now the family/patient both desire full aggressive care.\n* Pt has been on high dose prednisone and hydrocortisone daily for adrenal insufficiency \n* Amyloidosis and MM lab work up negative \n* Pocus/ bedside echo now showing pt is developing diastolic dysfunction/ HFeEF and MS (unfortunately now done during HD)\n* Formal Echo was normal last week, even MS was not mentioned.\n\nJune 06 Update:\n\nPt seems to be tolerating HD better now, and only occasionally requires a low dose of levo during dialysis. Shes is being given midrodrine and albumin prior to HD to keep the BP up. (Pt has been off CRRT). HD sessions observations:\n\n* May 27 - HD 2 hrs - with levo, BP normal\n\n* May 28 - HD 2 hrs - w/o levo, BP dropped slightly\n\n* May 29 - HD skipped\n\n* May 30 - HD 2 hrs - w/o levo, tolerated 2 litres of fluid removal, bp dropped very slightly\n\n* June 1 - HD 2 hrs - blood pressure dropped slightly after 30 min, so levo was administered\n\n* June 02 - HD skipped\n\n* June 3 - HD 3 hours, 500 mL removed, albumin and midodrine were given prior to session. Levo not needed\n\n* June 4 - no HD (legs more physically swollen, right leg more swollen /tighter and left arm more swollen), SOB, crackly lung , fatigue , reported feeling anxious at night\n\n* June 5 - HD 3.5 hours, 1000 ml net fluid removed.

I apologize in advance for the long-winded story, but I feel like if anyone understands and sympathises, it's people from this community.\n\nFirst and foremost, I'm currently pregnant - 27 weeks, but pregnancy did not cause my sciatic pain - I wish. Back in March 2020 I deadlifted too heavy and hurt my lower back (was in a lot of pain for about 2 weeks - but only in lower back). It fixed itself somewhat; meaning I was able to continue working out, but some positions caused a bit of right leg pain. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn December (when I was already about 20 weeks pregnant) I decided to do some Pilates, and after that, the pain started to travel down my right leg - sitting was uncomfortable, and standing up after sitting caused some shooting pains. Nothing too bad, and walking made it better. However, the pain started to get worse and worse, despite me still being active. I started getting some pain in the middle of the night when I would wake up to use the bathroom - going back to bed after that was uncomfortable - I had a hard time finding a position where it wouldn't hurt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to finally being able to see a neurologist in January, who pretty quickly said (after doing the straight leg test and a quick examination) it was L5 radiculopathy (aka sciatica), and suggested that I might try water aerobics, and I probably wouldn't get any relief from PT. She also suggested that I already stay home from work and just try to take it easy. I followed her instructions - I'm currently on my sick leave and won't have to go back to work for a long time (perks of living in Europe). Around January 18th, I also decided to go try water aerobics. Now this is where it got *real.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring the aerobics I felt fine, but the day after - oh boy... I have never felt pain like that in my entire life. It hurts *constantly*. Walking is painful (or any kind of pressure on my leg), laying down is painful (I only have one very specific position where I'm somewhat pain-free), turning around while laying down is the worst, coughing/sneezing is horrible, turning my body is painful - in short, *everything* hurts, and it's so bad in the morning. I wake up and start my day with tears in my eyes, because it's so bad. The neurologist did prescribe 150mg of Diclac (a NSAID), and it's the only thing that will calm down the pain for about 24 hours. But since I'm pregnant, I can only take it until about 33 weeks (an internal md's advice), and definitely not every day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe internal doc also sent me to get an x-ray (the queues for MRIs are long, and the exposure from an x-ray is safer for the baby as well) to see if anything is so bad that it required emergency surgery. They could see that there is significant narrowing between the L5-S1 vertebrae, but nothing that would warrant surgery while pregnant. I also have been seeing a PT and we've been trying to do light stretching and exercises in a warm pool, but doing them in the water hurts as well. No amount of stretching or moving (I've tried a bunch from youtube PTs) has actually helped with the pain, it just hurts to do them, and it doesn't feel good at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here I am - 27 weeks pregnant (13 weeks!! to go), in horrible pain every day. And I know it's going to get worse as the baby continues to grow and push on my spine as well. Any advice on how to handle the pain? After having the baby, should I push for immediate surgery? I cannot even imagine how it would be like to take care of the baby while being in such tremendous pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone (pregnant or not!) has any advice for me, I'd greatly appreciate it."""

Hope this helps those who are at the end of their rope like I once was.'",,"b'TL;DR Wide variety of treatments, severe depression, lifelong sinus problems.\n\n*disclaimer* Long time lurker, first time posting. Throwaway account for a few personal reasons. While I recognize different treatments work for different people, I believe that I found a fundamental cause of a very common, stubborn, and chronic form of acne, comedones, and inflammation. This is my story of discovery.\n\nTwenty-four year old male having suffered from mild, to moderate, to severe acne on my face over ten years and have never had a clear complexion in all that time until now. I have a fair complexion, sensitive skin, and moderate food/airborne seasonal allergies. Years ago my initial breakouts began in the ""T-zone"" specifically blackheads on and surrounding my nose. The war-zone then expanded to whiteheads and blackheads on my brow, and a malicious mix of cystic acne and whiteheads on my cheeks and jawline. I also broke out behind my ears with large milia-like, hard, non-inflammatory nodules. I am a clean and hygienic person and use fresh towels, one for face only one for body, I wash my sheets and pillow-cases regularly, and do my best to avoid touching my face throughout the day. I was always baffled by my recurring problem and assumed others were misjudging my condition as a biproduct of sloth and uncleanliness. \n\nYears of dermatologist appointments racked up costly bills as well as exposure to extremely powerful medications that I naively took in good faith from a doctor. In truth, my dermatologist was a Rx pusher and his friendly demeanor his effective sales-tool of deception. After having poor results (red flaky skin) with Rx topicals such as benzoyl peroxide, differin, duac and clindamycin, I was routed toward using Rx pills such as Minocycline, Doxycycline, and Tetracycline in conjunction with the topicals. Every time I changed antibiotics my skin improved for a few weeks before rapidly deteriorating into scar-inducing cystic breakouts. \n\nIn 2004 at my dermatologist\'s recommendation went on my first regimen of Accutane. I read the labels and warnings but was assured only a small percentage of patients ever experience these side-effects and that the drug was ""pretty much"" guaranteed to work. That half-hearted promise combined with the fact that every other treatment had failed led me to believe Accutane was to be my salvation. I\'ve known people who truly benefitted from the drug but I want to share how it effected me. Within a few weeks my skin became dry and red, my scalp itchy, my joints ached, my eyes jaundiced and I experienced irregular sleep patterns as well as periods of manic depression. Did I tell anyone? No. Why? I was going to tough it out to FINALLY defeat my acne and the anxiety that came with it. I had regular blood work and was told everything checked out, that my side effects were normal. Anyway, after 5 months of soul-draining exposure to the drug, my skin was worse than before the treatment. The acne coverage was about the same, but my skin was thin and weak, hypersensitive, red, blotchy, and constantly dry.\n\n I went back to my usual regimen of a gentle wash and wallowed in self pity for over a year, never really improving, having ""o.k. days"" and ""terrible weeks"" before my dermatologist recommended a fourth course of antibiotics to prevent further scarring. They failed again. After that I entered my picking phase, where on some primal level I was determined to kill the condition myself if the medications couldnt. The subsequent scarring and lack of progress is still regrettable to this day. So I found myself sitting, slouched and defeated flipping through random magazines in the dermatologist\'s waiting rooms listening to the pages flip-over without reading a word, feeling broken. At that point I would have dunked my face in an acid bath and hid in a cave for a year if I could emerge blemish free but instead was misguided to a regimen far worse. A second round of Accutane. \n\nThis time the dermatologist had concrete numbers for me, 80% success rate for second course users he said. Four months later I found myself standing on a second story balcony with a belt around my neck thinking about how my skin was still going to look pock-marked inflamed, and mangled during an open casket ceremony. I\'m not a religious person, so instead of thanking God, I thank the cheap manufacturing process that caused the belt to snap at the buckle on the way down. It is also important to say that this was undoubtedly the most selfish thing I have ever done. I hit the ground and kneed myself in the jaw. Spitting blood I thought of all the people I would have heart and all the painful questions they\'d be asking, likely to arrive at the wrong conclusion. A few months before I was a witty, engaged and humorous person, aware of my physical eyesores, upset by them, but not self-loathing by any means. Granted on my first course of Accutane I\'d have moments where I felt really down but the magnitude of depression and the destructive, neurotic introspection I experienced during my second course led me to live a quiet secluded life of hermitage and hopelessness. \n\nI haven\'t told anyone I know about this struggle and the severity of my own actions and I thank this forum and its members for giving me the courage to discuss it and I implore others to seek out someone to talk to if they find themselves as wayward as I was. Also, be mindful of your peers and reach out to help others if you notice a change in someone\'s demeanor and habits, which may not be so sudden or apparent. I was really good at lying about how ""okay"" I was just to get people to stop asking questions and leave me alone. It\'s not an easy thing to trust someone with a personal strife and sometimes making the first contact can save a life. \n\nThe battle continues...\n\nAfter picking myself up off the ground, both metaphorically and literally, I decided I was done with prescription medications and stopped taking Accutane immediately. I then began a passionate pursuit of vitamins, minerals, and natural health supplements. I was convinced the problem was internal (where else could this pus, inflammation, and gunk be coming from) and also realized if my wounds and scars were going to heal efficiently I needed to create the ideal nutrient climate in my system. I started with a high protein, high-fiber, high anti-inflammatory/alkaline diet combined with tons of water (with lemon juice) and exercise and gradually moved towards supplementing with additional items. I also recognized that I broke out worse after taking long hot showers or eating certain foods the days before, specifically high-yeast and high-sugar content foods/beverage and cheeses. \n\nI started experimenting, altering every fews months to allow for effective courses with various regimens including Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc, Copper, Vitamin D, Potassium, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, Selenium, DMAE, Cod-Liver Oil, Probiotics, Biotin, and other B-Complexes. I want to note that it is very very important to hydrate diligently and refrain from excessive use of alcohol when taking a hefty supplement load as it can strain your liver and kidneys. I know in college it is difficult to refrain from alcohol altogether so drink A LOT of water throughout the day. Be sure to take the vitamins and supplements at the appropriate time of day and with water or with food as directed. Throwing down a heap of all of them at once is not advised as they react with each other. The result, my skin improved, my energy levels rose and my wounds healed more quickly but I was still experiencing breakouts, though less severe, and rarely anymore forthcoming cystic acne (some deep knots still slumbered under layers of tissue.) I also still had occasional flare-ups and they were almost always isolated to my cheeks, nose, brow, and behind my ears. \n\nI maintained that strategy for a few years but still would wake up every morning to at least one or two new whiteheads and a scattering of blackheads on my nose and brow, and incurred a few scars here and there that deceptively add up over time. Where was this gunk coming from? I knew that I was still missing something and my obsession with ""solving"" the problem led to unwarranted picking again of tiny comedones and milia which sometimes became inflamed and larger because of my prying. I also tried natural topicals such as tea tree oil, manuka oil,manuka honey, lavender oil, baking soda, castor packs and ice baths and though wound healing and recovery time was expedited, the underlying cause was still at work. \n\nThen in a collision of coincidences I made my discovery. It was a combination of reviewing a copy of my medical records which noted several ear infections as a child. While I was sick with a sinus infection I studied the anatomy of sinus passages and discovered chronic sinusitis is actually a yeast infection/candida overgrowth. This can be worsened by long term effects of exposure to antibiotics. Drumroll please....the literal and figurative underlying cause to my chronic acne was my sinuses!\n\nI realized when looking at a diagram of sinus passages that the most prevalent breakout regions on my face were directly above/surrounding my sinuses. My cheeks, nose, brow, temples, behind my ears/neck. I found myself excitedly asking, could I have developed a resistant infection (possibly gram negative/yeast combo + allergy aggravated) in my sinuses that stubbornly resided at varying capacities depending on the strength of my immune system (i.e. flare ups during flu-season / better skin in summer when swimming in/accidentally inhaling ocean salt water) Was this my eureka moment?\n\nI immediately went to the store and bought a ""Neil Med"" sinus rinse set (there are other kinds but this one gives you the ability to slightly pressurize the flow of the solution) which included the non-iodized salt and baking soda packets. Using filtered water I started the process. Much to my dismay I expelled heaps of dark green and brown sludge from deep within my sinus cavities over the next two days. Followed by three days of yellow goo. Followed by a mixed clear/yellow/chunky debris and then nothing but the cleaning solution itself. The result, I honestly felt blessed, like I had taken and extended bath in a Lazarus pit. Not only could I breathe better then ever (didnt really notice impaired breathing before due to the chronic nature of the problem) I could hear better, smell better, taste finer notes of foods, speak more clearly with deeper resonance, and slept like a hibernating bear. I combined that two time a day rinse regimen (three to start) with a Yeast-Fighters supplement. The supplement contains a Fiber Blend (psyllium husk, guar gum, apple pectin, chitosan) Lactobacilus Acidophilus, Garlic Bulb Extract, Herbal Extract Blend (pau d\'arco bark, onion bulb, golden seal, echinacea, black walnut seed) and Caprylic Acid. \n\nOverall result of this ten year investigative and perilous journey has been a success. I can feel my skin beginning to normalize, breakouts have ceased (except for the slow rise of some ancient deposits) I no longer have inflammation and my oil production has returned to a proper functioning status. I continue with the sinus rinse occasionally and still take a vitamin regimen, lots of water, and exercise. When I do get an occasional pimple or exhumed residual cyst I take a warm shower, carefully extract the core (only when ready) then ice the area or run cold water over my face for a few minutes. I then pat dry and apply tea tree and lavender oils as a spot treatment.\n\nAs for the scarring of old, I have found another super-product. Rosehip seed oil. It is an extremely lightweight oil, thinner in viscosity than jojoba and a retinol, high in Vitamin A, C, E and essential fatty acids(linoleic, linolenic, oleic, palmitic, and stearic.) I use it for both overnight spot treatment mixed with lavender oil and as a moisturizer for dry patches as I find it to be non-comedogenic and readily absorbed by the skin. It has a pleasant and subtle woodsy aroma. I\'ve noticed that the darker its tint the more effective it is. I usually apply a few drops to my fingers, pat onto slightly damp skin (better to ice/cool your face beforehand to increase effectiveness) allow to soak in for a few minutes then gently pat/blot the excess oil. I cannot express how grateful I am for this product and its effectiveness. As a retinoid, the oil can aggravate existing acne and should not be used over the entire face everyday. Remember, the healing will take time.\n\nWell it appears my story here has come to an end, I hope this reaches and helps as many people as possible so spread the word! I wish I had solved this years ago but the journey of battling this affliction has made me a stronger and more understanding person, not judging others by their appearance nor assuming causalities. I would be glad to answer any question you might have whether they pertain to the content of this post or something unrelated. Thank you for your time and keeping this valuable supportive community alive.\n'"

keppra,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/eutt79/most_things_are_not_seizures/,b'Most things are not seizures',,"b'I\'m finding that, more and more, ""seizure"" is becoming a catch-all term for literally any clinical phenomenon. Patients may be walking, talking, syncopal, actively having an MI, or all of the above - it\'s all considered seizure if it looks odd enough. In fact, just mentioning key words like ""shaking"" or ""seizure"" is often enough to prompt a neurology consult. Since seizures are a painfully heterogeneous phenomenon, this is not entirely unreasonable. But at the same time - and this should go without saying - most things are not seizures. Lately, some of the things that have raised concern for seizures have been a bit troubling. I feel like a bit of a jerk when I use terms like ""neurophobia,"" but... well, see below.    \n\n\nA few weeks ago, I got a rather breathless call from one of the newer nurses in the ED, asking me to come help with a patient who simply would not stop seizing or fighting with staff (1). Not unkindly, I suggested that usually people are only able to do one of those things at a time. From what I could hear in the background, it sounded like a pitched battle at the moment, the sort of situation required Haldol + security, rather than Dilantin + me. But I knew this nurse; he\'s really nice, and he wouldn\'t have called unless he felt as if he had too. He also fell into that camp that believes that people generally operate by certain rules, and neurology is meant to explain all aberrations (2).     \n\n\nStill, it was early in the week, when you\'re still filled with the sort of free-floating good will that pushed you towards medicine in the first place. So like a saint gearing up to sling alms, I holstered my tuning fork and trundled over to the ED, where I was greeted by the sight of a tall, skinny gargoyle of a man in a hospital gown. He was covered in old tattoos and scratches of varying age, with dried blood sheeting down the side of his head. I could see the tendons in his hands as he clutched the the doorway of his ED room and screamed at staff. Occasionally, he would point people out individually with one accusing finger, and you could see white in all 360 of the degrees around his pupils. Being off to the side just a little, I could also see the bright, quarter moon of his butt cheek as he informed the ED physician that ""I know you, motherfucker.(3)"" I sighed. A little crowd had gathered, maintaining a sensible 10ft radius, and they all watched these proceedings with the sort of ghastly expectation usually reserved for Japanese dating shows and Nascar races. I considered quietly moonwalking back the way I came - but then I saw why they had called me over.    \n\n\nMid-paragraph, he stopped. His teeth clenched and the cords of his neck stood out as he arched his head and neck back. He clenched his fists in front of him and looked very briefly like Bruce Lee warming up for a match. I had just realized that he was holding his breath when he squatted down to a half-crouch, his arms started to shake and his head rolled back - but he remained upright. I\'m sure that, for the bystanders, it was very dramatic. To me, he looked like Bruce Banner forcing a BM and accidentally turning into the Hulk.   \n\n\nThe nurse that had called me started to ask for more ativan, and I told him to hold it for now. I\'d read the chart beforehand: this man had already had enough benzos to fell a rhino in heat; his serum seemed to be 30% gin; his UDS was a Whitman-esque celebration of recreational substances. Overhearing me, the ED resident nodded wisely and started to call for Versed and Dilantin instead. I waved that off too, with a sort of growing desperation. Were we all seeing the same thing?    \n\nBefore somebody could talk themselves into administering a propofol drip with extreme prejudice, I walked over with my hands held up, as if to show that I was unarmed. I asked the patient, - still mid-squat, mind you - if he was doing alright, which was a ridiculous question. But he did look at my face mid-""seizure,"" which was more or less the point. I suggested we hang it up for a little bit and talk in his room, to which he snapped ""This ain\'t my room, shit head. My room is the streets. (4)""    \n\n\nI glanced over his shoulder as if seeing the room for the first time. ""Oh, yeah. Oh, absolutely the streets,"" I agreed. I\'ve found that for these cases - cases with a high likelihood of ending in a scrum followed by 6 months of prophylactic anti-retrovirals - the best approach is to channel the serenity and bafflement of the cow as he crosses the intersection. So, we began to chat. He sat on the edge of (not) his bed while I asked stupid questions and checked stupid reflexes.    \n\n\nI can\'t say that I remember our conversation verbatim, but I do remember certain exchanges.    \n\n\n>Me: *(points to Saving Private Ryan-esque head wound)* ""What happened to your head there?""\n\n\n>Him: ""How should I know?""\n\n\n>Me: ""Well, do you remember what happened before, maybe? Did you fall? Were you in a fight? Did you wake up like that?""\n\n\n>Him: ""Did you wake up like a *bitch*?""    \n\nAnd...\n\n\n>Me: ""Have you ever had seizures before?""\n\n\n>Him: ""Everyone has seizures sometime, man.""\n\n\n>Me: ""I don\'t know about that, but, um, have you ever been on seizure medications before?""\n\n\n>Him: *(looking at me scathingly)* ""No. I don\'t wanna get addicted to that shit.""    \n\nAlso...\n\n>Me: ""Is there anyone I can call? Maybe someone that was with you, might be able to say what happened?""\n\n\n>Him: ""Goddamn sand n-gger, you tryin\' to call Kevin? You tryin\' to call **Kevin**?!""    \n\n\nHe kept repeating this last, louder and louder, as he stood up (5). For my own part, I backed out of the room, just as un-heroic as they come. And dear reader, I shit you not: as I back-pedaled, I heard another nurse warn everyone that ""Here comes another seizure!"" Why, if I hadn\'t been fleeing like a coward, I\'d have had no words.    \n\nThe patient came out right after me, his hands tearing at his hospital gown. In a blink, he had it off and wadded up into a loose ball, which he fired past my head at the nursing station. He stood there, naked and heaving, covered in bizarre tattoos - lots of faded blue dice on his forearms, harlequin masks, sundry big boobed devils on motorcycles, etc. But, more specifically and terrifyingly, he had a tattoo of a wolf howling, drawn *en face* in faded blue ink with orange eyes - and it was tattooed on his crotch in such a way that his penis seemed to emerge from its mouth.    \n\n\nThis, I found, was my absolute limit. The bad consult I could handle. The swearing, insults and racism I could chalk up to hard living and neuro-chemical extremis. But the wolf? That had taken time and *forethought*. It was clearly the watermark of a personality that would take any AED\'s I started and return them to me rectally, before stealing my car keys. Security swarmed in, and I walked out.    \n\n\nAs I did, I passed the hospitalist he was being admitted to, and she asked me if I would be ordering an MRI, Keppra, any of that.    \n\n\nI sighed again. ""No, He\'s got PNES, chronic crazy and essential racism. Let\'s start with a head CT and an EEG, if we can get them.""    \n\n\n""But he\'s still seizing,"" she replied, looking at the anarchy over my shoulder. I looked back to see him hulking out again, as no less than three burly rent-a-cops tried to bulldoze him back into his room. Blessedly, the crowd of bodies kept me from finding out if he had an erection.    \n\n\n""I don\'t think that\'s a seizure,"" I said, trying not to sound appalled.    \n\n\n""Yes, he\'s seizing. I see it,"" she replied, and she actually pointed, as if that would clear things up for me. As if she hadn\'t been clear enough, or perhaps in case I\'d gotten confused and examined the clothed, 82yo woman one room over.    \n\n\n""Please don\'t take this the wrong way, but I don\'t think a seizure is what you think it is,"" I said, before shimmering out.    \n\n----\n\n\n1) I don\'t get called to the ED very much, and that\'s by design. We actually have a few separate neurology teams. If there\'s a patient that needs to be dipped in rTPA, the stroke team comes running. If somebody woke up with a couple of burst pipes, the neuro ICU is standing by with soft voices and warm hands. If somebody is having seizures, or anything resembling one, the ED orders a Hellfire strike of benzos with one hand, while putting in a non-urgent consult for ""prolonged post-ictal state"" with the other. Given all of these heroes - who are likely doing kettlebell swings or one-armed pullups while waiting for the Commissioner to blaze the signal - there\'s really only a sliver of niche emergencies that would require someone like me. This was not one of those cases.    \n\n2) I tend to feel that the practice of neurology adheres to certain principles, while humanity - the species that yielded both Ska and Suge Knight - is a heaving mass of carbon and wild-eyed outliers, screaming into a void.    \n\n3) He did, as it turned out. They\'d met during his last visit to the ED, during which he\'d threatened to beat up the little old lady in the room next to him before leaving AMA. So, you know, believe your patient.    \n\n4) While he could have said it more nicely, he wasn\'t wrong. Besides, seizure aborted, right? I take my wins wherever and however I can.    \n\n5) I am demonstrably non-white, but didn\'t seem to be what disturbed him most. If you can categorize things like this, I would say that he was being more collaterally than primarily racist. He seemed more focused on my possibly getting in touch with Kevin. I never found out much about Kevin, but it\'s hard to imagine that they shared a cubicle wall at the NAACP.\n----\n\nEdit: \n\nThank you so much for the gold(s)! There have been some concerns, and so I\'d like to clarify a few things: \n\n-I\'m not trying to make fun of people with epilepsy, or those with PNES (or those with both). I\'m simply trying to point out the tremendous amount of misunderstanding surrounding epileptic seizures. Hopefully while being funny. Obviously, your mileage may vary.\n\n-I didn\'t simply stop treating this guy. I did try to figure out if he had epilepsy, which had led to him injuring himself. It was hard, because he was really difficult to deal with. I wasn\'t able to amass any evidence that he had epilepsy. \n\n-In particular, PNES is a very real and debilitating condition, and frankly, I didn\'t take it seriously enough for far too long during my residency. I regret that very much. People with PNES are not ""faking."" Distinguishing between these things is important.'"

influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/vvuk96/how_to_get_help/,b'How to get help?',,"b'This long post is pretty much a plea for advice from anyone who can help.\n\nPhotos of symptoms are attached below.\n\nThese are probably multiple conditions that randomly started all at once. I have never had any health problems before this.\n\nMy mom had similar episodes but doctors never figured out what had happened. MRIs were fine. She was later diagnosed with Lupus. She passed away at 53 due to sepsis from prolonged Coumadin.\n\nAbout 2.5 months ago I started noticing a right droopy eyelid and non-injury related lower back pain.\n\nA little after this time, my dog got tapeworm. He never had been bitten by a tick, but was positive, treated quickly, and got rid of it.\n\nShortly after, I started noticing that it was more difficult for me to walk him a block around our neighborhood. I was out of breath.\n\nAdditionally, my stools changed. There were pale white chunks, and what I know now, was mucus. When I showed the picture of mucus to a doctor, given the recent tapeworm with my dog, praziquantel was prescribed. I was (and still am) unable to use the restroom until every 6-8 days with very hard stools.\n\nAround this time, being unable to walk short distances became worse. Weakness, for the first time in my life, became debilitating. I played goalkeeper and am a strong woman. My muscles are gone from my calves and my arms. Weakness is worse on the right side of my body. I began to struggle to open a car door or a heavy store door during this rime, about a month ago.\n\nAdditionally, around this time, my hands and feet became freezing cold. Even in 90 degree weather, I needed to wear gloves. No fever.\n\nGastro issues shortly after taking praziquantel did not improve, and I began noticing fiber strands in my stools even though I take fiber supplements.\n\nWe decided it was time to go to the ER, and, since Mayo is supposedly the best, we drove up from Tampa to Jacksonville to visit my better halfs family and to go to the ER due to circulation issues and weakness.\n\nDuring this time, stool tests from Quest were still pending because they had a delay.\n\nBloodwork at Mayo all looked fine. ER doctor said that there was nothing wrong with me, bloodwork looked good. By this time, I could barely walk and my feet were beginning to drag on the ground.\n\nI began noticing cuts in my gums.\n\nTwo days later, I collapsed. I dont remember most of it. Somehow, even with constipation, I lost control of my bowels. The ambulance took me to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nThis time, the ER doctor said he suspected I was malingering, but ran my blood tests and noticed a calcium deficiency that was not there 2 days before. Everything else looked fine. I became upset at myself for not being able to make my body work, and went back home.\n\nAbout 4 days later, my droopy eyelid became a lot worse. My face looked like someone elses. Weakness was worse than ever. I began slurring words. I had a sore throat and fever that also started on this day.\n\nWe went back to the ER, but this time at UF Health. Positive for Covid after being negative the previous ER visits. I stayed there for 3 days. They decided these issues were due to malnutrition and loss of appetite. I began to get hives all over and swelling on my right side only at the time of discharge.\n\nCovid symptoms quickly went away before discharge. I am vaccinated and have already had it twice before.\n\nStool tests came back negative for parasites.\nNegative for Lyme.\n\nI had a fluctuating iron deficiency, fluctuating calcium levels, and high ALT levels. \n\nEverything else looked fine.\n\nThis time, when released, I could not walk or hold my head up, I needed a wheelchair and learned airplane pillows are great for neck support.\n\nFinally, a rheumatologist saw me and noticed my face was uneven. Then, a neurologist said these symptoms seemed like classic Myasthenia Gravis and ordered bloodwork. So far, bloodwork is negative but waiting on MUSK. She also ordered a EMG nerve test in mid August. She also diagnosed me with Raynauds.\n\nYesterday, my drooping eye and mouth came back (they come and go every day but were worse), I started to have trouble thinking, and I began slurring words with R in them. We went back to the ER and was discharged after feeling better halfway through the visit. Even though I have been eating and bloodwork is normal, again, they blamed malnourishment.\n\nI have been going downhill for the past month. Work has been very patient, but I need to go to a business trip in the beginning of August. I cant hold my head up, even on a good day, longer than 3 hours.\n\nIf I dont get treated sooner than a month and a half, I will risk losing the that I love. And my insurance. ER visit costs are adding up.\n\nAll tests and bloodwork looks normal.\n\nWhat can I do to get treated?\n\nIn Florida, the soonest that I can get the nerve test is mid August. \n\nTo be clear, I dont care what I have, I just want a diagnosis to get treated. I wish the Mayo ER doctors were right and I was able to make this go away myself. Its incredibly upsetting not being able to.\n\nGastro issues are still unaddressed, but only weakness is debilitating.\n\nBrain MRI with and without contrast is normal.\n\nI work remotely, have UnitedHealthcare PPO, and can travel out of state.\n\nMy PCP will not give urgent referrals and says I need to be prepared for not getting a diagnosis and learning to live with it. Which tells me he doesnt believe anything is wrong. Since my droopy face is off and on, he has not seen it although I think there are pictures in my record. A link to photos is also attached to this post.\n\nThe neurologist said she will not give a blank referral outside of UF Health and no one can do the EMG nerve test sooner within the UF Health network. Am on a wait list, but its a 2 hour slot.\n\nI am waiting on my moms death certificate to be mailed to me from a family member so I can provide her health history to rheumatology, in case theres something helpful. She apparently also had an autopsy.\n\nSo far, autoimmune tests are negative for everything except Hashimotos, but Thyroid is fine. \n\nANA negative. My mom was also ANA negative but she had lupus symptoms, including the butterfly rash. I do not.\n\nMy only medication currently is Wellbutrin, which I have been on for about 4 years.\n\nI am 36 years old. I can write this post now, but literally last night I could not even pick up a phone and text a sentence.\n\n[Symptom Photos](https://app.box.com/s/e48j13f3ul206q8bkw4uang4qcziw12r)'"

namenda,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/jxd7ju/serious_can_my_doctor_just_stop_prescribing_9/,b'[Serious] Can my doctor just stop prescribing 9 medications taken consistently for 4 years?',,"b'\\[Posted and deleted from /r/psychiatry\\]\n\nIt\'s been two days since I\'ve taken any of the following (or slept), so please forgive any errs.\n\nLexapro, Gabapentin, Pregabalin, Clonidine, Trazadone, Wellbutrin, Namenda, Nuvigil, Mydayis and Suboxone.\n\nShort version: 2 months ago my long time psyche doc decided to focus entirely on coronavirus related (psychiatric) symptoms. He said, here\'s a month\'s supply of your 10 medications, go find a new doc. I recently changed jobs with downgraded insurance, and so began to make calls to the narrower field of folks in my new network. As you may have guessed, with the terrifying uptick of pandemic / election related mental illness, psychiatrists taking on new patients are few and far between, especially in my heavily infected state.\n\nAs my supplies dwindled, I grew desperate and rang my old PCP to see if she could help. She didn\'t even have time to see me, but got me in with her PA who saw me face to face, and bless his heart, prescribed the Lexapro cause he\'s a good fucking guy. I\'ve been in touch with my old doc throughout, and his last text from this afternoon in response to my asking what to do reads - ""I don\'t know. I think people go to an urgent care center"". Not wanting to risk my life or that of my wife without merit, I replied ""I can be at one in 10 minutes. To confirm, they\'ll be able to contact you to confirm the history, and write these prescriptions?"". Then nada.\n\nI\'m totally up for advice as my entire body is tensing like one gargantuan monkey\'s fist. My withdrawal experience includes valium, synthetic cannabinoids (yea it was a thing), methamphetamine and heroin. But I was never expected to hold down a corp job while doing so, nor endure all at once. There\'s no end in sight, and forgive the dramatic bravado but I\'m scared shitless. Like, it\'s leaking out of me (where my subs at?). Also, I do not have the funds to purchase , most or all of these from dark web vendors, or pay ER prices (repeatedly).\n\nThanks in advance for words of wisdom. In Jesus\' name we pray, amen. And if you hear about an MA state resident ramming his Impala into the side of a CVS pharmacy before bounding over the wreckage to walk away with just one month\'s supply of each aforementioned medication, well, I might know a guy.

I never had any problems with my bp before but that day I was being foolish and drank 3 energy drinks, had little food and no water while hunting on a mountain ridge. I got home and had an earsplitting headache. My bp was extremely high when I went to the er (not sure specifically but it was around 200/125). Ever since I have had problems with feeling fatigued, having frequent panic attacks when I had none before. I am having chest pains a little bit of everywhere but its a daily occurrence and every time I've mentioned it to a doctor or been to an er they don't know why. My hands get cold and numb same with my feet sometimes. Had an echocardiogram, cardiac stress test, chest x rays, and a chest CT, and they have found nothing. My dad had a negative reaction to lisinopril and was put on Norvasc and greatly improved. Yet every time I mention it I am dismissed. This is affecting my every day life, I am missing significant amounts of work and can't enjoy daily life with my family. I don't know where else to turn, so any suggestions are greatly appreciated! I am also on buspirone 10mg twice daily (for anxiety). Omeprazole 40mg (for heartburn, which does nothing) singulair 10mg (for asthma) vitamin d3 50,000 IU (Once weekly for a deficiency) once a day mens daily vitamin, and again the Lisinopril 10mg.

Only useful for major depressive episodes**\n\n* **Wellbutrin (Buproprion) has worked very well for depression, but always triggers a bad manic episode after a couple of months and I have to stop**\n\n* **If I am under a lot of pressure at work, the combination of 36 - 54mg of Concerta and ten joints a day helps me produce amazing work, but it is super unhealthy. I\'m not currently working, smoking pot or taking Concerta.**\n\n* **Anticonvulsants lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine have helped with mood swings, but I am unable to focus**\n\n* **Ketogenic diet has helped with brain-fog, but it has not been the magic bullet I\'ve been looking for (although I did lose 50 pounds)**\n\n\nI\'m 40 years and was put on **40mg of Ritalin** when I was around 6 or 7. That amount was raised to **60mg** when I was 11. I was taken off it suddenly when I entered HS, because that\'s what they did back then.\n\nAfter years of study problems at college, I started taking it again around age 20, this time taking it as needed, in **5 or 10mg** dosages, typically **20mg a day** but as much as **30mg** if I had a lot of studying. For whatever reason, I\'ll stop taking it after some time. Maybe my insurance changed or I felt it was just making me too edgy, but I always stop and then I start to have problems with work (I am a programmer, I need to focus). \n\nI started **smoking pot on a daily basis** around the age of 23, which helped me focus and and reduced my anxiety, but over time, it creates more anxiety as I\'d be constantly worried about running out, running to pick up, etc. It is a bank-account draining, PiTA and given the volume that I need to smoke when I smoke, it\'s better to not smoke at all. \n\nI struggled a bit with controlling my cannabis use in my late 20s/early 30s. I\'d feel better not smoking, but I would get very, very depressed and occasionally have a manic episode. \n\nI thought maybe I was addicted to cannabis and that these were withdrawal symptoms. I went cold turkey for 3 years and began exercising intensely and the symptoms only got worse. \n\nBy this point, I had tried a few **SSRIs**. I would take them out of desperation, they\'d get me out of my funk, but after a while I would just feel like a vegetable and I would have to stop taking them.\n\nThe doctor I saw suggested I try **Wellbutrin**. Almost immediately, I felt ""normal"". It gave me a lot of energy, also, but the energy would just keep growing and growing until I would snap and do something harmful to myself like throw my bicycle at the wall because of some perceived insult. He tried pairing it with **Lamictal** to stabilize my mood, but that didn\'t work.\n\nI stopped taking the **Wellbutrin**, and I went on **Concerta**. I was hesitant, but the doctor really upsold it. It worked very well, with some caveats:\n\n* It was brand new, so there was no generic and I knew I was getting the best quality drug\n* It still had the anxiety inducing side effects that had me resorting to cannabis to balance out. \n* I don\'t like being on it all day and would rather take as needed. **36mg** is not enough and **54mg** is too much and my insurance won\'t cover any more than 1 pill a day, so 27mg once or twice a day is not an option.\n\nThis was about five years ago or so, and I\'ve been caught in this loop of giving up and going back.\n\nI\'ve lost a lot of faith in the medical profession, especially the mental health wing. For years, doctors have been telling me to eat low-fat, lots of grains, blabbity blah blah. I\'d been vegetarian on an off most of my adult life, overweight my entire life and up until about 10 months ago, I had been on a vegan diet. The vegan diet caused my triglycerides to skyrocket and I became pre-diabetic. I discovered the **ketogenic diet** and figured, why not? It couldn\'t get any worse.\n\nTen months later I am 50lbs lighter and all of my blood work is within a normal range. I eat bacon and eggs almost every day, fatty steaks, butter, bone broths, liver (yuk!), all these things I was told to eat sparingly. **IMHO, most doctors in America are only in it for the money and are reading from a script, like any other mediocre salesman.** I have a bit of a bias, as my grandfather was an OB/GYN who had grown up in poverty and often worked for free, and would often lament the steep ethical decline the profession had taken over the course of his life.\n\nI have been more or less managing my mental health through general practitioners over the years, telling them what I want. I\'ve kind of hit a wall with this.\n\n\n**This is what I understand about myself:** \n\n* I respond well to drugs that affect **dopamine** and **norepinephrine** levels. Drugs that operate on **serotonin** seem to make me vegetative and unmotivated and give me a false sense of happiness. \n* Too much **norepinephrine** and I will have a manic episode\n* **adderall** feels to me like **speed**, and **ritalin** does not. As I understand it, the difference between the two is that **Ritalin** acts as a **reuptake inhibitor** for these **neurotransmitters**, whereas **Adderall** provides a substitute for them. [[Reference]](http://www.progressivehealth.com/ritalin-adderal.htm)\n* **Adderall** and **Ritalin** both make me edgy, although I seem to get a lot more done on the Ritalin. \n* Cannabis helps me focus, which is atypical of most people, but not atypical of programmers.  I imagine cannabis figured heavily into the creation of reddit.\n* No [Ballmer Peak](http://xkcd.com/323/) for me, however. One sip of alcohol and my brain completely fogs up and I am useless and my ADHD symptoms skyrocket. My worst manic episodes have been under the influence of alcohol, so I try and avoid it altogether. \n\n\nMore recently, I have started **DBT**  and my therapist suggested that internet porn may be rotting my mind. This news kind of bowled me over. I\'m a guy, I get distracted by me needs, and I try and satisfy them as quickly as possible so I can get back to work. The **Adderall** especially tends to increase my sex drive (as did the **Wellbutrin**) and sometimes I would **fap** 3 - 5 times a day. The reading I\'ve done suggests that all that **fapping** combined with the visual stimuli may be affecting **dopamine** levels. I am experimenting with abstaining from porn, but it made me think about how sometimes I would **fap** first thing in the morning if I couldn\'t get out of bed, because it would give me energy. Perhaps it gave me a burst of dopamine that would propel me into the shower, I don\'t know.\n\nI will dig through the archives, but any immediate thoughts on **Modafinil**?\n'"

So, the short of it? I\'m 21, I have autism, I\'m about as depressed and beaten as you can imagine, and in essence, I\'m fighting my own personal Vietnam in that deep down, at this stage in my life, I know I can\'t win this one. I beat a nervous breakdown at 9 years old, I survived the loss of the one teacher who took a battered 11 year old Year 7 and have him hope, only to fuck off and die just 8 or so months later. I survived the fact my life was rigged from the start to be against me, single mother, council house in a rough area, borderline Narcissistic grandmother and an uncle who created a family rift by cutting himself off from his family and choosing to stay with a woman who beat him, abused him and left him a pathetic mess (I\'m just venting, please don\'t judge me for that because I know abuse is a very horrible and comped thing, I just don\'t like him very much). I survived the tortures of adolescence, of my PTSD playing catch up, I survived the teacher who used to act as if lunchtime at primary school was a military drill, who used to single me out as I was weak and use me as an example to the other kids to clean their plates or be punished. But what did it, was a combination of several things. 1. Learning school and realising I was a nothing in a great big something. 2. Allowing my ambition to cloud my own  bodies warning signs that I was not coping with GCSE\'s, leaving school, and transitioning to College. 3. Developing several severe phobias, the largest of which centred around vision loss and eventually led to me becoming a total shut in with only sporadic trips out of the house for medical issues mostly. In the UK we live school at 16, this began at 16, I\'m now 21. You do the math. 5 years of this. In the last 8 months alone I\'ve developed an inability to swallow solid foods, am suffering recurrent and frequent collapsed lungs, am being checked for possible genetic conditions, one of which is Marfan\'s, have had covid and may have it again (and only have 1 jab due to the issues with vaccine shortages and other nonsense at the moment in the UK), am at present suffering a chest infection or covid as I previously said I don\'t know which, and am a slave to waiting lists. I am becoming a time waster in the eyes of EMS and GP\'s who don\'t seem to realise \nI HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO TURN TO!\nI\'m losing weight, my sight is growing worse, I\'m facing a future so uncertain it is beyond a joke. And what have I realised you ask?\n\n\nI can either die naturally, kill myself, or reserve myself to the fact I am looking at a future where I am in and out of hospital and barely functioning or mobile. The funny thing is I found god this past year, even if I sometimes question why he\'d let this happen to me. Not just me either. My mum is barely coping, and we are just punching bags for each other\'s frustrations. We can\'t lash out at the NHS so we lash out at ourselves. She\'s a type 2 diabetic with more baggage than an easy jet cargo bay and she\'s battling this alone as much as I am. Lockdowns were the kicker, and I can\'t tell you how much I\'d murder the entirety of the British Parliament if it were an option right now, not that I will obviously. I was starting to see a light in 2019, and by 2020 it was beginning to burn out, by 2021 it was barely alive, and now? Its gone. Darkness, a whole lot of darkness. My best friend is an emotionally unstavle wreck I can\'t accept is dragging me down as much as I am her because she\'s about the only person who knows me emotionally, inside and out. I\'m living in a house where I sleep in the same room as my own mither because the council have never bothered to move us somewhere applicable or give us an extension. I\'ve been pushed and prodded and poked and stabbed so many times by people\'s ignorance, arrogance, and general callousness that I feel like a piece of Swiss cheese. I can\'t even reply to friends who reach out, or bother to open to those lines that I desperately want to because I\'m too embarased and ashamed. And worse of all, I\'m so fucking lonely. All the time. It doesn\'t matter if I\'m alone or with someone, if I\'m chatting or not chatting. I don\'t feel like I\'m even here.  It all comes back to this desperate prodding, I can\'t look into the last anymore because it doesn\'t bring me joy anymore, just pain. I look at some of the friends I haven\'t spoken to in years, close one\'s too, one\'s that fizzled out because I couldn\'t keep up that friendship when I was aware of the fact I was falling while they were growing. And it kills me. It. Kills. Me. Every waking minute is pain, and I can\'t take it anymore. I ask for help and I get a 6 month with list to be told by an ENT doctor to carry on as I am. I get a wait and see approach for a dietician.

I call a crisis line, I get bullshit advice that can\'t help me. I go on the NHS website I get told ""Help is there for you"", but like one of Boris\'s campaign promises it evaporates into thin air like a hobo\'s piss in the cold. What I know is this, when the time comes, I\'m taking my own life. I\'m doing it on my terms. If that ends up being the last thing I get to control, I want it to be my terms.

astaxanthin,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical_advice/comments/pah7mw/doctors_dont_know_whats_wrong/,b'Doctors dont know whats wrong',,"b'Im a 30 yr old male, Caucasian, about 290 pounds and 56. About two or three months ago now I started on medication for adhd as well as depression. About a month or so later I had gotten terribly dizzy for weeks and went to the ER and eventually developed (I think) depersonalization.\n\nSo at the start of this year, I saw a doctor for possibly adhd, who basically told me it was depression and not adhd. I know I have depression, but that wasnt what was causing my attention problems.\n\nMy symptoms are:\n-hyperfixation\n-fidgeting (leg bouncing, etc)\n-trouble focusing (hurts to focus sometimes, cant focus on something for more than a few minutes to an hour)\n-bad memory\n-trouble with conversation or focusing on them(possibly social anxiety)\n-constantly late and forgetting things\n-not finding enjoyment in doing things I like\nThe list goes on\n\nNow I mentioned all this to the doctor, and they sent me to a psychiatrist who then told me I had sleep anxiety or some technical term for it and gave me anxiety meds. They didnt help and just made me drowsy.\n\nA few months later I saw another psychiatrist who proceeded to put me on different pills for the next few months to see what worked. First they put me on adhd meds, I forget what it was called, but it didnt work, then anti-depressants, Bupropion XL, which did seem to make me happier after a while, but then put me on an adhd medication as well, dexmethylphenidate.\n\nThis one seemed to help, but I couldnt sleep for about three or four days. On the fourth night or so, I had randomly gotten dizzy. The room span for a few seconds whenever I tilted my head and I had a general dizzy feeling which is hard to explain. This lasted for a week, and I had gotten pretty scared, so I went to the doctor who basically said I should get get checked at the ER. I told them about the medication and everything. There they gave me a head scan, a chest scan, a blood test and one or two other tests I cant remember. They all came back normal and they estimated I just had vertigo and gave me anti vertigo pills, Meclizine. These didnt help and just made me drowsy.\n\nThe dizziness lasted for about another month, and as this happened, I seemed to develop depersonalization. Its extremely hard to explain, but when I look around it feels like my eyes arent seeing anything or that theyre not open enough. Its as if Im looking through a pair of VR goggles constantly. I had a very minor case before all of this, but it was manageable. The dizziness also made the anti depressants stop working.\n\nI told my psychiatrist this and they checked my dna records and put me on a new anti depressant that was completely safe for my type. This didnt work at all. They then put me on medication that would help the depersonalization which was really for anxiety. The first day I took the pill, my whole body felt numb and I felt like I had a bad flu. The dizziness came back full force and my depersonalization got even worse.\n\nNow, I left the psychiatrist and am off any meds I was on. Its been about two months or so now, and I still have bad depersonalization, get dizzy spells occasionally, and still cant focus or get anything done. Its been affecting my mood and social life pretty badly, I dont feel like going out or anything because it doesnt feel real. Ive tried ignoring it and taking vitamins and supplements to help but it feels like it keeps worse than better than worse.\n\nIm still not sure if it was the medication or anything else. I havent been sleeping well at all, and I feel like maybe thats affecting it. I have a lot of brain fog, but am always using electronics with blue light, so maybe thats it? Also I cant find glasses that fit, so the ones I have dig into the sides of my head which affects it as well I think.\n\nI should mention I did have a pretty bad episode of panic attacks in March due to thinking I had COVID. I got checked multiple times and didint have it (turns out it was just acid reflux) but Im not sure if those attacks brought it about as well.\n \nI also have had a case of chronic headaches for quite a few years now.

I am currently seeing a Neurologist who is running more tests, but I would appreciate any insight as I am desperate. The neurologist hasn\'t communicated a suspected diagnosis as of yet. The headache is significant and impacts my daily life, I have only been able to work part time since (at most 2 days a week). Some photophobia, pain is a constant, stabbing, ache, typically in the forehead/temple/behind eyes area, alternates from side to side depending on the day. Some times are manageable (3/10), others are debilitating (8/10).\n\n36 year old male5\'11"", 270lbVegetarianBritish ancestry, CanadaNon-smoker (never have), 0-2 drinks per week, no recreational drugs, 0.5-1 cup of coffee per dayCurrent meds: Amlodapine, Indapamide, Candisartan, Mirtazipine (all for several years).\n\nPrior medical history:\n\n1.

L4-L5 Spondylolisthesis\n\nJust over 6 months ago, I woke up with a 6/10 headache and significant ""blurry-ness"" in my left eye. As an optometrist was the easiest and quickest option, that\'s where I went first. The optometrist imaged my retina, performed some in-office tests, and recommended I see my doctor (although everything seemed normal to her).\n\nDue to COVID, I had a phone appointment with my doctor who referred me to an ophthalmologist. It is worth noting, my headache had not (and still has not) subsided.\n\nThe ophthalmologist did a series of tests, and determined that I just ""woke up and realized I needed glasses,"" as everything was normal (minus a red-cap test where colours were less vivid in my left eye) and he assumed my issues were refractory.\n\nAs the headache had not resolved, my family doctor sent me for a head MRI without contrast, which was normal, minus some maxillary sinusitis, which was treated with an antibiotic.\n\nA subsequent head CT a month later was also normal.\n\nApproximately 6 weeks after onset, my vision returned to normal (or at least near normal), and on a follow-up appointment my ophthalmologist was surprised and elated that the vision in my left eye had improved at least 90%. With testing, it is still weaker than my right, but that may have been the case before.\n\nTried 3 different ""migraine"" medications (Rizatriptan RPD, Metoclopramide, Topiramate) with no effect, and a severe reaction to the Maxalt.\n\nAt the direction of my family doc, went to the ER for ""migraine protocol"" - IV dexamethazone, metoclopramide, tordol. -- Headache completely resolved for the first time since onset, however returned that evening (about 8 hours later).\n\nIncidentally, developed a stubborn non-productive cough, my family physician treated with 10 days of prednisone (50mg/day) - By the 10th day my quality of life and pain had improved by at least 80%. That and the IV in the ER have been the only thing that gave me relief.\n\nRecently (past couple of weeks) I have noticed some diminished eyesight in my left eye once more. I have a followup with the ophthalmologist next week so he can check it objectively then.\n\nLast week I had a cervical and thoracic MRI (without contrast out of renal concern), which the initial report says is normal, aside from some ""mild degeneration"" to the thoracic discs. I do have access to the images, so I am attaching some that look concerning to me, however I am no radiologist to say the least. I have a followup with my neurologist in 7 weeks so I have not spoken to him about these scans yet.\n\nSide note: ENT had let me know that the vision/headache isn\'t and never was a result of the history of sinusitis.\n\nAbnormal bloodwork:\n\nC Rreactive Protein: HI 6.2 mg/LCH50-Hemolytic Complement: HI >60 kU/LRBC: LO 4.14  x E12/LMCH: HI 33.8 pgPhosphate: LO 0.67 mmol/LUrate: HI 590 umol/L\n\nOf note: Thyroid, ESR, and Nuclear Antibody tests were normal/negative.\n\nPossibly relevant symptoms:\n\n1.

For the past 6-9 months I have had an intermittant red, flaking rash on my face, around my nose, mouth and chin. I had a doctor tell me it ""looks like eczema""\n4.

Advil,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1k87fj/sighback_to_square_one/,b'Sigh...back to square one',,"b""This is a continuation of the last post I submitted here ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1gzclg/report_update_zinc_supplementation/)).  I was doing very well until I had a major dairy binge about two weeks ago.  At that time I also made a few changes to my regimen, introducing the Acne.org AHA lotion (AHA+ they call it) and 3mg of copper along with my daily 25mg of zinc.  So my daily regimen looked like this:\n\n* shower, use cold water for last 30 seconds of shower\n* optional shave\n* moisturizer + tea tree oil\n* 36mg zinc + 4mg copper (11mg zinc + 0.9mg copper provided by multivitamin)\n\n\nAt night:\n\n* cleanser (spectro jel)\n* half and half moisturizer and AHA+\n\nAbout 3 days after my massive dairy binge, involving cheesecake and pizza, I broke out like crazy and my skin hasn't been right since.  I'm mad at myself for that...I don't know why I thought it'd be okay to do that.  I feel like it's gotten a bit worse since then, too.  I stuck to this regimen strictly but I haven't noticed a very quick improvement like the last time my cystic acne came back.  I have a feeling that either the AHA+ or the added copper is hurting my progress, which is a shame.  I got a blood test a few weeks ago that showed my copper/zinc levels were fine, right before I started to take the copper, so I'm wondering if I was actually deficient in zinc in the first place and I might have screwed that balance up.  It's a real bummer, because I was clear for such a long period of time!  The reason I started the AHA was to speed up the process of getting rid of those, and it did help.  But I fear it might have made my acne worse in the process.  Another possibility is the cleansing step causing problems, as I've noted before.  I tried a few things, such as using a clay mask, BP spot treatment, using some nights with AHA on and some nights with it off, and upping to 50mg of zinc daily instead of 36, but I haven't noticed a marked improvement.  I've tried some anti-inflammatories too such as advil, aspirin, to no real avail.  So, I'm reverting to my last known good configuration, which is:\n\nDay:\n\n* shower, use cold water for last 30 seconds of shower\n* optional shave\n* moisturizer + tea tree oil\n* 36mg zinc + 0.9mg copper (11mg zinc + 0.9 copper provided by multivitamin)\n\nNight:\n\n* moisturizer + tea tree oil\n\nThat regimen seems to have worked the best for me, so far.  I'm thinking after I get it under control again, I'll try some kind of retinoid instead to get the redness down.  This may be TMI, but for the guys reading this, I'm going to also do /r/NoFap while abiding by this regimen, as I've read that it'll boost your zinc levels.  Whether it'll matter or not, well, hard to say.\n\nWish me luck, and as you all know I will keep you updated."""

We spent almost 2 hours at the lab today and he came through and sat in the chair four times but he freaked out and started crying and trying to run away each time and of course I\'m not going to physically force him to do anything. I couldn\'t do it anymore so we left after the fourth try. My husband tried the first time and couldn\'t even get him to go inside the lab. I tried the second time and he bit me so hard I bled (he\'s not bitten me since he was a toddler).  \n  \nHe\'s a great, well adjusted little guy I love to bits, but he fixates on his fear of the pain and can\'t distract himself or use any coping mechanisms we\'ve tried in therapy once he gets into that fearful thought loop. Crazy thing is he\'s had blood tests before and not had any issues, but he did find getting the COVID vaccines hard so I think it\'s fear from that experience.  \n  \nThings we\'ve tried/considered:.  \n- watching me go first/talking him through what\'s happening - he finds this more stressful, he doesn\'t want to think about what is going to happen.  \n- emla patches (numbing medication) - he had those on today and it didn\'t help with his fear at all despite the phlebotomist showing him his skin was numb multiple times. He is (very reasonably) scared it will hurt one the needle penetrates his numb skin.  \n- bring his iPad/current novel he\'s reading in with him - he can\'t focus on it enough to get distract him.  \n- rewards - he is usually very rewards driven, but this is too big an emotional reaction to see this pay-off logically a worth the fear and possible pain.  \n- taking breaks to distract and calm down - obviously this works to help emotionally regulate after each try, but didn\'t seem to help get him to a different mindset to have a more successful attempt.  \n   \nOf course having an older woman in the waiting area ask ""is he done or did he walk out?"" after an attempt then come up and show him her band-aid and say ""see, I did it, it\'s easy"" is sooo helpful too. The staff today were wonderful and we\'ll try again there, but I really need some thoughts or ideas from people with experience in this situation. It\'s frustrating not knowing if there\'s something else (like a vitamin deficiency) going on we could help with and mortifying going to each paediatrician appointment and being asked about if we\'ve done the test and having to say no. Thoughts?  \n  \nEdit: forgot to add this is a fasting blood test, which of course doesn\'t help with his resilience as the longer we are there the hungrier more poor little guy gets '"

One example is a patient with bipolar disorder who has been treated with clonazepam 1mg QID and nothing else. Geriatric patients on tenazepam for sleep, and several patients on benzodiazepines for sleep/anxiety AND opiates for chronic pain (without snri, tca or gabapentinoid). \n\nThese are not situations I am comfortable with really but Im stuck on this contract to stay in the USA with my family. My attendings back in residency almost never co-signed long term opiates or benzos outside of palliative patients, which is my preference honestly. \n\nOnce a patient has been on chronic benzos for years and years, how can I avoid prescribing?

Then, thank god for my boosted creativity from ALCAR, or maybe its just me, but I remember reading the mechanism of how the cells start working faster, and transport energy because of COQ10, ALA/ALCAR and adderall.

I believe it works pretty effectively even on the small 0.25mg dosage Im on\n\n* Escitalopram 10mg\n\n  * I believe I was prescribed the for anxiety and depression and this should take 4-8 weeks to kick in (I\'m about 2 and a half weeks into this)\n\nFor ADHD:\n\n* Adderall XR 10mg\n\n  * I believe I was prescribed this for the adhd (they say the plan is to increase this every 2 weeks until I get the desired effect). So far I think it *might* be helping??? but its too close to placebo to call effective. I have noticed feeling less hungry though, which is great.\n\n---\n\nOk, context out of the way, what are my fears?\n\nThe recommended instructions for Clonazepam say to take 2 per day as needed (which I assume to mean that I don\'t take it on days I am not in anxiety filled situations. The psychiatrist said they expect Ill take one a day in the morning (where I said the most anxiety comes usually from a scheduled work meeting).\n\nThe last weekend I did so anyways, but this weekend did not.\n\nThis monday morning early morning like 3AM (I didn\'t really get much sleep so this is when I woke up), I felt fucking awful. Like I lay there anxious as I\'ve ever been with no particular thoughts about anything anxiety inducing in particular but just kept thinking ""I should just fucking kill myself and be done with it"" and dreaming of the blissful lack of pain/fade to white and then nothing at the end of jumping off a tall building.\n\nThe whole time I realized this was super unhealthy and uncharacteristically strong. Like for the past ... over a decade of my life I have generally been depressed and thought casually , but never with strong emotion about it, and I still maintain that my plan is to only see it as an option when my options for trying to treat it seem like they are running out (in practical terms meaning that after I\'ve tried with at least one more psychiatrist if this doesn\'t work out, gotten a psychologist I vibe with this psychiatrist etc) I would throw in the towel.\n\nAnyhow my point here is, for around 2 weeks I have been much less anxiety filled and have had a much less depressed mood than normal with hope for my future given the positive effects I had seen with both the Adderall and Clonazepam. I don\'t feel like I was actually at any danger of killing myself, but the emotion to do so so suddenly despite my the previous 2 weeks or so of a heightened mood has me worried about my medications.\n\nIs it the Escitalopram with the rare side effects of suicide ideation or is it my not taking clonazepam for one day? \n I knew clonazepam built up dependency, but is it that quickly??? \n\nI don\'t know the answers to any of those, but it was genuinely extremely scary.

I have asked 2 pharmacists roughly the same questions but looking for more confirmation from allergists/people who suffer from this\n\nContext:\nMy daughter was prescribed a 5 day course of amoxicillin for an ear and chest infection on 7th of Feb. She had 1 dose that evening, another dose in the morning (8th of feb) and one at lunch time. This is the first time she has needed an antibiotic. Upon bathing her, I noticed bruising to her ears (where the GP held them to look inside) and her feet and ankles began to swell with really quite blue bruising to the top, in between toes, ankles and sole of her feet. She very regularly grabs these areas and bashes her ankles together with force and kicks her feet off the ground while she is lying down. I took her straight to A&E in a worry as she has never had a bruise before and there was no possible way this could have been inflicted and she is not yet mobile.\nWhile in hospital, more bruising of different sizing appeared to the back of her calves, knee, elbow, top of her arm, veins at the palms of her hand and the vein behind one of knees in the crease. All these bruises appeared at different stages during the night and whenever a different nurse checked her over. She started to develop lots of little purple/red spots to her legs, her arms and knees started to swell and her eczema patches became very red. The bruising started off so blue that one of the nurses tried scrubbing it off thinking it was ink or dye from her clothes. She continued to grab and bash her feet and ankles together causing the bruises to become worse. There was absolutely no tenderness or pain where any of the bruises were. \nNumerous tests were done such as x-rays, CT, and an extensive blood test checking platelets, organ function etc. But nothing appeared on anything. The hospital continued to give her amoxicillin and I am unsure if any more bruising appeared. I saw her on day 6/7? (13th of feb) after taking the first dose and all bruising, spots and swelling had gone apart from little green-coloured areas where the bruising was on her veins. The whole of her face where she did not have eczema was peeling/flaking and had clearly been moisturised. I saw her again on 17th of feb and she had an untextured, really red rash consisting of lots of little spots covering her whole stomach which she had never had before. The skin on her face was also back to normal. \nThe dr never considered the amoxicillin. After researching myself and going into a pharmacy and requesting a leaflet that comes with amoxicillin, I am beginning to realise she may of had a very rare reaction or side effects to it - leaflet states all these symptoms as a 1 in 10,000 chance. \n\nQuestions:\n1. Does this sound like a reaction? Or side effects? I am unsure of the difference.\n2. Would these reactions/side effects alter any results on an extensive blood test?\n3. Can this allergy be found in a blood test if not looking for it?\n4. If this is an allergy, how can she be tested for it? (Skin prick, specific blood test, etc?)\n5. If she takes amoxicillin again, what are the chances she has the same reaction? \n6.Are drug allergy symptoms different every time? Or is there a risk of her going into anaphylaxis the next time she takes it?\n7. Would this be an allergy of penicillin or just amoxicillin? (If it is an allergy or just side effects)\n8. If not an allergy, is there any safe way to prove these are side effects of amoxicillin?\n9. Does the timeframe of doses of amoxicillin and the timeframe of the symptoms fit with a reaction?\n\nAnymore information you can think of regarding the situation would be highly appreciated.\nThank you for taking the time to read this very long post! Please help a desperate mother looking for answers.'"
antimicrobial,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcneScars/comments/t3hsb7/how_effective_is_aloe_vera_for_acne/,b'How Effective is Aloe vera for Acne?',,"b"" \n\nAcne is an extremely common problem among people of all ages, especially among teenagers and women going through menopause. It is embarrassing, it is frustrating, and it seems like it is never going to go away. While we may be able to control some of it depending on what we eat and what our stress levels are like, sometimes breakouts can appear without any warning. Luckily, there are many natural ingredients like Aloe Vera, which can help you reduce your breakouts and cure your acne-prone skin.\n\n## [Aloe Vera for Acne](https://biocule.com/bioedge/research/aloe-barbadensis-leaf-juice)\n\nAloe vera is a natural anti-inflammatory that can help reduce red marks left on the skin by acne. Aloe vera contains lignin, which improves the skin's ability to hydrate itself, promoting cell turnover and healthy tissue growth. Aloe vera also contains salicylic acid, which helps clear dead skin cells that clog pores.\n\nAcne scars will fade in time, but aloe vera may help speed up the process. The anti-inflammatory properties of [aloe vera for acne scars](https://biocule.com/bioedge/research/aloe-barbadensis-leaf-juice) reduce swelling and redness, while its antimicrobial properties kill bacteria that may be contributing to the infection of individual pimples as well as breakouts as a whole.\n\n## [How to Use Aloe Vera for Acne Scars?](https://biocule.com/bioedge/research/aloe-barbadensis-leaf-juice)\n\n**Apply Aloe Vera Directly on Acne Scars -** Extract fresh aloe vera gel from a leaf of the aloe vera plant and apply directly to the affected area. Leave it on for half an hour, then wash the gel off with water. Pat your face dry and apply a moisturizer to hydrate your skin. Repeat this twice daily for best results.\n\n**Aloe Vera Mask -** Squeeze half a lemon into a bowl. Add two tablespoons of aloe vera gel and one tablespoon of cinnamon powder to it. Mix it together to make a paste and apply it evenly to your face. Leave it for 20 minutes and wash it off with water.\n\nYou can also use honey and aloe vera. Honey is a natural antiseptic that helps in healing acne scars while cinnamon has anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce the appearance of scars."""

(with bonus rant)',,"b""Sciatica and hip impingement (possibly labral tear) for 9 months now. I get maybe 1 or 2 good days a week, the rest I suffer.  Feel free to skip over my rant and just jump to the end to offer advice. \n\nSo my common law husband has found out he's got cancer on his nose and needs surgery to remove it and do cosmetic repairs afterwards The surgery is in another province (we're in Canada) as it would take too long to see a surgeon here.  It's scheduled for April 10th.  It is an 7-8 hour drive if the weather is good. It is steep mountain passes and winding canyon road for about 2  hours of it so it could be longer if snowy. And I'll be doing the driving on my own for the return trip.  There's also a chance we'd have to go again a few weeks later to do follow up.  \n\nI'm struggling with sitting as it is, and lately walking has also become a problem.  \n\nBegin rant: Relationship wise we're also struggling (have been for a long time but hes probably unaware), because I've always been the bottom of his priority list behind his job and his grown-ass daughter. I know it's my fault for not sticking up for myself (the rest of my family has also taken advantage of me so he's not unique). \n\nFor context (feel free to skip this part):  When I was first hurt he left me at the hospital and wouldn't come back for me, I had to wake up my son who'd just come off a graveyard shift and lives a half hour away to come get me, because husband was too busy with work. Yet just a few months prior he had a gallbladder surgery and I left work to take him and stayed til they wheeled him in, and made sure I was back before they brought him back.  And early in our relationship I had to have surgery to get my tubes tied because I couldnt take birth control anymore, it was giving me severe migraines and my doc was afraid I'd  have a stroke. He refused to have a much easier vasectomy.  He also didnt want my kids calling him dad. And he's not been terribly supportive in helping me around the house either since ive been hurt (not even while he was laid off for the winter) I continued to shovel snow, sand the driveway, carry in wood for heat, clean the house, etc. So yeah, I'm not that important,  but when the tables are turned I'm always there for him, and I will be this time too. I do love him still regardless.  \n\nThere is another option.  An airport an hour away. The flight is only 45 minutes to the town we need to get to.  But he doesn't want to fly because his face will be all bandaged up.  I can truly understand this and sympathize with him, but if he were in pain I would be willing to fly for him even if I felt uncomfortable and self conscious. Heck, I'm sure he'd get all kinds of sympathy from the flight crew.  I just know if the tables were turned he would not drive me.  Hell, he probably wouldn't even go with me because it would mean missing work.\n\nSo all my emotional bagage and feeling sorry for myself aside, can anyone give me some advice on how to endure the drive? I can take pain meds for the drive there (I have opioids) as he'll be helping with the driving, but on the way back I can't take anything, and he's not going to want to stop anywhere public either.  I plan on taking some ice packs, some hot patches and some pain meds for when I'm not driving.  Tylenol and NSAIDs do nothing for me. I've tried half a dozen different useless cushions. What else can I do to make this less painful, or are there any pain meds that won't make me drowsy or high?  I am really hoping it won't be as bad as I think but I want to prepare for the worst."""

dilaudid,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/tuxzyl/help_my_dads_53m_condition_is_quickly_declining/,"b""Help - my dad's (53M) condition is quickly declining and I want to know if there is anything we could be missing (hepatic encephalopathy from liver cirrhosis + AS + delirium tremens)""",,"b"" My dad has been in the hospital for almost nine days and his condition is rapidly deteriorating. He first went to the ER after he was unable to sleep for five days straight, and complaining of a very bloated upset belly. He is an alcoholic (though was sober for six months last year, then started drinking again probably early fall) and in previous years, he abused prescription drugs like dilaudid. He also has a severe case of ankylosing spondylitis with many of the complications that often come along with the disease. So between his AS and alcoholism, on top of the fact that he doesn't eat or sleep much normally, he has not been in great health for quite some time. However, he has never really had any scares of liver failure previously. For what it's worth, he told me on the phone just before he went to the hospital that he felt like he was dying.\n\nThe doctors admitted him and began treating him for alcohol withdrawal and ran some tests and found that he had liver cirrhosis. His alcohol withdrawal was really rough and he quickly fell into a horrible case of delirium tremens, hallucinating and completely delirious (mentally he was relatively normal Thursday night when he was admitted, then on Friday he was already delirious). On top of that, the doctors think he has hepatic encephalopathy from liver cirrhosis so he has been completely out of it (mentally) for nine days. They've been treating him with lactulose for the encephalopathy and of course ativan for the withdrawal and severe agitation, and now have him on dilaudid because he has been writhing in pain for nine days straight. They're also treating him with antibiotics in case of any infection.\n\nFor the first six days, he would be awake and talking for much of the time but most of what he said wouldn't make sense; though he would vaguely respond to people at times. I wasn't able to visit him until he had been in the hospital six days, and at that point he was pretty bad and mumbling incoherently mostly but he responded to me when I asked if he knew who I was, and when I said I love you, he said I love you too. But it was hard to make out. Yesterday and today though, day nine, he is not responding to anyone at all, nor is he speaking or hardly even opening his eyes (when he does, the whites are very yellow). But he was writhing and moaning in pain despite the doctors giving him extraordinary amounts of ativan and some dilaudid too, plus he's on methadone. They've had him restrained and laying almost flat for about eight days and his lungs started accumulating liquid. On a good day, my dad experiences incredible amounts of pain from his AS and I know laying in a bed for days straight would absolutely destroy his back so I'm sure that's much of the reason he's in so much pain.\n\nThe doctors were hoping his withdrawal-induced delirium and confusion would clear up naturally within 5-7 days, but they haven't and he is only getting worse (unable to speak now and unresponsive). His stomach is extremely bloated but upon taking an ultrasound of my dad's belly, apparently there's not a ton of fluid built up but actually quite a bit of air. The doctors are stumped as to why the air build up. Since his condition is only getting worse, the doctors decided it's best to run some test to rule everything out but the only way to run these tests are to intubate him and sedate him heavily because he squirms around in pain and can't hold still otherwise. So, they have him intubated and sedated right now, and also propped up so he's not laying on his back (he looks so much more comfortable and peaceful now as opposed to the entire week before where he was just writhing in pain all day). They ran a CT scan today and will have the results tomorrow, and will also do a spinal tap and MRI. I will note that his vitals are pretty good and he did have one small fever since being there, but nothing major.\n\nBasically I'm wondering and at this point begging anyone who knows anything if there is something the doctors might be missing? If they don't find anything after running these tests, it's just going to be a matter of keeping him as comfortable as possible as he dies a slow death, completely unresponsive and basically unconscious. He is only 53. Does this all sound like simply hepatic encephalopathy, and if so, can that actually kill a person so suddenly even though they had no major warning signs before (that I know of, anyway)? If it is HE, what should we expect for the last few days of his life to look like, and how long would we expect until he were to pass away? Is it still possible that he might recover even though things have only gotten worse, if it is HE? Is there something the doctors can do that they aren't currently doing/treating him for? I'm so devastated especially since he's clearly in so much pain when he's not heavily sedated and he's not even aware of what's going on around him. It's like his entire existence this past nine days is pain, with no awareness of anything except for pain. And that fucking kills me. I just want to talk to my dad again and tell him how much he means to me and know that he's hearing it. I want to hear him say he loves me at least one more time.

I want to have people around me and feel loved, and cared for, and valued, but I also just can\'t stand being around people. Same problem with always wanting physical contact. It\'s like why can\'t we just have a full conversation that\'s deep and meaningful and makes me feel cared for while being held by someone that loves me, but at the same time not have anyone else in the room or even earshot of me. I really hate talking to people. \n\nI\'m always scared of every thing and it limits my ability to do things including leaving the house or in some cases my bedroom. And the depression is so bad I just kind of always want to give up just a little literally all the time. \n\nI get angry or annoyed easily and sometimes I just have these little outbursts that I can\'t control and don\'t remember. Not like violent or crossing a line. But like a teenager yelling ""you don\'t care about me!"" When they\'re feeling overwhelmed. Which I guess is just me feeling overwhelmed kind of always. \n\nMy girlfriend of about a year and a half and I have been kind of drifting apart lately, In the sense that were always arguing about something stupid, usually her mom being unfair to us. She just kind of wants to deal with it but her mom always says things to target me. And I can\'t control it I just start shit. The other night she told her mom we were arguing and she was considering ending the relationship. Her mom jumped on board and they had a long talk about why she should. This is shortly after the mom banned me from the house for texting her when she\'d be home so I knew if we could go to my sister\'s rehearsal dinner or not. I was overly polite. Her mom is now making her feel uncomfortable for choosing not to break up with me. \n\nI\'m also not entirely sure she\'s really not going to break up with me, things have been different between us since her mom started making her feel uncomfortable. But I have a hard time with intrusive thoughts so I have no idea if it\'s really her mom, or her, or why she\'s even trying to stay with me. And talking to her about it is difficult, mostly because she\'s stressed and doesn\'t want to. I\'m trying to get her some space but it\'s just so hard, especially knowing her only housemate is against our relationship and vocal about it.\n\nI can\'t stand being alone. This is unrelated to the girlfriend. I just can\'t take being by myself or the idea that one day I\'ll be living on the streets with no way to support myself because of my mental health. I have a cat, her name is Beetle. Beetle is the only thing that really brings me any joy in life these days. I don\'t get along with my family. I\'m ruining my one real human connection. I don\'t have a job or hobbies to bring me any joy and I just can\'t manage to bring myself to do or stay with any activity. And Ive had jobs before, but since COVID and the stress of some new family developments, my mental health is so bad I don\'t know if I can hold down a job. Made worse by my last job, I was fired for not wanting to make outbound sales calls, which as an analyst was outside the scope of my position anyway.\n\nI\'ve tried therapy many times and I know the root of many of my problems, but not how to fix it them. And I\'ve yet to find a therapist who can help with that. I\'ve also been on many medications. I take Adderall and Ambien daily currently, but I\'ve been on SSRIs and antianxiety meds in the past with very little success.\n\nI\'m not ""looking for a way out"". But I just feel so trapped and bad all the time. The constant need to feel not alone, but the inability and distain for talking to people. The fact I can\'t just happy, always spiralling from any intrusive thought, even stuff that doesn\'t matter. I just ruin everything I touch and idk if I can even really feel bonds with people. I\'m stuck. I can\'t do anything. And I just don\'t want to feel this way anymore.\n\nThank you for letting me vent, and please, if you have any suggestions or thoughts, let me know.

I'm a 28-year old woman with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PTSD, and, since contracting COVID in May 2022, POTS, a condition that causes a racing heartbeat, heart palpitations, and chest pain upon standing. For several months now, I've been on a medication that very effectively controls my POTS symptoms, which is why I was very puzzled when I began to experience chest pain again in the last couple of months. My cardiologist increased my dosage of the medication but that's had zero effect, leading me to believe that the cause isn't cardiac-related, especially since said medication was originally created to treat heart failure-related chest pain. I also saw a gastroenterologist, but that was similarly unhelpful to resolving the problem.\n\nNow, I'm wondering if it could be related to my anxiety, which, tbf, has been through the roof for some months now due to the whole long COVID thing, plus general work stress. For that reason, I'd like to hear about some of your experiences with anxiety-related chest pain. Specifically, if you could answer these three questions, I'd really appreciate it!\n\n1. What does your chest pain feel like? How would you describe the sensation (i.e., burning, bruise-like, muscle soreness, spasms, etc)?\n2. When do you feel chest pain? Is it only in response to triggers or other stressful stimulus, or do you feel it randomly even when you aren't actively anxious?\n3. Where do you feel the pain on your chest? Which side/elevation? Is it always in the same place or does it tend to switch spots?\n\nFor me, it's sometimes a burning pain and sometimes a bruise-like soreness. It happens randomly throughout the day no matter what I'm doing, but happens more often and more severely when I'm stressed or anxious. It seems to be in a different place every time, sometimes happening on the left or right side, sometimes near my collar bone and sometimes at the bottom of my ribcage, but oftentimes seems to happen around my heart. Or maybe I just notice those times more because they freak me out more, who knows!\n\nIf anyone else could share their experience, I'd be very grateful!"""

I woke up that day extremely dizzy and nauseous, vomited twice, and had some diarrhea. The dizziness (spinning, like vertigo), lasted another two days, though no more vomiting. It started to get a bit better, and then the dizziness rapidly shifted feeling - from spinning to rocking, as if I was on a boat. I was taking Gravol to control the ensuing nausea (as I am already quite prone to motion sickness). Initially I was unable to read or look at a computer, but I was able to lie down and watch mindless TV. These symptoms gradually abated after about 7 weeks.\n\nDuring this time I went to see two ENTs and a neurologist, and had an MRI (on August 27th, found to be normal). After describing my symptoms, I was diagnosed with vestibular neuritis rather than vestibular migraines (that was a concern, as I am generally prone to migraines, though never before have I experienced something of this nature), since I was not experiencing headaches during this time.\n\nAt my last appointment with my ENT on September 20th, the doctor had me lie down with my head hanging over the edge of the table to test how I felt. I immediately felt nauseous, and when I went home I wasnt feeling well and I went to sleep. I woke up and felt quite intense pressure in my neck and at the top left side of my head.\n\nSince this time I have had these odd pressure-pain headaches almost every day. They travel around, generally beginning at the base of my skull, to follow along to either the top left or right of my head, and often concentrate near my temples (above my ear). At first I thought they might be tension headaches, but I also feel tenderness around the areas where the pain is, and its been weeks that Ive had these symptoms now. Neither regular Advil, Tylenol, nor Voltaren/Naproxen alleviate the pain, and Im starting to worry that theres something wrong.\n\nI have also had some jaw pain on-and-off since August, and although this might be potentially unrelated, I have had symptoms of costichondritis as well as soreness around the joints in my arms and my lower legs since early September.\n\nI am getting quite anxious, and I do not know what to do - I know what normal headaches and migraines feel like, and these arent them. Does anyone have any ideas? Should I consider getting another MRI, considering the headache symptoms started about a month after the initial dizziness (and thus after my first - and only - MRI)?\n\nThank you.'"

For those of you who are curious, Biperiden is an anticholinergic commonly used for Parkinson's Disease and it's also one of the few euphoric anticholinergic deleriants there is much like Trihexyphenidyl (Artane) and Biperiden is a popular drug of abuse in Greece where it's used as a substitute for Trihexyphenidyl and occasionally combined with alcohol and Cannabis. I chose to do a trip report on this combo because anticholinegic deliriants enhance the visuals from Zolpidem and ive combined Zolpedim with other anticholinergics like Cyclobenzaprine and Amitriptyline and have had intense trips with those combos and saw shadow people and the works. \n\nSome facts about me, I weigh 160 pounds (approximately 72.6 kilograms) and I take 300 milligrams of Pregabalin (Lyrica) a day for fibromyalgia and 16 milligrams of Suboxone a day for opioid dependence I developed using opioids to manage my fibro pain because Pregabalin barely works and my pain management doctor sucks ass. I'm also prescribed 2 milligrams of Eszopiclone (Lunesta) for sleep and I can't remember the last time I used it as it shares a cross tolerance with Zolpidem and Zaleplon. Now without further adieu here's the trip report.\n\n1:50 AM, Took 5 milligrams of Biperiden (the typical deliriant dose of Biperiden is 10 milligrams) on an empty stomach.\n\n2:05 AM, Took the last 20 milligrams of Zolpedim from my old script on an empty stomach.\n\n2:30 AM, I'm feeling a warm flash throughout my body which is the Biperiden's doing, other anticholinergic drugs have similar effects. I'm also feeling the calmness from the Ambien coming up as well.\n\n2:50 AM, Thing's seem brighter and my vision is blurry as fuck despite taking out my contacts and putting them back in. I'm tempted to redose 5 more milligrams of Biperiden to to reach a full blown trip as I figured this combo would be more intense than my 10 milligram Amitripyline and 20 milligram Zolpidem trip. so far I just feel super calm and the visuals aren't as intense as I thought or would like them to be.\n\n2:55 AM,  Redosed another 5 milligrams of Biperiden thus bringing me up to 10 milligrams of Biperiden and 20 milligrams of Zolpidem. Time to get wonkier than Willy Wonka, ;D Fire up the clown car Lando I'm coming to visit. :D\n\n5:45 AM I don't remember much what happened in between in the time from 3:00 AM to now although I vaguely remember it had me walking around like a drunken zombie me and I watched South Park and I listened to the songs Disclosure and Esoteric Agenda by The HAARP Machine (music sounded pretty nice on this combo). Also the walls were breathing, the letters on my phone's keyboard were moving around and the emoji's took on a 3D texture, and the paintings in my grandparents house were moving around which was pretty cool I guess, my vision is still blurry as fuck which I found made trying to type and and reply to messages pretty difficult considering the letters looked weird on my screen and were wiggling around or looked quite different. I'm about to go to sleep and update when I wake up.\n\n12:00 PM I wake up and still feel some residual effects from the Biperiden like dry mouth, dilated pupils, and a mild calm feeling that wasn't as intense as last night (it has an elimination half life of 18 hours so I suppose residual effects from a 10 milligram dose is indeed a possibility).\n\nAll in all i'd say this was an interesting  combination I may repeat in the future when I get my hands on more Zolpedim. Oddly enough I didnt see shadow people on this combo... o.O However this combo seemed to become more amnesiac after taking 10 milligrams of Biperiden but with a 5 milligram dose of Biperiden it was quite calming, anxiolytic, and has a mild euphoria to it. Anyways that was my experience with this combination, I hope everyone enjoys reading this."""

Everytime I think things are getting better, they just come crashing down again. \n\n I\'m 19F, healthy, no medical conditions, no diabetes, not overweight (in fact I\'m probably underweight which I\'ll get to), normal stats, healthy homemade food, no drugs/alc, no caffeine, play lots of sports .. However, since coming to college, things really haven\'t been the same. I found out that I had an H. Pylori infection literally at the beginning of freshman year, and that was absolutely brutal. I won\'t go into detail here about it but it served as what I think was one of the worst depressive episodes of my life. I couldn\'t eat, I\'d get anxiety and panic attacks because of the continuous discomfort I felt, and hence the intense weight loss (still haven\'t been able to regain those pounds). Even after the treatment (its been a year), I do not feel as I did before the infection. Definitely, my self confidence, motivation, and drive have plummeted since then and I\'m constantly on edge about my body. It\'s like I\'m hypersensitive about every little thing happening inside, and even if one thing gets off track, it makes me so anxious. \n\n   I was trying so desperately to get back to normal, whatever that means. I just do not have the energy to stress over my body. I\'m only 19! I\'d much rather be stressed over my grades tbh. \n\n  This recent year\'s anxiety + the pandemic + my life at home (not the most welcoming environment I\'d say)  probably points to the years-long stress I\'ve been experiencing. Recently, my mind\'s found a new thing to worry about. \n\n A few weeks ago, when I was heading back to campus (we were driving), I had to pee. This sensation was normal - it was your usual ""pee in the next 20 min pls"" sign. However, we kept driving, and it just seemed like endless miles of residential area. 10 - 15 minutes passed. I was squirming in my seat and told my dad to hurry up otherwise.. We finally came across a chain of stores and we stopped. Even now, the pressure was bearable enough. We went into the grocery store, and just my luck, someone was already in the singular bathroom they had. This is where my panic rose intensely and all the anxious feelings started bombarding my mind.  i walked to the stores nearby urgently, searching for a bathroom. It was another 7 minutes of pure agony. \n\n*""I need to pee now or I\'ll pee my pants in front of everyone ""* \n\n It was utterly horrible and I thought this was it - I was gonna pee my pants. I was gonna lose control. The social anxiety and just constant overthinking definitely made my urgency way worse - I could practically feel my bladder screaming. Finally, FINALLY, I found the bathroom at Smart n Final and practically sprinted inside and relieved myself. \n\n It felt great, and the rest of the day I was fine. I thought this was gonna be an isolated event. But, later that week when I had to come back via bus for an appointment at home, it happened again. I wasn\'t able to pee before I got on the bus (a 1ish hour ride) because the public restrooms near the station was closed !!! just my luck. Also, I knew for a fact that I didn\'t have that much water in me - I peed like an hour ago anyways. Nevertheless, I got on the bus for the worst bus ride I\'ve ever experienced. 5 minutes into sitting down, I felt my anxiety creeping up, telling me I should\'ve peed before. The same urgency I had experienced started again. I crossed my legs but i don\'t know if that helped too much. The stress was so intense, I again thought i was gonna pee onto the seat. I really tried distracting myself, deep breathing, looking out the window to focus on something else, but the unbearable urgency was still there. I don\'t know how I held on for that long - when I got off the bus, I ran to a nearby public restroom and emptied my bladder - which was not even half full.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think these 2 core experiences, combined with the habit I have with preemptive voiding, really did a number on me. Should I also add the week of violent coughing I had after the flu shot? Ever since, I don\'t know if I\'ve hurt my bladder or my pelvic muscles or if its really just in my head. There\'s been a lot of urge frequency and burning at the urethra tip. Went and got a urine culture done - no sign of a UTI. Before these results came, my GP did prescribe some nitrofurantoin (macrobid) for my symptoms, but i don\'t think much has changed. I still am experiencing frequency which gets much worse in social settings (which is why I don\'t go out too much because where am I gonna find a bathroom 11 minutes into my morning run). There\'s still some burning at my urethra sometimes, and I\'m so sick of this. Attended class today and all I could think about was how I didn\'t know where the nearest bathroom was - needless to say I had to get up and leave half and hour into class to find the bathroom and relieve an almost empty bladder.\n\n I\'ve been drinking a lot of water the past few weeks, no blood in urine (common for renal failure + STDs), no pain while urinating, no stabbing bladder pain (common for OAB), but there\'s been a fair amount of discharge. I\'ve seriously considered so many options like OAB (overactive bladder), IC (interstitial cystitis), yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis, weakened pelvic floor, STDS (which is not a possibility because I have not touched a man :), and even prolapse. I told my GP that the antibiotics didn\'t do much and I was the one who suggested maybe it\'s a yeast infection? GP told me ""it\'s a possibility"" and to take monistat. How is it that I\'m putting forth all the possible diagnoses? How are you telling me to take a medication with no clear diagnosis?? Why would I treat a YI if you haven\'t tested for it??? It\'s like shooting in the dark, but with your health. \n\n I\'m going insane trying to curb this problem, and I\'m sure I\'ve got full blown health anxiety. I just feel so old, constantly worrying about a knee that creaks or a back that pains. Worrying about bladder issues. Sadness fills my mind when I watch people walking around with no care in the world. ""*Do they have to pee as bad as I do all the time? Do they worry like I do? Do they have issues like I do?*""\n\nIt sounds silly but comparison is inevitable. Also, if you\'ve made it this far into my story, thanks for listening really. I make all my friends laugh and feel happy when I do, but I haven\'t been able to do the same for myself. My parents generally brush off my concerns (I\'ve got asian parents :P) and I don\'t feel close enough with any of my friends to truly discuss.  I don\'t know if this is a stress issue, a physical issue, or both (probably). I really don\'t want it to be chronic - I feel that I\'ve tried too hard to take care of my health for this to happen.\n\nI will visit my doctor once again, after I\'ve tested myself for YIs etc. Because I believe you can\'t come close to curing a problem without having a diagnosis! I\'ll continue to do kegels too, as well as mindfulness. If you\'re suffering from a similar problem, please know that you\'re not alone (I know this is oversaid but it makes a world of difference). It\'s hard to *fix* our bodies when something goes wrong, but our body is really the only thing we have full control and jurisdiction over in our lives (hopefully). You will get better.'"

influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/n66k5h/just_had_my_second_vaccine/,b'Just had my second vaccine!',,"b""I was due to have my second vaccine on Sunday 16th May, but it got brought forward by 10 days. Bit of a pain to have plans changed, but it actually benefitted me for some reason. Drove to the hospital where it was to be done, parking in a nearby supermarket so as to avoid the extortionate hospital parking charges (they're a major sticking point for a lot of people in the UK, which is where I live). Walked in, and the direction signs to the vaccination clinic pointed in a different direction to the first vaccine, but it meant a shorter route to & from the clinic. Surprisingly, there was quite a queue, and phone signal was poor, so I just had to deal with it.\n\nEventually got checked in, and had to wait a short while for a cubicle to be available so I could go in for the vaccine. Was called in not long after, and after a few questions, I rolled my T-shirt sleeve up and got the vaccine (Pfizer, if anyone's interested). Felt the needle go in more than I did the first time, but it was still relatively painless. And hey - I've coped in the past with getting a tattoo (albeit a rather small one, though I do want a couple more which are quite a bit larger), so a vaccine's not much of a big deal! Had to sit and wait for 15 minutes afterwards, but no immediate side-effects presented themselves, so I was free to go home. Also got a 'brave boy' sticker (as the nurse who gave me the vaccine put it), and even though I'm a 28-year-old man, I couldn't exactly say no to that!\n\nI'd been sensible and bought a sugary drink & snack from the supermarket before going for the vaccine just in case, but I don't think I really needed them. Still, I definitely deserved a treat, I think. Also ended up getting lunch from McDonald's, because why not? Didn't fancy putting too much effort into cooking after having a vaccine! Overall, I somehow had no issues with sensory overload at all, and somehow didn't get too stressed with the longer-than-expected wait prior to being vaccinated and the poor mobile phone reception meaning I was slightly bored while waiting. Just over two hours after the vaccine, I'm feeling fine, though I'm not exactly looking forward to any side-effects while at work tonight. I've got painkillers in my bag (which can come in quite useful if needed), and I know to stay hydrated as well. This won't be a problem, as I have easy access to drinks at work. What's a bigger miracle is I managed to get out of bed and go to the hospital without my parents needing to intervene (they're currently away for a few days, so I'm home alone for a bit, which I don't mind).\n\nThe important thing to remember is the vaccine doesn't just benefit me. It benefits everyone else as well, especially those who are immunocompromised or can't have the vaccine for other reasons (those who are young, for example), and helps reduce the burden on the NHS. The sooner we all get vaccinated, the sooner things will be able to start returning to how they used to be. I have to admit I'm kinda dreading it a bit, but it'll be good to finally be able to go about life without as many restrictions. Most of all, I'm looking forward to seeing my boyfriend in two weeks' time for the first time since August. That's seriously overdue."""
acetaminophen,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/xg02mz/mystery_tooth_pain_dentist_is_stumped_doesnt_show/,"b'Mystery tooth pain? Dentist is stumped, doesnt show up on x-rays'",,"b'M 22. Potentially worth noting I have a narrow pallete but only crowding on my lower jaw. Braces years ago, no retainer, my top teeth are still very straight.\n\nI describe the pain as a deep ache, it comes and goes. Sometimes its a 2/10 sometimes its a 6/10, sometimes its not there. It is not sensitive to anything specific (read what my dentist did below). Sometimes my lip tingles but its rare. It is localized in the first top left molar but sometimes travels to the ones behind it.\n\nI take both ibuprofen and acetaminophen occasionally, only the ibuprofen helps with the pain, and only very slightly (like not even worth taking a pill level of relief)\n\nSo timeline:\n\nAbout 2 years ago I started to get a bit of discomfort on my upper left side near my first and sometimes second molars. It was super occasional and extremely mild so I didnt think much of it (I know I know, bad of me).\n\nAfter about a year, it was getting more noticeable and frequent. In february (2022) I noticed my wisdom teeth were coming in (felt one poking through) and my whole jaw on that side would ache similarly to how this feels, so I assumed that was the cause of my discomfort. I saw my dentist who referred me to my oral surgeon, and at that time I mentioned my tooth. Because of money issues we could not x-ray it, and he said we would take a proper look at it when we can.\n\nI saw my oral surgeon in March. We took an x-ray, I did in fact need my wisdom teeth out. I had 1 impacted upper one in my RIGHT side, the left one (pain side) was vertical as it should be. I mentioned my painful tooth. He said he sees nothing on his x-ray, but its not the same kind as the one the dentist gives me.\n\nIn May I had my surgery (I had to wait because I had to save money). At this point my tooth was aching a lot as I described above. The surgery went very well. After the surgery, I had 4 dry sockets and a mild infection in the lower left. I went back and my surgeon did another x-ray, confirmed the infection, and gave me another round of amox which in fact cleared it up.\n\nIn June I saw my dentist again because during my surgery they knocked a filling off of my bottom left second molar. At this time I was healed but my holes were still open. I mentioned my tooth still hurts, and asked if they would look at the new x-rays my surgeon took after my surgery because I still could not afford ones from them. They called for a fax and got them within a few minutes, pulled them up, explained to me again how they were different than their regular x-rays, and then to the best of their ability confirmed they saw nothing abnormal.\n\n**At this point my tooth pain is almost constant and really hard to ignore. Its there from the moment I wake up until I go to bed, only occasionally letting up randomly through the day. It makes my bottom jaw tremble.**\n\nYesterday I saw my dentist for an oral exam and cleaning. I told him my tooth was still hurting and I think it must be a bad cavity. They did x-rays on my whole mouth and I do have some very small cavities that shouldnt be hurting mebut not in these teeth. He showed me my x-rays and explained what he looks for and how these teeth are perfectly healthy. He did some tests on these teeth, knocking them with tools, scratching, cold air, cold water, a weird icy gel. Nothing increased the pain. He asked me about sweet foods and I said no increase of pain. He poked at my closed wisdom holes and pressed all around my pallete and gums and even around my uvula. He asked me if I had sinus issues and I said no so he had me stand up and touch my toes to see if the pressure makes it hurt more but it made no difference. He said my gum seemed very healthy too. Ive never seen bewilderment in a medical professionals eyes so I started to get worried. He told me he has no idea why it hurts, it shouldnt hurt.\n\nHes told me to talk to my family doctor about checking my sinuses, which I am going to do, but I dont think its my sinus. Its a deep ache within the tooth and gum area, on the outside more than the inside.\n\nJust wondering if anyone has any other ideas on what it could be, as it didnt show up on either x-ray. Im really suffering here! Ouch!!!'"

Need some help here.'",,"b""I had to stop my second course of Isotreitonin (30gr for roughly 1 month) because of some bad side effects like diarrhea, abdominal/muscle pain, depression and loss of libido. It's now 1 month I stopped and I still experience this:\n\n-Bad back pain, which gets a lot worse when I sit\n-A feeling of numbness/tickling in my legs, hips, thighs and butt. I feel weakness in my lower muscles, I have difficult standing still some days, especially when I wake up\n-Still very poor libido and erectile dysfunction. There's very little activity down there since I took this pill and still going on. Can't get hard 70% of times even if I masturbate. Max I can get is some soft erections that really don't feel normal. Plus I feel this constant discomfort/tingling in my prepuce area. I'm not really fucntional right now. I take 5mg Cialis and does better, but even with that I have some difficult getting one good hard on. Things are not normal for real.\n-The worst anxiety and mood swings I've ever had in all my life. I pass from crying to feel better from one day to the other. I think my actual sexual problems play a huge role on this. Honestly, I cannot feel good mentally if my comrade doesn't work at 21 yo.\n-Brain fog and feeling tired constantly. More like an hopeless, only want to sleep thing. Just I don't feel like myself, you know?\n-Since I had diarrhea while on the pills, after I stopped them, it's 1 month I'm constipated. Like, I can't take a shit if at least 2 or 3 days don't pass. Before, I took a dump almost 2 times a day. I also feel this dull pain in my lower abdomen in the left, I think may have colitis, but it's strange to me it goes on for almost a month. I didn't took any drug for It, because it usually goes away by his own when I get It.\n\nThis Is pretty much all, I'm having a really hard time at the Moment, especially from a mental side. I don't know anymore if these symptoms are gonna subside or ruin me forever. I just don't feel myself anymore like this. Obviously, my sexual problems are what is giving me the most distress. In one month I passed from masturbating 2 times a day at struggling to even get it up.\nI took the drug for almost a month and after these side effects appeared, I instantly stopped. But this was my second course, I did another one 3 years ago of 4 months with the same dosage and nothing bad happened, a part from some dryness and fatigue. It's 1 month now I stopped and all these side effects are lasting. What's your idea on this? Did you also experience similar lasting side effects for months, also after stopping the pill? Will they subside with time? Any sexual related problems? I'm freaking out bad for this. I can't think of being not sexually functional for the rest of my life and I can't bare anymore this numbness and discomfort I have in my body. Also these mood swings are killing my daily productivity, almost lost my job for this. Really need some advice on this or your experience with it. My doc said these can't give sexual related problems and that this side effects usually subsides few weeks after stopping the treatment. But here I am, 1 month after, still half broken. Also saw an andrologist, said my blood flow is regular and made me do blood work for hormones, will have the response in few days. Will also have another blood work on 30th to check my general health."""

I'm bipolar II, have been diagnosed for twp years, and have been managing pretty well. I'm back in school after years of putting it off, and now I am killing it. I've never been happier. I've got great relationships in my life that have allowed me to be myself and build upon all the good things in my life, like academics, finances, and emotional well-being. I'm going into healthcare, and so I needed a few vaccinations and a TB test for which I always test positive because I was vaccinated for TB when I was a child. So we take a chest X-ray to rule out any issues, and then you're clear to work in a healthcare setting. However, my chest X-ray showed a granuloma (necrotic tissue which has now healed, preventing an infection). Infection from what? Tuberculosis. The same TB I was vaccinated for as a child.   Anyway, I was told I needed to take an antibiotic called isoniazid and had my lung specialist tell me one thing about existing medications and my p-doc telling me another. I went with my p-doc who told me to drop my anti-depressants for the time I'm on the antibiotic. Isoniazid is known to give people hallucinations/psychosis, so the added serotonin from my SSRI might cause a stroke. Ok, so I'm glad I stopped the anti-depressant. But I went cold turkey. So at a relatively high dose of the SSRI, I went to 0 to start the antibiotic. And it went terribly.   I ended up having a day where my heart rate went from 75 (my standard) to 142 bpm. My blood pressure went from 120/70 on a Monday, to 170/110 on a Saturday. I kept feeling like I was in danger, but it was only a feeling, and there were no ideations. I recognized that something was wrong with my medications, and I needed to get some help with my blood pressure. Making things worse, I had a date on Saturday and had to cancel because I didn't want to show up like that.   Its been a few days, but my blood pressure and heart rate are still elevated, and now I'm on clonazepam to help with anxiety. It's such a small dose that it's doing nothing other than letting me have a poop once in a while.    I just feel like there are so many variables moving right now in my body, that I'm scared out of my mind that something like this could happen again and I won't have any support to get through it. My best friends were both out of town, and one, I'm not sure I can really depend on anymore.   I am thankful that I have the ability to check my blood pressure and take myself to the emergency room, but really, I got no help there other than a couple of blood pressure readings and blood tests. I'm normal.   So did I freak out over the date? The medication? Or all of the above? I'm just trying to understand how because things were going so well a month ago; they have gone to this point.

influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/dtuvrf/im_conflicted_about_my_aba_treatment/,"b""I'm conflicted about my ABA treatment.""",,"b'(apologies for the throwaway account, I\'m a bit nervous posting about it).\n\nSo, I\'ve been a longer time lurker of r/aspergers for quite a while, and see it as a forum where I can see issues surrrouding the autistic spectrum, and it\'s refreshing to hear other perspectives on issues. But, I have been looking at what people around this subreddit about Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) and feel very conflicted. I hear articles on it\'s abuse, it\'s mistreatment of otherwise healthy individuals. I\'ll tell you my story behind ABA:\n\nI was diagnosed with moderate Autism around when I was two during visitis towards a GP. I recall my parents being scared at this time, telling me doctors painted a picture that ""I would not learn to speak at all."" I was recommended treatment towards Applied Behaviour Analysis by our local General Practitioner at the age of 4 for treatment.\n\nMy expierence with Applied Behaviour Analysis was neutral. In terms of the hours, it was long 40hr week (I\'m not exact on the hours) sessions, with training split towards social behaviour learning (eye-contact,  understanding facial expressions), speech therapy (in particular, trouble pronouncing certain teeth heavy letters) and in some cases introduction of food (I had case of  Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder). It took up large amounts of time in my childhood, feeling somewhat restricted by my treatment circumstances. It felt kind of reptitive, having to do simple tasks in exchange for a shiny car ( or some other kind of positive reinforcement) At the same time, I never felt I had any abuse with all of my ABA therapists and remember fondly of kind, warm treatment from them.\n\nI felt like in some ways ABA made it that I could have a ""normal"" lifestyle. I could socialise more easily and recognise my friends feelings, helping me forge friends that I can call on until this day. Being able to speak more from some ABA assisted speech therapy can mean I can speak my mind clearly. Treatment for my restrictive food intake disorder using ABA technqiues meant that I could eat a much healther diet (my fear of eating new foods meant that I would have vitamin definciences, and lead towards significant health issues). I can say that the therapy helped me.\n\nBut, I don\'t want feel that I am this ""other"" that has to be normalised. Even with me hiding my symptoms of autism towards my friends, I had signifcant abuse and mistreatment for my peers during my school years. Constant condencing attitudes, being forced to dance in front of my peers. Having been told constantly to just ""kill yourself"" by one bastard. Having an entire adminstration constantly talk down to me as if I\'m intellectually disabled freak. I spent a majority of my childhood walking alone in the playground, misreable and without any friends. This ""normalisation"" that ABA implictly promised  never came, and I always felt alien, even to the friends and family that loved me. This leaves me with self-esteem issues that I still deal with to this day, if I\'m worth as a person. Trying to fit in as a neurotypical left me depressed, anxious and felt lacking a personality that I had to deal with for decades.\n\nAt the same time, I saw innocent kids and their scared parents being taken by psuedoscientific bullshit. Children given crystal therapy in order to cure their autism. Chuck them into ""dolphin therapy"" where someone the swimming with a dolphin. The ""gluten free"" diet bullshit. And I haven\'t forgotten Dr Wakefields utter medical fraud that was the MMR Vaccine Autism Study, leading towards a paranoia against autism. All these bullshit therapy and charlatans left these people without a proper, realistic method of trying to better ourselves. I\'m not sure if their exists any other therapies that can help us adapt towards a hostile NT world. There needs to be a legitmate avenue for treatment, that we all agree treats us with dignity. \n\nFor those who wondering what the main conflict with ABA is, it\'s that it\'s both the treatment that let me express myself in society comapred to the both explicit reports of abuse on r/aspergers and implict cookie cutter that we must jump through towards being the dreaded ""normal"" individual. On the one hand, there\'s a part of me who wants recognises that ABA was crucial to developing vital social skills towards communicating in a NT dominated society. The people who treated me treated me well, but I\'m not sure if that\'s the case today for most individuals. But, I\'m not sure that it prepares us to accept ourselves as people deserving respect and dignity.\n\nI want to hear your responses.'"

Im using a ResMed Airsense 10 and I have a Phillips Dreamwear Nasal Mask with Pillows. My pressures were originally set from 5-15 but I adjusted them to 5-20 since I thought that would make a difference with my fatigue. My EPR was set to off and my humidity level was at 1. My ramp was also set to off and my response was set to Soft. I get about 10 hours of sleep every night, I take 1 mg of melatonin at night and occasionally 10-30 mg of Doxepin if Im having a hard time sleeping. On the ResMed My Air app, I usually get a score of 100 with a 20/20 for mask seal. I usually dont wake up during the night unless I have to pee and when that happens, I fall right back to sleep.\n\nEven though Ive started Cpap therapy, I still feel dead tired. Its to the point where I can barely get out of bed. No amount of caffeine, sleep, exercise, sunlight or diet changes help. Yesterday, I had an appointment with my sleep doctor and I asked her a ton of questions like if I need a Bipap instead, if I can be prescribed a stimulant and if I should be tested for hypersomnia. She said she wont consider prescribing me a stimulant until Ive used the CPAP for 3 months and that theres no advice she can give on how to solve the fatigue. She said my pressure settings were too high and that they should be from 5-10 since Im only having about 1 apnea event per hour with the cpap according to Resmed My Air. She also said I should have my EPR set to 2 since it can help reduce snoring and my humidity level should be at 3 or higher. I made those changes to my CPAP machine but I still feel awful.\n\nI started using the Oscar software and noticed that my AHIs and central sleep apnea events were getting higher even with the CPAP. I also have been dealing with worsening fatigue, insomnia and waking up after only a couple of hours of sleep. I made a post on Sleep Apnea Board and was told I could have treatment emergent central sleep apnea. I called my sleep doctor but the soonest I can see her is June 22nd, I am on a cancellation list though.\n\nI was told to try sleeping at a fixed high pressure with EPR off and see if that helps so I did that for a night with the pressure being 7. When I woke up and analyzed my data, it says I had Cheyne Stokes Respiration of 4.22%. Im absolutely terrified now because I heard the most common cause is heart failure. Im 54 ft and 210 lbs so I definitely could have that. Ive lost a lot of weight this year though and I plan on keeping it up.\n\nI sent a message to my PCP, respiratory therapist and plan on calling my sleep doctor on Monday. My respiratory therapist called me and told me to go back to having my pressures being 5-10 for now and hell call me on Monday to discuss.\n\nAm I dying?! I am completely terrified right now and crying my eyes out. What should my next steps be? I already asked my doctor in my email to her tonight if I should see a cardiologist, are there specific tests that I should ask her for? I'm also currently trying to get my insurance (Medicaid) to let me do another sleep test to see if I have treatment emergent central apneas but if I do, it'll take fucking months to get an ASV covered by them. Should I keep my pressures from 5-10? I'm completely panicking rn."""

Who wants to help me solve my medical mystery from over a decade ago?',,"b'Buckle up, because this one is a doozy. About 12 years ago I had some kind of medical event that literally no one has ever given me a concrete answer on and I STILL hate that I never got closure. Maybe you guys can help me out? \n\n**The Story:**\n\n>**December 2010:** I went to piano lessons in the early afternoon.  \n>  \n>That morning, I think I had gotten into a fight/argument with my sister and out of frustration was hitting my head backwards against the wall, not enough to cause even a small amount of pain and certainly no bruising/etc. I think I did this maybe 3 times. (I just remember wondering later that week if that was why this all happened. It stuck with me.)  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>At piano lessons, everything proceeded as usual.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>At some point during the lesson--not sure when--It felt like I couldn\'t understand the sheet music anymore. I was just staring at it, but it didn\'t make sense the way it usually did? My piano teacher asked me what was wrong, and noted that my hands were ice cold. They had also become completely locked and rigid; I don\'t believe my fingers were bent, but my wrists were at a 90angle pointing inward and my fingers were all pointed in as well, toward my body. She helped me up because she thought we could run some warm water over my hands and that maybe they were stiff from the cold. As she walked me to her bathroom, my right foot was just dragging across the floor. At this point my speech was also slurred and I was confused.   \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>I believe I laid down on her couch, and my mother called 911. I don\'t know how long it took for them to get there. I never once lost consciousness. I think at one point I may have closed my eyes--but I didn\'t lose consciousness.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>In the ambulance, I remember they had a lot of trouble either finding a vein or just getting a needle in I don\'t really know. I just remember being stuck like 3-4 times. Normally I would\'ve cared, but I was really dazed--or maybe weirdly calm. I don\'t know. They also wrapped me in a blanket.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>It took a little while to get to the hospital, I don\'t know exactly how long, but I know we lived about 45 minutes away (for normal, non-ambulance driving) from the children\'s hospital they were taking me to.   \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>By the time we got to the hospital I was a little bit more aware of what was going on, I believe my hands had started to unlock, and I was able to walk. I remember getting a CT scan, but that is the only test I remember having, and when reviewing the records my mother has from that time period, it does not appear that they did any other tests.   \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Sometime after the CT, they gave me hand warmers and I was in a wheel chair. My hands were unlocked, my speech wasn\'t slurred anymore, etc. I was discharged referred to a neurologist for further testing.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>I had an EEG and an MRI in January and both showed no abnormalities. I don\'t remember the possible causes that were given to me by the neurologist, I was young and upset and mostly just let my mother handle all of it because it scared me. But that was literally where the investigations ended.   \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>It never happened again exactly the way it did then. I also cannot recall much from my childhood before the incident to be able to say if I had anxious/OCD tendencies beforehand, but I definitely did afterwards and have ever since. I also have motor tics now, but do not recall whether I had any (mild or otherwise) prior to the incident. (I violently roll my eyes, flex/open my jaw, sometimes flex my tongue, and I\'m constantly cracking my knuckles and popping my elbows if they feel stiff--but I\'m not really sure that counts as a tic)  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>About 3 years after the incident I had a panic attack during singing lessons which did cause my hands to lock up the same way they did at the time of this incident. They were also tingly/numb and I cannot recall if they were tingly/numb the very first time. After 10-15 minutes this subsided. My speech didn\'t slur, so my assumption is it was just a panic attack at least that time.\n\nNow, when my hands get cold and stiff in the winter, I always flash back to this incident. It doesn\'t cause me a great deal of distress, but it\'s frustrating when I am reminded that I have no answers as to what the heck happened that day.\n\nStory time is over, so here\'s all the relevant info I can think of from present day:\n\n**Current info about me:**\n\n* 24 y/o\n* Female\n* 5\'7"" about 205 lbs\n* White\n* USA\n\n**Diagnoses:**\n\n* ADHD (only one diagnosed at time of incident)\n* GAD\n* Depression\n* OCD\n* Unspecified autoimmune disorder?\n\n**Daily medications:**\n\n* Adderall - 30mg (only medication that I was also taking at time of incident)\n* Sertraline - 100mg\n* Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) - 200mg, 2x/day (for the unspecificied autoimmune disorder lol)\n* Vitamin D3 1000IU/25mcg \n\nIn February 2022 my bloodwork showed a positive ANA.

The celiac panel showed that I do not have Celiac\'s, and my Anti-Thyroid Peroxidase IgG antibody is still positive for whatever that matters.\n\nAny time I\'ve had my blood checked this year my thyroid levels have been perfectly fine.  \nI have been referred to a cardiologist due to a very high resting heart rate (never below 100, and it has been as high as 130 as of last month). My EKG with my PCP was normal.\n\nI do currently vape nicotine and have for about 2-3 years or so. I am aware that this coupled with two of my daily medications can affect my heart rate. \n\nI think that\'s it?\n\nThanks for reading if you, for some ungodly reason, actually made it this far.

NSAID,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/c0l4gq/microdiscectomy_3_day_postop_check_in/,b'Microdiscectomy 3 day post-op check in',,"b""Hey everyone! I hope you are all having a relatively pain free day. I had a laminectomy and microdiscectomy 3 days ago on my L5-S1 herniated disc. I had my sciatic pain for 4 months prior and nothing seemed to make it better so I decided surgery was the only option I had left. Here's my story.\n\nThe week leading up to the surgery they said no NSAIDS, and I found that some mix between narcos and gabapentin seemed to help but only for a couple hours, and I limited myself to 3 a day, so the rest of the day was pretty painful. And without any anti-inflammatory aids it was a pretty rough week. Other pre-op things I had to do were get some labs, take some antibiotics, and shower with hibiclens a few times.\n\nThe morning of the surgery I was excited and terrified at the same time. But even just laying on the hospital bed waiting to get taken in, my sciatica was still bugging me so I wasn't having second thoughts at all. They put in an IV and started wheeling me to the OR and that's all I remember.\n\nI awoke with a bit of nausea and for some reason I could not stop shaking. It freaked me out a little bit but went away after a few minutes. The next thing I noticed was my sciatica was completely gone. My surgeon said my herniation was even worse than it was on my MRI and it was a good thing I got the surgery as he didn't think it would have healed by itself.\n\nI ended up staying one night in the hospital, they said some people go home almost right away, but I was comfortable there and didn't see the need to rush out. They basically just kept an eye on my vitals and gave me meds. They told me I could get up and use the bathroom or they would give me a catheter, that got me up quickly.  I had a couple visits from a PT and OT and they basically taught me how to roll out of bed, dress myself, shower, etc. They went over the rules, mainly no bending, lifting, or twisting for weeks. I bought some tools from the hospital like a grabber and sock aid and then went home. \n\nIt is now day 3 post-op and recovery is pretty slow. One big question and fear I had before surgery was what the pain was like. Basically the pain is less than my bad sciatica flare UPS and it only hurts when I move. Still no sciatic pain except for an occasional dull pain in my hip which I'm not that worried about. I can usually lay in bed in comfort as opposed to it hurting pretty much non stop before. \n\nThe hardest part is doing simple tasks without bending or twisting. I can do most things on my own, like I don't need help going to the bathroom or anything like that. Mainly just with reaching for things or lifting things. I can do stairs a couple times a day, and I can sit at the dinner table to eat, although not for very long.\n\n Pain wise, today doesn't feel much better than a couple days ago, and I was hoping for a little progress by now, so it's definitely going to be a slow recovery. They gave me pain pills for 7 days so hopefully it will be mostly gone by then.\n\nI'm very glad I did it, I can at least now see the light at the end of the tunnel. I just hope for a slight improvement in pain each day and increase my activity level a little each day. I hope to be back to living a somewhat normal life some time in the near future. I at least have hope again.\n\nIf you have any questions about the surgery please don't hesitate to ask.\n\nEdit: 5 days after surgery now. Sciatica still gone and the incision site is getting better. Starting to ween myself off my meds and try to get back to feeling somewhat normal again. I can go for short walks but still can't sit for very long. I've had a little nausea but mostly I'm just so tired. And I want to try to be more active but I'm not sure what to do with myself.\n\nEdit 2: 1 week since surgery and just realized how bad the constipation had gotten. Guess I wasn't taking my colace enough or eating enough fiber. I spent most of the day yesterday sitting on the toilet and feeling like hell, today I feel a little bit better. Stopped taking pain pills and for the next couple days will focus on digestion. Now I just have to figure out what is causing my insomnia, only sleeping a couple hours at a time is getting old. For the most part my incision feels good and try to walk a little more each day.\n\nEdit 3: 10 days since surgery and still have lingering hip pain when standing or walking. Doctor said it was normal for the nerve to wake up and could take some time to heal. Back pain from surgery is almost completely gone with some occasional pain when I sit for too long or move the wrong way.  Stopped taking all of my meds and hip pain is manageable without it.  My energy level and appetite is mostly back to normal. I can walk a mile+ without any issues other than the hip discomfort.  Yesterday my wife took me to run some errands and it felt good to leave the house, I was able to sit in a car with minimal discomfort.  I will still take things slowly and cautiously and continue no BLT. I will try to go back to work Monday since I am out of leave time but I am nervous about driving and sitting/standing all day.\n\nEdit 4: 2 weeks after surgery now and I'm back at work.  Driving isn't too bad if I can find a good position, but twisting still hurts a little and seems to aggravate my nerve so I still try to limit driving as much as I can.  At my desk I try to switch between sitting and standing every half hour or so but I still get a little tired.  I may work partial days this week and build up to working full days next week.\n\nEdit 5: 3 week update!  Still have a bit of a nagging pain in my hip, but it comes and goes and is pretty mild.  I can live with it for a while, and it's a good reminder not to bend over or twist.  My incision is mostly healed now, almost all of the scab came off yesterday.  I can now sit for an hour+ although I try not to.  But if feels good to be able to do little things like go out to eat."""

My eczema/atopic dermatitis/allergy journey has been a long and painful one, so apologies for the long post. \n\nI was first diagnosed with eczema at around 5(?) or so, pretty much right after recovering from pneumonia on antibiotics (which I think ruined my immune system and causes my issues). Pretty much ever since then, the treatment eczema has dominated my life. Its been constant use of corticosteroid creams (taromometasine, protopic, elidel etc etc). Every few months Id have a good period where I didnt really flare too badly and it seemed under control, but beginning in about 10th grade my eczema started to get so much worse. \n\nFirst it happened on my scalp, where Id get these huge lesions and scabs that I would scratch and that would weep (my mom used to comb them out and apply my ointments, bless her soul). But that eventually went away. Then it got really bad along my arm and hands to the point where it would stick to my clothes and would need to be dressed like wounds. Eventually, that cleared up. \n\nFast forward to my first year in Uni, the real start of the decline. Quickly my skin started to be at an all time low. It was flaky, dry, itchy and would clump in these huge scaled patches, and would crack, weep and bleed despite any treatment. Suddenly Covid hit toward the end of my first year and I pushed through. At the start of second year it wasnt that bad, manageable but still painful. \n\nEventually during second year it got to a point where I couldnt move, like I was physically unable to move because of how much pain I was in (not the worst sentencing during quarantine but still a defeating fate). That summer I had to drop courses that were running on campus because of my skin and the pain levels (first time Ive ever let my eczema dictate or come in the way of my academic progression). \n\nThat summer I ended up in hospital because I had no other alternative due to closures and restrictions here in Canada. The doctor prescribed my oral steroids so I would qualify for light therapy. After taking the steroids for ONE day, my pain was immediately reduced but the condition of my skin remained the same. I was then (somewhat) forced into starting UV light therapy as the doctor I saw said that I needed to do so to qualify for stronger treatment options (no hate at all). After enduring the most painful and excruciating months, light therapy was over and my skin had only gotten worse.\n\nAfter all of this my skin was still not any better, and I was started on Dupixent (dupilimab) with bi-weekly injections. At first it was amazing, my skin cleared up, I has no pain and was the happiest I had been in so longbut that didnt last for long. About four/five months on Dupixent I started to develop weird hives (grouped) and subsequently aquagenic urticaria that would show up about 5 minutes after injecting Dupixent, and would disappear an hour later. Sadly the water sensitivities and hives persisted and the Dupixent stopped working. \n\nI told my doctors and they all suggested I stop dupixent as it seemed that I was having an allergic reaction to the drug. Following this development I was started on Rinvoq (the immunosuppressant) which, again, worked wonders at first. Now, Im still on Rinvoq (about 6 months in and in my fourth year) and although my eczema is much better than it was, I still get constant flareups (WEEKLY) that are more similar to allergic reactions (swollen, hot, hive, bumpy, painful, itchy large patches on my face, neck, back, arms and shoulders). The Rinvoq helps overall but these flareups are fucking unbearable, and it doesnt even seem like eczema anymore. I still use protopic to manage these flares as well as ice packs, ice masks, cold rollers and fans to bring down the swelling. The only moisturizer that works for me is vaseline which I use everyday, 3 times a day. \n\n[EXTRA] - Ive gone through allergy testing (nothing out of the ordinary and have removed anything associated), have dieted and cut out potential dietary triggers (i.e., dairy, hazelnut, red meat, etc), I only use NATURAL (no sulphates, alcohol, etc) soaps and detergents, and I take lukewarm (not cold or hot) showers. I dont smoke weed or drink at all, only take my Vyvanse (40mg daily) and vape. \n\nMy doctors are lovely and have been such a big help, as have my family, girlfriend and friends, but I cant keep living like this and just dreading doing anything that might effect and make my skin any more worse than it constantly is. I just feel like such a burden to those most involved in my life and my journey, and just want for this to end so that I can get back to being helpful, doing the things that I love and finding some peace. \n\nAnyways, thanks for listeningIm not expecting a cure-all treatment or method, even pity or shame. All I wanna know is if there is anyone else who has/had similar symptoms, what they are doing/did and if theres anything else I can try. Thanks. \n\n[pics available if yall want] \n\n- Oct :)'"

So far, I've had a history of CRSwNP that resulted in a surgery (alongside a septoplasty which fixed it but not fully as well as an adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, and I believe turbinate reduction) and I am basically allergic to everything. My doctors couldn't believe how my total IgE was over the 700s with somehow getting a positive reaction to every blood test they did, almost everything on the skin pricks, and especially to most foods (which make it almost impossible to even do an elimination diet). Currently I'm on a daily regimen of Nasonex, Claritin, Advair, and Singulair, although I switch up the Claritin often. I had Flonase but my doctor switched me to mometasone given insurance wants to see failures before moving me into XHance or Dupixent. Even so, on a regular basis, I don't often notice it, until I get this sharp pain in my inner ear where it swells up and I lose my hearing.\n\nMy pulmonologist is currently looking into whether or not I have AERD. He feels given the IgE, I could have eosinophilic, allergic, and exercise induced asthma.  Originally I didn't think I was allergic to Aspirin, but after realizing I did have an adverse reaction to Moltrin when I was young that no longer happens with NSAIDs, it may be a possibility. My PFTs are often normal, but my Methacholine Challenge came back positive (I believe they tested me at 1mL on the first run). My ENT has put me on allergy shots but was hoping that my Skyrizi usage for my psoriasis would help me out as well, but there has been discussion about starting Dupixent as well for my current situation. My pulmonologist doesn't like the idea as much, but overall as long as I don't trigger my asthma, I'm basically breathing fine and I'm healthy there \n\nWith the most recent CT, we see the polyps again in the same area, we still see the build up, but it brought up mastoids again (1st time in 2019 when I lived around NYC) with potential damage from it. At this point, I'm trying to figure out what is going on. My CBC and CMP have come up normal multiple times. We really don't know what's going on other than my body overreacting to basically everything.\n\nI just figured I'd post this to see if anyone has been in my position. This is just a combination of really strange things that I can't seem to figure out."""

How concerning is this?**\n\nI am a transporter in a hospital. I did not catch covid until Omicron, just before Christmas 2021. In fact, I wasnt sick for over 2 years, until then. I do work with every kind of sick patient, including covid and active TB.\n\nI am fully vaccinated for literally everything, including 2 initial Pfizer shots, 1 Pfizer booster, and 1 Pfizer bivalent, plus quad flu, Hep B, and PCV.\n\nNov 2022: my spouse and I both caught something awful that wasnt covid, influenza A or B, or strep. It kicked our asses, we both needed oral steroids and albuterol. I have viral and allergic asthma, my husband is completely healthy (the jerk).  I suspect we had RSV. We were seen by our PCP.\n\nJan 2023: I got another cold; my husband did not. It was just a cold, so I just treated it with OTC products, rest, and fluids. Asthma not affected. \n\nApr 22, 2023: I started developing a quite bad case of esophageal, oropharyngeal, and nasopharyngeal candidiasis. It was bad enough that it made it nearly impossible to swallow and I seriously considered going to the ER. My PCP saw me that Tue, and I am doing much better, and I have a few days left of the oral ketoconazole and the clotrimazole troches.\n\nApr 30, 2023: On this past Sunday, while I was still dealing with the pain and inflammation from the candidiasis, my symptoms changed slightly. It turns out I now have covid, as do the two people I was in extended close contact with on Fri (get your minds out of the gutter!). I was symptomatic first, on Sun; the other two were fine until Tue. This time around the Sx are somewhat worse, and are affecting my asthma. The last time, it did not.\n\nMy PCP thinks I developed thrush from my steroid inhaler and nose spray. However, I will admit that I have been lax in using the inhaler lately because my asthma was doing great despite the spring. It doesnt usually kick in until Aug, when the grasses and weeds pollen are highest. I am also paranoid about thrush, and I rinse twice and then brush my teeth. Ive never had thrush before, and Ive been on a steroid inhaler and nose spray for well over a decade. \n\nMy PCP also thinks I contracted covid because of the candidiasis.   \n\n\nI would handwave away the colds due to masking for nearly 3 years. But Im not pregnant, immunocompromised (aside from ICS), or have AIDS, which means its weird AF for me to develop thrush, especially really bad thrush like I have, in just 2 days. **Is it concerning that Ive been so sick so often in the past 5 months?**\n\nHeres all the shit wrong with me, and my meds: \n\n* viral and allergic asthma; 10mg montelukast, Flovent 220, albuterol PRN (rarely) Flonase, 1 tab fexofenadine, 1 tab cetirizine. \n* Environmental allergies; see above, plus bepostatine eye drops.\n* Celiac Disease; GF diet except on Xmas and bday as I am asymptomatic and my PCP gave me the thumbs up. I also just had a FU EGD in Mar and my duodenum had no signs of CD just 2.5 months after I gluten-binged over the holidays for 3 weeks. My gastroenterologist also diagnosed me with mild gastritis, which he attributed to meloxicam Id briefly taken in the fall for lateral epicondylitis. Saw gastroenterologis, who discovered my asx CD during an EGD for refractory GERD.\n* GERD; 30mg dexlansoprazole BID; no coffee. Saw gastro.\n* New Daily Persistent Headache; 600, 600, 900 mg gabapentin. 75mg venlafaxine. Rizatriptan for the very rare breakthrough headache. Saw neuro.\n* Last year I was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia, and after I got my iron back up, Ive been taking an iron supplement 3x/wk for maintenance. Attributed to CD. Saw both PCP and heme/onc.\n* I also use bepostatine eye drops for allergies and meibomian gland disorder, along with OTC oil-based eye drops to maintain moisture on my eyes. Saw ophtho.\n* Candidiasis; 100mg fluconasole daily, clotrimazole troches 10mg 5x/day\n* I also take Vit D because I live in the PNW.\n* Covid; Symbicort rather than Flovent, DayQuil NyQuil, Halls cough drops for sore throat, nose, and chest. My peak flow is down about 20% and Symbicort and albuterol dont help. However, my O2 sat is 97+% and I dont feel any SOB.\n\n**TLNDR: I have been sick a lot recently, including very bad candidiasis and my 2nd bout of covid. How concerning is this?**'"

I (24F) have been dealing with a pretty rough deal of super oily skin and hormonal and cystic acne for the past year-ish. I had my first appointment with the dermatologist for it in December, when I was put on WinLevi and Tretinoin. Been using that daily ever since, and Id say my acne has improved but just wont let up completely.\n\nYesterday, I had my follow up with the dermatologist. Also said that my oiliness and breakouts are starting to get bad again since the warmer weather has kicked in. So, I was told I can stop using WL, but continue with tret. And with that, theyve put me on Spiro. I was advised to take 25mg daily for the first 2-3 weeks, then can take 50mg daily from there on out. \n\nI was told the side effects would likely be very minimal, the derm said it will be important to stay hydrated since it can dry out my lips/mouth/face since its ultimately meant to combat the oiliness. But Ive heard it can cause dizziness since it also acts as a high blood pressure medication (though my BP is usually elevated bc I have an anxiety disorder, so maybe this will work in my favor lol). Then, I saw how it can affect periods, cause vein damage, heart problems, can mess with your bodys vitamins and in rare cases, lead to GI bleeding and depression. This is the first oral prescription medication Ive ever been prescribed aside from birth control and I just want to ensure the side effects wont be a problem (anxiety disorder showing? Haha). I have a few friends who have even taken it and they said they had very minimal to no side effects from it. But Ive gone down a few rabbit holes on the Internet and have seen otherwise.

influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n4ct3e/terrified_of_my_second_vaccine_dose_tomorrow_tw/,b'Terrified of My Second Vaccine Dose Tomorrow [TW: Nausea]',,"b'Sooo, a *huge* part of my anxiety is rooted in the feelings surrounding being nauseas and/or throwing up. Truthfully, I dont mind throwing up at all. I actually get an endorphin rush (like a runners high) from it- what I cant stand at all is the nausea leading up to it. \n\nWhats even worse though is that one of the major symptoms of my anxiety is, you guessed it- nausea. When I had my first anxiety attack last year, it lasted almost three days off-and-on. I would get anxious, feel nauseas, lose my appetite, and when I finally calmed down my stomach would hurt so bad from hunger that its freak me out back into anxiety. \n\nPrior to my anxiety Id basically just have full-on meltdowns when I was sick with a stomach bug. Panicked walking and talking, crying, almost like a stress-induced temper tantrum but all the anger was just utter despair. I havent been sick since my anxiety, but just last week I was constipated and it *almost* sent me spiraling like my first anxiety attack.\n\nNow, Im getting my second dose of the vaccine tomorrow (Moderna). Im a 20 year-old male, and before this pandemic I wouldve said I had a fairly good immune system (I havent been sick beyond a cold for a few years, knocking on wood). My first shot had basically zero side affects other than fatigue, and as far as I know Ive never caught COVID prior. \n\nToday my friend said her friend got the first dose and was fine- when she got the second of the Moderna though she ended up puking her guts out for a whole day and that thought alone has made me so anxious its getting hard to even talk about it without my tummy getting mad at me. \n\nIm *TERRIFIED* this second dose will make me ill, and all the doctors are saying Stronger immune systems=stronger reactions, and if you had weak side effects the first time then expect stronger ones the second time, etc. \n\nSo now I have a dilemma; What if I get the shot and throw up? Will my anxiety attack stop this time, or will I be caught in that loop again? Last time I FORCED myself to eat 5 crackers and almost threw them up every bite... it took two hours to eat them. Then I had to force down an actual meal. I cant do that again, that one incident left me with after shocks of anxiety attacks for a whole month. \n\nThen theres the alternative- I get no symptoms... but what if I worry SO MUCH about them that I give myself those symptoms? With my first dose I hadnt even known there were side effects until immediately before getting them, and all I thought was that they were a fever and chills and there was a tiny chance Id be allergic... just that limited information made my heart rate elevate the rest of the day. \n\nIm really wigging out about it now, and Im starting to flat out consider not even getting the second dose which is completely irrational and stupid but, then again- if I had to choose between staying isolated for another year versus having even 3 days of that anxiety again, Id choose the isolation in a heart beat. Id rather get Rapunzled the rest of my life than go through those three stupid days again.'"

Its a long read but I hope it helps someone out there get tested if they are on the fence about whether or not they have ADHD!\n\nLet me start by saying that I was diagnosed with ADHD At 10 years old but decided to gaslight myself into believing that I was misdiagnosed because I was a good student (I just couldnt sit still in elementary school). My parents put me on Concerta for a week and it made me so aggressive that I actually pushed my best friend (I would never ever hurt anyone). As a result, I avoided meds for the next 21 years of my life because of an irrational fear of being dependent on medicine that could turn me into a different person. I was so weird about meds that I even avoided pain meds like Advil and Tylenol.\n\nWhen it came to school, I always worked myself to the point of sickness and exhaustion just to get a B or A in my classes. I always thought I just needed to work harder than everyone, to the point where I was sick with a stress induced cold/flu every month! I was skipping class week after week because I barely even had time to sleep with how much I had to study to keep up. But I kept my grades high regardless. I thought maybe I had an autoimmune disorder, and that I would just have to live with sickness for my whole life. \n\nSocially, I always felt just slightly different from my peers. I like to think that I am incredibly personable and a great listener, but I always felt like I was stuck right between introverted and extroverted. I go through week long periods of recovery where I MUST be alone after a few days of intense social interaction. And sometimes I feel socially awkward out of nowhere and have a hard time speaking my thoughts coherently. My friends used to get upset that I would never reach out to them and always waited for them to make plans with me. When confronting them about how I feel and my insecurities, they always told me that it was just in my head because they love hanging out with me and chatting. As a result, I chocked my mood swings and recovery periods to manic depression and assumed I would just have to live with it forever. I told myself that I was just an introverted extrovert.\n\nThings continued like this for a while until this fall semester, the start of my senior year studying computer science at university. Something was not right. I was skipping half my classes and just couldnt get myself interested in the material. I was smoking daily to cope with a deep depression and stopped reaching out to people. I was just sick, lonely, and felt like a failure. I couldnt even get myself to go to the grocery store to buy food for myself. I hit rock bottom when I failed two midterms and realized that my dream of cum laude had vanished before my eyes.\n\nI decided to get retested by a psychologist and was once again was diagnosed with ADHD-C. I was scared and sad that something was wrong with my brain and didnt want to believe it. My doctor prescribed 10mg or adderall 1-2x/day for my school days and I was apprehensive given my past. I finally decided to just try it on one of my 8 hour school days and figured that if it made me feel weird I could just stop immediately.\n\nThat day literally changed my life forever. For the first time in my life, I could actually understand each word coming out of my professors mouth. It was crystal clear! I also felt this new, deep love for learning. I was fascinated by my classes and couldnt wait to watch YouTube videos on the content we were learning (yes, the very same classes just a week ago I was skipping). My restless legs stilled and I had no desire to fidget. No boredom, no sadness, no depression. Just a love for learning. It was the first time ever that I did not have to teach myself the content out of the textbook because I actually UNDERSTOOD the whole lecture!!\n\nAfter that first class, I had this uncontrollable urge to just speak to everyone and make so many new friends. I sent texts to old friends asking to hang out, filled up my weekend with plans, and started random conversations with people in my classes who I would NEVER talk to. I went from never reaching out to accidentally double or triple booking my nights with plans. I also got this weird feeling where I just want to tell everyone how amazing and beautiful they are are and call my family members to tell them I love them. So thats what I did, I called my mom and told her how lucky I am to have her in my life and texted my best friends letting them know I love them. This is SO unlike me, I NEVER reach out, I hate phone calls, and I have way too much anxiety to talk to strangers.\n\nThat full 8 hour day felt like a breeze. Normally, I would have come home and taken a nap, but instead I CHOSE to go to the grocery store after school! I cleaned my apartment and still had the energy to start my homework. \n\nIts been 2 weeks since that day and I have not missed a single class. Infact, for the first time in my life, I actually look forward to my longer school days. I start my homework on time, I reach out to friends, and my desire to smoke has disappeared. Ive even been going on dates again and have really been impressing boys with my new conversation skills. I am finally the person that I have always wanted to be. My fraternity friends say that I am a different person and that it is clear as day to them how much happier I am.  \n\nIf you are like me and felt socially awkward, or are working yourself to death, or are not taking care of your own health, PLEASE GO GET TESTED FOR ADHD. You do not need to live like this for the rest of your life. Thank you for hearing my story. If anyone else has had a similar experience (especially with social anxiety) I would love to hear and chat with you about it!'"

This did not appear to be due to the bite. Also, my masseter was injured during this appointment.\n\nAppointment 2, November 6th: When I went in a month later, the dentist looked at the xrays and offered to fix it on the spot with SDF. He did not make it clear to me that a temporary filling would be used afterwards, requiring another visit. In addition, not only did he drill out the offending tooth, but the one behind it as well. I was horrified.\n\nAll of this happened AFTER I asked him to be explicit about what he was doing (he initially didn\'t even tell me he was going to use SDF, just ""I\'ll put some medicine on it that will decrease sensitivity."")\n\nAs it was a month since the last appt, I was able to get numb with the second type of anaesthetic for this.\n\nThe temporary filling was too soft as it had not been allowed to adequately set (I produce a lot of saliva, and my jaw was not opening well due to the strain from the first appointment.)\n\nAppointment 3, November 8th: I came in to hopefully just finish up the work since the filling wasn\'t staying. I couldn\'t get numb. After about 8 injections of 3 different anaesthetics, I still couldn\'t get numb. More temporary filling was placed, and it set well this time.\n\nI was in so much pain for days following. Headaches and diarrhea (side effects of the anaesthetic?) and my poor poor jaw and gums.\n\nAppointment 4, November 20th: I was hoping enough time had passed that the anaesthetic would work for me. I avoided caffeine and activity the day of and I took about a dozen Tums prior to the appointment (I read that increasing ones pH this way can improve the efficacy of the anaesthetic). I also asked for an anti-anxiety med as I read that can increase the efficacy of anaesthetic, but I would have needed that prescribed at an earlier appointment.\n\nThe anaesthetic didn\'t work. Then the dentist left the room and came back in with another needle, mumbled about ""trying this"" then he injected something deep into my face and I felt a hot ""wash"" sensation over the side of my brain. Immediately, my eye stopped tracking with my other one and I couldn\'t blink. Also, my jaw locked and we couldn\'t even open it enough to place a bite block.\n\nI begged him to just do the work anyways, but he refused. He said he wanted to refer me to another dentist that uses gas.\n\nTemporary fillings placed again, 2 days before thanksgiving.\n\nI\'m so lost on what to do. I just want to get this over with. The other dentist he referred me to is another low cost clinic that accepts my insurance. It would probably take another 2 appt at least to finish this up, and I live an hour away, this is getting very difficult and expensive. I feel like I may need to go to Mexico so I can afford to pay to get put under (I need a root canal anyways, would love to get it done all at once)\n\nPlease, what would you do in this circumstance?\n\n[This was repacked with temp filling 6 days ago.](https://preview.redd.it/cktlhuwxmr021.jpg?width=883&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d592d8906af0b849d5341d23f1b0ae645db0a026)'"

The week prior I had swollen glands and a fever but thought I had got over it until that Sunday. \n\nOn Monday morning I checked my tonsils and noticed how swollen they were and that there was white pus. I phoned up the doctors yesterday and the nurse diagnosed me over the phone with tonsillitis and prescribed me 10 days worth of penicillin. I know it takes a little while to work but I feel like my tonsils are so swollen, and seem to swell by the day. I can still swallow, even thought its extremely painful, and I can breath when I sit up, but I notice if I lie down on my back or my side my breathing isnt too good. I also cant speak too great. Is this normal of tonsillitis or does it look more serious?\n\nThis is my first time having it so I have no idea how severe it is. Im wondering if I should go to the emergency room or just soldier on with the penicillin?\n\nHeres a picture: [Tonsils](https://imgur.com/a/9ERZEwg)'"

Made good money some times, but had the worst timing ever, have made about 5-6 mistakes that cost me $50-100K each! After losing everything again, had no choice but to move back to Moms 18 months ago\n\nI had tax issues I never dealt with, should have been much sooner but the pandemic, Dads cancer death..so many things. So instead of working, just been hanging around. Still weighed 330 July/21, but with walking I cut down to 305 late 2021 and currently 255. I should be feeling great no? Not really \n\nAround December 1st, I stopped my walks and going outdoors almost cold Turkey. Had recently developed bad heartburn but improved my diet slowly while losing weight. 12/8 I couldnt sleep at 4 am, went downstairs to watch TV and suddenly felt my left pec just get a jolt, same time as my head. Panic, take aspirin phone 911. EMTS took good care, after a 32 hour wait I find out its not my heart- they assured me thats why I waited so long. Also had a treadmill test last Easter which was A-1, come to think of it thats the chest pain started the prior November when I was starting to indoors a lot, again! \n\n12/29 I go to mall for a walk and check my BP, which was improved to about 125/85 prior month. Saw a high # and just panicked before I sat and calmed down. Drove to 2 more stores, still had bad anxiety, bought a Smart TV, then went to pharmacy and ran into a friend I made at the hospital. Calmed me down\n\nSo I made an appointment with Doctor for Friday the 13th, but Wednesday after not having eaten for 24 hours, has a sandwich and Boom same chest jolt . Try to relax @ head upstairs but couldnt make it 1 step- laid down heart racing played soft music and OK after 30 minutes\n\nDoctor 1/13 prescribes Zoloft and Dexilant. Stomach is not so much the issue, just fart/burp a lot & chest gets tight if I dont let it out ASAP. Go to Moms pharmacy, I refuse to drive until Im\nHealthier, snowstorm & her driving stressed me both ways. Stand up at counter & dropped into a squat, couldnt stand. Pharmacist came around & calmed me down & gave me my pills, but it took all my courage to walk the 100 feet to Moms car. Scary\n\nWe live in a 4 level townhouse. All I do since I got the new TV is struggle to go down for 1-2 meals, then back up to my room on bed. Im terrified of exercise or the outdoors. \n\nSo could this  all be a Vitamin D deficiency? I had COVID bad around July 1st, for months had brain fog but thank God thats slowly disappeared. Can 4-5 weeks inside and inactive screw a person up THIS BAD????? I know I have to stay off my phone/TV and spend less time in bed. But I read about the initial side effects of Zoloft & Im delaying starting. Had a 30 of Dexilant & cant say I need that either. Anyway going for blood work as soon as Monday so Ill see if Im deficient \n\nI might have POTS, heart rate seems to speed up just getting out of bed for a pee. But Im careful to sit down right after. NEVER short of breath thank God, that would scare the hell out of me\n\nBut seriously WTF? I eat the wrong thing I could have unreal chest pain followed by anxiety. If I fast TOO long it seems thats just as BAD for my stomach and anxiety. Where is the happy medium people?\n\nPlease leave me comments guys, I Thought my finances and weight were the only issues I had and NOW THIS. Since last Easter I was a new man , no more hopelessness & suicidal thoughts, life felt good! Now every time I feel a new ache I worry..'"

This community has taught me so much. Ive never posted here before, but now Ive finally gotten to a point where I am proud of my skin. I have created this post to show my progress based on my current treatment, and I have provided as much information as possible, maybe too much, including personal skin details, past history, treatments, regiments, and why Ive chose certain products. I still have mild acne, though it has significantly decreased and I hope you enjoy this post!\n  \n**[Heres a Link to the Album to See My Progress Over the Last 5 Months](http://imgur.com/a/uVr4y)**  \n  \n**Information about me**  \n\n* **Sex**: Male  \n* **Age**: 21  \n* **Skin Type**: Combination, can get very oily, Tans Easily  \n* **Acne Locations:** Mostly Face, Some Chin, Mild on Chest and Back\n* **Onset of Symptoms**: Age 15  \n* **Allergies**: No Known Allergies to Medications, Allergic to Dogs\n* **Diet**: Mostly chicken, some beef, not enough vegetables, sugary snacks and drinks  \n* **Excercise**: Walking around NYC, run 5K one day a week\n* **Stress**: Very high  \n* **Regularly Taken Medications**: Vyvanse, Hydroxyzine, Nexium  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**History Before Current Treatment**  \nIve had acne since high school. Freshman year of college I started to try to treat it. I couldnt afford a dermatologist, so I relied on r/skincareaddiction and r/acne. At the time I was using luxury products from Kiehls Apothecary, and I stepped my game up, but my acne only slightly decreased\n  \n**Old Regimen**\n  \nMorning | Night |\n\n---------|----------|\n\nKiehls Ultra Facial Oil-Free Cleanser| Kiehls Ultra Facial Oil-Free Cleanser\nClaror SkinCare Acne Treatment, 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide| Stridex Maximum Strength Pads\nKiehls Facial Oil-Free Lotion|Kiehls Facial Oil-Free Lotion\n  \nA few month ago, I was fed up with my acne and decided I couldnt treat mine with just OTC products. I needed to see a dermatologist but I really could not afford one at the time. I found an app called Spruce that charges $40/visit [$30 for first visit] and gave it a shot. I filled out my patient information, took picture of my face, and sent everything securely over the app. \n  \nIn less than 24 hours, my doctor got back to me with the following message:\n>It appears that you have a mix of comedonal and inflammatory acne. Comedonal acne occurs when your pores become become blocked by a combination of sebum (a component of skin oil) and dead skin cells. The result is referred to as a blackhead (when the clogged pore is open) or a whitehead (when it's closed); in either case comedonal acne can make your skin look and feel bumpy. Inflammatory acne occurs when the area underneath the clogged pore becomes red and/or tender. At this point, we call them papules or pustules, depending on whether pus is present. You might also experience deep, tender bumps called cysts. **I am prescribing you the two topical medications and one oral medication that you experienced improvement with in the past.  These will take several months to have an effect.**\n  \n**Below I have included my new Regimen**  \n\nIts been modified a bit since my first visit, though heres my current routine and products I use. Prescriptions are italicized. All the products I am currently using can be found at your local drug store and are affordable.\n\nMorning | Night |\n:--------:|:--------:|\n*100 mg doxycycline pill* | *100 mg doxycycline pill* |\nNeutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash 2% salicylic acid cleanser | CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser |\nNeutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel | Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel |\n*Clindamycin-Benzoyl Peroxide 1.2%-5% gel Duac* | *Tretinoin topical 0.1% cream* |\nNeutrogena Deep Moisture Day Cream | Neutrogena Deep Moisture Night Cream |\n  \n**Other Products Used**  \n\n* **Clarisonic**: To exfoliate physically and gently remove dead skin twice a week  \n* **OTC Salycylic Acid Spot Treatment**: For small blemishes  \n* **Kiehls Rare Earth Pore Cleansing Mask**  \n* **CeraVe Daytime and Nightime Moisturizing Lotion**\n  \n**Reasons Why I Like the Products Ive Mentioned**  \n\n* **Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash**: Was recommended by my dermatologist and I think it's a great SA cleanser. CeraVes SA wash is great as well  \n* **Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel**: Honestly I love this moisturizer as a base. I put it on right after drying my face when cleansing and it does a great job moisturizing my skin and giving a good base-layer of moisture. Costco has a good package that comes with eye cream.  \n* **Neutrogena Deep Moisture**: I love the Dat and Night Creams by Neutrogena. They are pretty thick, maybe a little thinner than petroleum jelly. But they do a great job of providing a heavy layer of moisture without making my face look too oily.  \n* **CeraVe Facial Moisturizing Lotion**: Great pump bottle of moisturizer to carry around in a bag or bring on vacation  \n\nI really like the products from Neutrogena and CeraVe. Also be sure to check out Trader Joes. Yep, Thats Right! Trader Joes has a pretty good skincare line which I use from time to time.\n\n**Things I Have Learned**\nOkay, so everyones skin is different. We all have different hormones and body chemistry and live in different environments. Ive shared my routine because it worked for me. That does not necessarily mean it will work for you. But if you take away anything from this post, here are some of the things I have learned and the mistakes I have made:  \n* **DRINK MORE WATER**: Seriously, spend money on a nice water bottle to have with you all day long, and you'll actually use it and drink it  \n* **ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION**: I was a heavy drinker when I started treatment. I very rarely drink now. I saw a correlation between decreased alcohol consumption and my breakouts. Correlation does not mean causation, though I believe decreasing my alcohol consumption did have a significant effect on my progress  \n* **SLEEP**: I also saw a correlation between healthier sleep habits and decreased acne  \n* **Dairy**: I used to be a dairyholic. Now I live my life consuming dairy in moderation, as I believe consumption of large amounts of dairy in my past has correlated with cystic acne breakouts.  \n* **Doxycycline**: If you start taking an oral antibiotic, I highly recommend taking it with a meal or you could possibly have an upset stomach. If I take it on an empty stomach, Im usually fine. But if Ive had something acidic like orange juice and no food, Im guaranteed to barf  \n* **Tracking Progress**: The Spruce app does it for you, but taking pictures of my skin with flash close up every few weeks helps me see what kind of acne I still have or is going away and is pretty motivating to continue treatment  \n* **Sun Exposure**: I tan easily. I dont burn. But lemme tell you, I seriously burned my hands over spring break. When using your hands to apply tretinoin or benzoyl peroxide to your face, WASH THEM AFTER! My hands are still peeling a week later and I had to get a steroid cream from my primary care physician yesterday. Im pretty sure someone posted about burnt hands yesterday  \n* **Bleaching**: Prescription topical gels can bleach towels and your hair. I actually like the look of the front of my hair a little lighter, so I actually wipe my hands of with the front of my hair. IDK, Im weird and it does a great job gradually lightening hair. And an even better job ruining your grey pillowcases and roommates pink towels\n  \n**Telehealth**  \nI have received all my prescriptions though a telehealth application on my phone. I really do recommend you check out the Spruce app. I am not affiliated with them. I was afraid to even endorse a company because of post guidelines. But I really like the company. There are others out there, and I bet they are great as well. Ive only tried Spruce and so far I havent had a single complaint.\n  \n**Final Notes**\nI hope the information Ive provided here today is helpful to someone. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. If you have any suggestions or want to point out something I may be doing wrong, please do. For example: Is it okay to be putting a light moisturizer on before treatment, then a heavy one after? I DONT KNOW! but I think its good. Feel free to suggest any edits to my routine.\n  \nLook everyone, treating acne isnt easy. If youve read this far, you know that. And chemical exfoliants can leave you looking like a monster. I too have days where I dont want to leave the house because my face looks like a disaster. And yeah, Im a guy and I admit that on some really bad days, I heavily physically exfoliate my face and throw on tinted moisturizer. Most of you guys on here wont do that. Im not telling you to wear makeup, but it can improve your confidence while youre still treating your acne. """

I can even feel a migraine start and if I can get my jaw to crack within 2 to 5 minutes the pain is gone.\n\n\nThe preventer I used to be on also works for TMJ and helped as well.

He keeps falling asleep at 7am and waking up at 11am and doesn't seem to be able to sleep before or after those times, so he's exhausted all the time.\n\nHe's 50 y/o and haven't had this issue most of his life, it only developed in the past few months/year.  Not sure what triggered it, perhaps when lockdown started he became quite stressed about the pandemic... also when he had his last Covid vaccine he had intense fatigue for a few weeks, so it might have contributed... He's retired so doesn't go to work or anywhere regularly and is generally healthy. Tends to worry too much and overthink but he's always been like that. He's always tired and has no energy but can't fall asleep until 7 am, no matter how exhausted he is.\n\nI wish I could help him but not sure how. I don't think he would want to try any drugs (and we live in the UK, they are quite stingy with prescribing sleeping pills here), over the counter stuff he tried and they didn't work, and i don't think he'll want to do any kind of therapy cause he's stubborn like that (also we can't afford it even if I could persuade him).\n\nAnyone had a similar kind of insomnia and found something else that helps?\n\nAny tips are appreciated."""
influenza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ygs10d/about_bats_and_rabies/,"b""about bat's and rabies""",,"b'Hello, so, about bat\'s if I remember correctly my family have never ever seen a bat in the house before, yet I\'m hearing squeaking noises (I can\'t be sure if it\'s in my vents or if it\'s a bat at all) it\'s pretty quite but I can hear it, and my dad goes out 4-5 times a day (mostly at night, where apparantly bats are common) yet I don\'t even think he\'s ever saw a bit in our street or at all in years or ever, yet every now and then i get the thought, what if I had been bitten by a bat in my sleep, out with friends or whatever without knowing, and then start crying and just feeling shitty, but I want to ask questions, yesterday night I played bat noises to confirm or not if I\'ve actually been hearing bats land or be on my roof and instantly got paranoid incase I lured bats(my beds below am air vent) and there\'s I think 2 air vents in the hall next to my room, including a square box vent thing in the bathroom, I kept on getting paranoid checking all my surroundings with torches or whatever every time I went to the bathroom, I kept on washing my hands too, wouldn\'t itch my eye, was scared to leave my bed, something touched my foot beside my bed I think, so I got my brother to check the bed incase a bat was under it, he said there was nothing there apart from rubbish and dust, but today I\'ve been feeling pretty sick with headaches every now and then, do rabies symptoms (first stage) come and go? And will it take a day or whatever to come I haven\'t left my house in I think 2 weeks I do not know, and haven\'t seen my dogs lately since I\'m always up my room isolating, the other days I was thinking I was going blind(still worried about my eyes) but before the rabies fear, I was shitting bricks at anueryms and calmed down about that, then the thought in my head went, my sister let our dog lick her mouth today, and then what if the dogs have rabies or whatever and I\'m going to die but she\'ll get the vaccine or some stupid shit I don\'t know, I don\'t know I just don\'t know, every time I forget about a fear a new one starts, I just want to kill myself sometimes, I hate myself, I hate everything I do, I\'m not normal, I\'m scared to take medicine, scared of nesrly everything that can kill me, I never leave my house even when most the time my parents ask me to, it took alot of courage to leave my house last month I was happy only had a fear of sleeping (which I still have sometimes) developed a fear of rabies around then i think as I was scared to go near my cousins dog, but could someone answer my questions, if last night a bat did come through the vents after me playing the bat squeaking and flapping sounds, would I of definitely saw and heard them. This has been bothering me since last night, and last night I kept on washing my eyes every time i accidently touched them to the point I made my right eye bleed.. So could someone please answer, do the first stage symptoms like ""the headache"" and would I notice a bat and hear one around me especially when it was really quite, as it was 2 am?. Please I just want fast answers, Ive been really scared of rabies again since last night, I just want to stop worrying about these things, especially in the UK, especially when it\'s apparently rare in bays, especially when my dad goes out in dusk time-around 10 pm is when he stops going out, especially when my parents have apparently never seen a bat in our street or maybe even the city, especially when everyone else would notice (I live with alot of people in my house) Heck today I was scared to out my headset on to talk with my friends as I was scared of a bat being in them, I checked all around the headset and didn\'t see a bat nor do I think I even needed to as it would of fit in the cup I think, I just want help, I can\'t go to my family about these things as they usually call me stupid for thinking of such stuff, can\'t talk to my friends as I only have 2 and one doesn\'t really care about these kind of talks, and one has issues and is usually busy himself, there\'s no one to turn to, I\'m scared of seeing help even though I always say I\'ll get help. Every now and then I\'ll want to kill myself, even though I\'m so scared of death and stuff I never leave my room, I can\'t take this shit, I just want to be normal, I just want to get a Rabies pep or whatever but its 300 pound and I\'ve never even seen a bat until a few weeks ago I think where I saw pics, nor do I even think they can fit through my vents as they look very very small, so as I said could someone please answer the questions about rabies and also, would you notice, hear and definitely feel a bat biting you...'"

I can't be sure the vaccine is causing mine to go up but I'm curious.

Three days later on 2/11/21 my ALT/AST levels were actually within normal limits (low 20s with units of U/L). However, about 1 month later on 3/12/21 my ALT (194 U/L) and AST (90 U/L) became quite elevated! \n\nI was dumb and had a single beer (6% alcohol) on 3/11/21, the night before my blood work. My provider doesn't think the beer caused my levels to go up so much, though.\n\nAfter seeing those results my provider asked me to stop the isotretinoin for 2 weeks. I did that successfully and got blood work 2 days ago on 3/29/21, after 1 day of taking the 80mg again. My ALT was high at 167 U/L and so was my AST at 71 U/L. \n\nSince 3/11/21 I haven't touched alcohol and I also stopped taking my allergy pill (Zyrtec) and I even stopped taking a daily vitamin D/calcium supplement, both of which I took throughout my course of isotretinoin. Otherwise, I had 1 episode of drinking (4 glasses of wine) around New Year's Eve but that didn't seem to give me problems. \n\nI would love to hear if anyone had a similar experience! Again, I don't think my story should dissuade you from getting the vaccine."""

amoxicillin,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/12dhapx,b'Skin Condition - doctors tbink folliculitis',"Image801.jpg, Image802.jpg, Image803.jpg","b'I have been experiencing strange condition since January. It started when I woke up with a cluster of 3 small red bumps on my hand that my immediate assumption were bug bites. After they disnt resolve for a few weeks, i realized they were not bumps. The condition usually first appears in the morning on my hands, fingers or arms. I will wake up with a flat red area. By day 2, the redness and surface area will fade and ill be left with a tiny raised red bump. Doeant really itch, maybe from tkme to time. The bumps take about 3 to 4 weeks to totally flatten, but always seem to leave some type of mark/scar. About a month ago a doctor described it as an inflammation under my skin, and folliculitis.  He gave me an anti bacterial soap (triclosan 1%) and cream (prednisolone/gentamicin sulphate). This appeared to improve the condition for a few weeks, with a few recurring bumps. Then, it came back again with new bumps every few days and tne existing bumps never really going away. Now I am being put on a 7 day course of amoxicillin and continuing the soap and cream. They ran rheumatologicsl blood tests and I am okay. I do have eczema on my lower legs and my mom and sister both suffer from a variety of skin issues, psoriasis and my mom has rheumatoid arthritis. I also have itch all over my body for about a year but my doctor thinks its anxiety and psychological.  Hoping someone knows what this may be (or can confirm it does look like folliculitis so i can trust my doctors lol) \n\nPosting some pics of before and after    like my wrist, ypull see day one its a large flat red area and day 2 becomes small red bumps. \n\n\n Thanks!'"
antimicrobial,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/xg2xdh/a_couple_of_things_exposed_roots_biological/,"b""A couple of things: exposed roots; biological predisposition to excess calculus and hygienist's magic antimicrobial gel""",,"b""My first question is simple: to what extent are exposed roots problematic? I have had them for years and dentists have never commented on them, but I'm reading online that if there is any significant gum recession then it is actually a proper problem \n\nThe second is basically to do with things I was told ages ago and so can't remember half the details. I have always had fairly bad teeth, with significant amounts of calculus having to be scraped off every visit to the dentist or hygienist. My dentist always told me off for not brushing - and when I protested that I did brush my teeth enough, she would say it must be my brushing technique. But when she actually bothered to check my technique she discovered it was good, and concluded that I must be lying about actually brushing them - with me being like, well, that's nice, dear, but it's simply not true, so what is going on? Needless to say she just stuck to her unfounded point of view. \n\nNow, I remember at some point hearing something about some condition that affects some other body part (I did say I had forgotten details...) that often co-occurred with (and I think caused) poor dental health despite good oral hygiene practices. The condition was something that I either have or plausibly could have - which doesn't narrow it down that much as my health is not great (but the main physical issue is epilepsy; I also have endocrine issues being investigated). \n\nThen at some point the hygienist, after sorting my teeth out, applied some magic antimicrobial gel (or some substance, I don't remember precisely) to my gums. This, combined with my normal oral hygiene, kept my teeth actually clean for the next 6 months. I was given it on one other occasion and it worked then as well. What is this stuff? Evidently I need to ask for it every time (there were a few years where I didn't go at all hence me forgetting). I also wonder if the fact that it was highly effective for me indicates what it is that causes so much build-up in the first place? Is it strange flora, or excessively acidic or alkaline saliva, something like that? \n\n(I don't drink or smoke)"""

I feel as if I\'ve existed for centuries. I can\'t stand it anymore. This whole idea of ""life is short"" is nonsense to me. Life just drags on endlessly and the older I get the more I just can\'t tolerate any of this. \n\nAll I want to do is sleep and when I\'m awake all I do is crave substances- alcohol and benzodiazepines specifically- I don\'t do much of either anymore because I just can\'t mentally or physically handle abusing drugs anymore. I absolutely hate being sober, I\'ve tried it for months on end- it\'s useless. Right now I\'m abusing a muscle relaxant called Baclofen because it is similar to benzos. Without it I would literally just off myself.\n\nI\'m angry that I exist- mom died by suicide when I was 18, I stopped talking to my father when I was 25. I had no normal childhood or teenage years whatsoever. But I\'m mostly over all of that- I don\'t really care anymore. Which is good and bad. \n\nLife in my 20s was at least fun and interesting- lots of friends and partying and adventures. Now it\'s all just worrying about paying off debts, car payments, rent, forcing myself to eat to stay alive when I don\'t want to at all.\n\nI have no intention of seeing age 40 unless some drastic changes happen that make me actually want to be a part of this world. Really there are only two people that keep me alive- my younger brother and my ""sort of"" girlfriend (it\'s complicated) whom also equally just doesn\'t want to be alive, so we understand each other. \n\nBeyond that all my former friendships are basically over as everyone has moved on. Everytime I try and save money to do something like travel I have to spend all my money on my massive debts (made a lot of stupid financial mistakes when I was in my 20s because I had no parental guidance or help whatsoever) so I\'m literally paying for it all and there\'s no way I\'ll be financially stable until like age 40. So there\'s really nothing to look forward to.\n\nI hate being in my 30s- it really feels like I\'m in purgatory and like I should have died years ago.
