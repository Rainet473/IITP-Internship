I was taking Gaviscon advance tablets UK version, which is considered the gold standard in sodium alginate therapy to prevent acid coming from the stomach into the esophagus. It worked like a miracle! It was the only medication that has ever worked for me and gave me a quality of life I havent had in years. \n\nUnfortunately, after starting to take it, I developed rashes on both inside elbows. Biopsy showed it was an allergic reaction to the medication as atopic dermatitis with eosinophils. The medical data sheet for the medication shows that the number one allergic reaction is a rash and if that happens to discontinue the medication. \n\nThe only problem is, I have tried other sodium alginate alternatives and none work. Neither do PPIs and h2 antagonists and all other acid reflux meds Ive been prescribed over the years. This Gaviscon is the only medication that has ever worked for me to stop the throat clearing, painful swallowing and pain in throat, globus, and heartburn. \n\nI am miserable and can only eat a few foods and even then have horrible acid reflux that is affecting my sleep, swallowing, eating, and breathing. \n\nId rather live with the rashes on my elbows than the acid symptoms, so I am thinking of just taking the Gaviscon anyway. I know every body is different and allergies arent an exact science. But what am I looking at here for the worst case scenario if I keep taking the meds? Can this progress from a skin rash to a more immediate serious reaction? What damage am I doing to my body by continuing to take the meds? What can I do to mitigate the damage?'"

At first I thought it was acne, it was just a few red bumps on my legs. Look exactly like pimples. I bought an acne soap and ointment since I dont have any acne products for body. Both are sulfur. The pimples did not go away, there were more and it started itching. This is when I realized it wasnt acne but I thought it would just go away after s while. But it just got worse. Theres so many individual bumps close to each other they formed into big spots. And its insanely itchy, literally the most intense itch Ive ever experienced. Not really itchy during the day but so bad at night I havent been getting sleep. I have noticed that the acne treatments while not making the rash better, did significantly help the itching.  \n\n\nFirst mf \n\nTokd me it was most likely pityriosis rosea and prescribed a steroid cream. I looked that up and no idea why she said that was most likely because it doesnt line up with what I said at all. She told me to come back if it gets worse. It got worse. I did more research to see what I could find and what seems to me to line up the most is some sort of mites. So I started suspecting that.   \n\n\nSecond mf\n\nSays that its probably a fungal infection since it got worse after starting the steroids. She asked me if I see bugs around and I said no because I dont get a lot of bugs here. This made me concerned because bugs arent always visable and mites and stuff fit in that.   \n\n\nThird mf\n\nSaid the rosea diagnosis was a long shot but has no idea what it is and tells me to go to a dermatologist and get scraped. I brought up bugs and she said it doesnt look like bug bites. No crap. Though she did listen when I told her about the itching and prescribed medication for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently waiting on dermatology appointment. Ive found little moving black dots on my legs. One peticular spot was burning and itching so I pulled out a macro lense. It was moving! So yeah Im pretty sure these are bugs. But what and what can I do about them currently?   \n\n\nphotos posted to my profile. How the rash has progressed and of the bugs. There were multiple bugs I seen idk if they uploaded.

The area it covers may differ. Small, round, red spots. No itching, pain, no feeling of any kind. They are flat, no bumps. They do fade when you press on them, but bounce right back. They do not change place. May disappear within a day, may stay the same for multiple days.\n\nIve never had an allergy to anything. No issues with my immune responses ever. Except for multiple medications, it seems. For most of my life Ive been very lucky and have not needed to use any meds besides occasional ibuprofen. Oral medications and this rash are both a new thing to me. \n\nIm 23F, no drinking, smoking or drug use. Currently 173cm / 52,3kg. Low weight due to mental issues. No known medical issues besides the mental ones (ADD, OCD, anxiety).\n\nPrimary complaint is the rash. I first saw these spots when I was taking Zoloft. After a month on this drug I woke up with my thighs covered in red spots like these. Called my doctor, was advised to drop the medication. I did. My doctor saw a picture and said it looks like drug rashes shes seen. The spots disappeared within two days or so. But they kept coming back, so that I had this rash come and go about once a week for a bit after. Then it stopped for good.\n\nA year later I was put on antibiotics. I was on sulfadiazine-trimethoprim for a week. After a week with no symptoms I started seeing these spots on my stomach, slowly spreading. I thought it looked like the rash from Zoloft and felt worried, but I was advised to keep taking my medication. Didnt go well. The rash ended up covering my body from head to toe, got way more intense looking and gave me a mild fever + swollen lymph nodes too. I spent a couple of days in the hospital, but luckily all my blood tests were normal and my skin went back to normal with no signs of anything having happened. I was given steroids and allergy medicine. I was switched on clindamycin. A week of no symptoms, then I started having spots on my chest and shoulders. Antibiotic switched once again. I was able to complete my treatment on azithromycin with no complications.\n\nI saw a doctor afterwards who confirmed I can be called hypersensitive to these two antibiotics, no connection to the Zoloft incident.\n\nNow Ive been taking Concerta. My dose was upped to 27mg a week ago and Im seeing spots on my body. A couple of days ago I saw these spots on my inner thighs. Skipped a day of medication. Rash gone. Today I took it again and currently see a cluster of spots on my stomach. Im starting to be pretty confused. I am able to tell those spots apart from any normal redness or pimples I may have on myself. Why does this keep happening over an over? My health care professionals have been telling me its all a coincidence, or that I can ignore this rash if it does not make me feel bad. But its just so weird.'"

Yesterday I used Nair on my underarms, thinking I was in the clear because I had no reaction to the cream on my legs. However within 10 seconds of applying the Nair to my underarms, it began burning severely. I realized this wasn't normal and went to rinse it off - I maybe had Nair on for 40 seconds to 1 minute total, definitely way under the 3 min minimum & 10 min max. My underarms were in extreme pain, no matter how much I tried to rinse under cool water. It felt like scraping a terrible sunburn. \n\nLooking in the mirror after I got out, I saw these long rash or burn like lines right at the fold of my armpit on both sides, although the right side was worse. I thought maybe my skin reacted badly just in that area and that the burning sensation would reduce with some cool cloth compresses. Unfortunately, it didn't really seem to get better. I applied some Neosporin and took naproxen hoping this would help. I couldn't bandage the irritated area due to the location. \n\nI've been periodically applying Aquaphor and skipping deodorant. Even though it's been extremely painful whenever there's any friction or touch to the area, I thought I probably didn't need medical attention; I would just monitor the reaction and see how things were today. Unfortunately about 24 hours later, the irritated areas look worse and the pain is still just as bad. I can't move my arms up or down without pain. (I will post pictures in a comment.)\n\nMy skin can sometimes be sensitive, but the only known allergies I have are to dust mites and German cockroaches. I also have mild dermatographia. I'm not sure if these are chemical burns or some sort of allergic reaction-related rash, but this only happened on the fold of my underarm, not further up or down in the area and not on my legs. I had not applied deodorant for over 24 hours when I used the Nair either. \n\nI couldn't really find a clear answer of what to do in this situation, so I have a couple of questions:\n\n1. Should I seek medical attention or can I continue caring for this at home? \n2. If you suggest seeking medical attention, should I just contact my PCP and see if they could get me in for an urgent same day appointment? If they're not able to see me today, can it wait for a day or two? I do live pretty close to an ER, but I would prefer not to have to go there unless you would advise it. \n3. If I can just treat this myself, is there anything I should do beyond keeping the areas clean, applying Aquaphor and skipping deodorant until they heal?  \n\n\nThanks so much for any help you can provide!"""

Potential medical malpractice, unethical behavior, the works.'","b'**History:**\n\nHello all. My mother has a lengthy medical history. I will start from the top. She is 44 years old, was diagnosed (but incorrectly staged) with HER2 positive breast cancer 5 years ago. She was originally staged at Stage II, but before her double mastectomy she got a second opinion from another hospital, where a panel of doctors reviewed her scans and re-staged her at Stage IIIB. From what I can recall, I know that she obviously had malignant tumor(s?) in the breast tissue itself, on both sides, and I know for a fact that it had spread to the lymph nodes on both sides of her body. She had another tumor that I do not know was ever classified, but they considered it to be in the ""breast region"" so treated the tumor as though it was a part of her breast cancer. So I imagine that would be considered a tumor in the chest wall (?). She successfully beat cancer a few months after harsh treatment, and had a double mastectomy and affected lymph nodes removed. Successfully completed radiation, and has been in remission since early 2019. After the mastectomy, she also had spacers and eventually implants put in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Presenting problems:**\n\nFast forward to recently. She had an unrelated MRI or CT (can\'t remember which) roughly a year ago that showed a 1.3cm (?) cyst on one of her ovaries. No follow-up was recommended for the cyst I believe, they ruled it to not be a cause for concern. About a month ago, she had a regular visit with her OB, where they did an ultrasound to show that the cyst had grown to 3cm. Further imaging and tests showed that it was just a cyst, no malignancy. After my mother\'s mastectomy, I thought it would be wise of her to also have a hysterectomy. Given her age and her positive HPV status, I just thought it was the best course of action, but she was against it. Now with the cyst, she automatically jumped to talking about a hysto. In the same day, she had a biopsy on one of her breasts, because she had some kind of skin thing that she described as ""a bruise that hasn\'t gone away"". Biopsy showed no malignancy for whatever it was, but the biopsy left her with a hole in her skin, about the size of hole punch. When you looked through the hole, you could literally see the surface of her implant, and if you were smart enough to shine a flashlight on it, you could clearly tell it was her implant you were looking at. I don\'t know if that\'s standard practice or what. It seems odd to me, like you\'re asking for an infection that way, but we were aware of that risk so she kept it covered after the biopsy.\n\nSo, hopping back to the hysterectomy. Her OB also thought that at this point with her clear symptoms of the beginning of menopause, age, HPV status, cancer history, and cyst, that it was probably a good time to talk about a hysto. My mother eagerly agreed, not wanting even the smallest hairline of a possibility of cancer ever being in the conversation ever again. She was scheduled very quickly for a hysterectomy. In the meantime, the hole in her skin was not closing. At one point the skin seemed to thin and stretch around, creating a smaller hole but thinner skin, which I imagine was the hole closing. However, even two weeks after the biopsy, the skin remained red, warm to the touch, and irritated. She revisits the oncology office that did the biopsy. **Here comes the fucked up part.**\n\nThe first person that visits her in the oncology office (PA? I don\'t know, wasn\'t there) examines the hole in her skin ***WITHOUT GLOVES***\\- that part I think needs to be made very abundantly clear. This physician immediately says that we\'re looking at a scab, not her implant. My mother is insistent. ""That\'s not a scab"" she says. This physician brings in another physician, who is thankfully gloved, and this physician- a true genius, probably top of their class- decides they can\'t tell. So they do what I did (not a doctor or brilliant by any means) the commonsense approach, turned out the lights and used their flashlight and confirmed that we were in fact looking at her implant. This doctor says ""Walk quickly across the street to your plastic surgeon, he needs to see this. I think the implant may need to come out"".\n\n**So that was the long story.** Here comes the shorter part. The plastic surgeon was on the fence about removing the implant. He decided to try sewing the hole, and seeing what happened. Shocker: it didn\'t fix anything. I don\'t think his actions made anything worse- I think it was ""worse"" to begin with. The skin became more inflamed and irritated. Plastics said ""Well add on implant removal to your scheduled hysterectomy. If anything gets worse or you start to feel weird, go to the hospital immediately"". So exactly that happens. 4 days before surgery she starts to feel off and immediately goes to the hospital. They check her out, WBC and bloodwork are good, she checks in with her surgeons who give her the OK to go back home. That lasted one whole day. Closer to the end of the day 1 day later, she starts feeling significantly worse- infection feels like its traveling, shoulder starts hurting, head is pounding, more skin on her breast is now red and inflamed, hole is oozing. So she finds herself back in the hospital. WBC is not only elevated, but a good jump from where it had been previously. Different WBC components are also not only elevated, some are now double what they were 36 hours ago. So she\'s admitted, given more IV antibiotics, and she stays until the day of her surgery.\n\n**Surgery:**\n\nSurgery goes well. Very well. Cultures are taken of the infection, sent off for testing. Recovery was brutal at first but she\'s exactly 1 week post-op now and doing very well. However, we just got the results back from the culture of the infection, and I have never been more pissed off and ready to attack someone in my entire life. **The culture from the infection states this exactly:** ""Occasional staphylococcus epidermidis. Possible skin contaminant. No further workup. No neutrophils noted. No anaerobes isolated."" One quick Google search tells me that this type of staph infection is commonly called the ""accidental pathogen"" and is most likely caused by MEDICAL DEVICE CONTAMINATION. So, correct me if I\'m wrong. My mother has been a nurse and worked in the lab pretty much her entire life. She knows how to care for a wound, and was properly taking care of the wound and keeping it covered. No one I know has any present staph infection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes this mean that my mother needed to have an additional surgery on top of her hysto because of SOMEONE ELSE\'S mistake??? How easy is it to obtain this type of infection on your own, in your own home?? She doesn\'t go to the gym or public places (other than the hospital I guess) and she most certainly kept it covered, but also, it\'s on her breast- so not only covered to keep it sanitary, but also under her bra, under her shirt. I\'m just incredibly frustrated because her plastic surgeon said from the beginning that what they did (which part of it he\'s never specified) is not right and should have never happened. It really doesn\'t help my faith in my local hospitals that are supposed to take care of me.\n\nSo please, feel free to drop any information you have, medical mumbojumbo and all. I want to know everything I can about this type of infection- how easily you can pick it up, how easily it is transferred, and how likely it is that she obtained it from either the biopsy or the medical office that examined her without gloves.'"

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12rk1hq/unexpected_weight_gain_from_medication/,b'Unexpected weight gain from medication',"b'50M 5\'8"" 185lbs\n\nHydrocortisone 30mg/day  \nLevothyroxine 100mcg/day  \nOccasional aleve & THC  \n\n\nSome background:  \nI was born with Septo-Optic Dysplasia which, among other things, really threw a spanner in the works of my endocrine system.  One of those other things is that I have weighed \\~160lbs for my entire adult life regardless of what I eat, even living a *very* sedentary lifestyle.  Well I discovered some time ago that, among the various other issues I was aware of, my body doesn\'t produce (any/enough) cortisol so I\'ve been seeing an endocrinologist who has prescribed hydrocortisone as replacement therapy, plus levothyroxine for a similar issue with my thyroid.  I\'ve been taking them for about 8 months now and have noticed some weirdness with my weight.  I get weighed at every doctor visit (which is the only way I was even aware of this, \\~35 years of not having to worry about my weight meant I didn\'t even own a bathroom scale), and the first couple I didn\'t notice anything.  By the 3rd visit which was after 3 months I noticed that I had lost 10lbs but I didn\'t think much about it because while it was outside the normal range of fluctuations I figured it was just a temporary thing.  However, on my 4th and most recent visit after another 3 months I noticed that I had gained 30lbs which was a shock to say the least.  Weirdly, some of the fat I have gained has been around my hips and knees, especially on the inside above and below the knee, and it feels kind of hard and the joints feel a bit stiff now and even sore sometimes.\n\nI bought a bathroom scale and downloaded an app to help me track my weight and I\'ve been weighing myself every morning since my last doctor\'s visit (about a month ago) and I continue to slowly gain weight despite cutting snacks and junk food out of my diet and spending 30 minutes on an exercise bike most mornings and it\'s getting to the point where I\'m getting concerned.  I know levothyroxine can affect metabolism and weight so I stopped taking that for a week and it didn\'t seem to change anything, so I then stopped taking both of the new meds for a week and the rate of gain has slowed somewhat, so it seems to be the hydrocortisone causing it.\n\nMy actual questions:  \nIs this normal?  I\'ve never had to deal with weight gain before so I have no idea what\'s normal and what isn\'t, but losing and then gaining weight seems weird, having semi-hard fat around my knees that makes them feel stiff and sore sometimes seems weird, etc.  Is there anything I can do about this, any other form of cortisol I could take that wouldn\'t cause the weight gain?  Is not taking the hydrocortisone a reasonable response to this?  My doctor warned me that I could die if I stopped taking it and got sick or was in a car accident or something, but I\'ve gone my entire life without it even being really sick on occasion and not had any issues so I dunno how to evaluate that warning.  Is this entirely normal and everyone else deals with it all the time and I\'m just freaking out because I\'ve been abnormal all my life?'"

Desk job, recurring moderate exercise (light running/walking 2-3x a week).\n\nTrying to determine appropriate course of action for a hellacious skin rash/infection that seems to have spawned from my armpits.\n\nI have an appointment with my GP next Thursday, but 8 days is a long time and Im not sure what else theyll do for me other than give me a steroid cream and send me on my way.\n\nCurrently unsure if this was started by contact dermatitis or a fungal infection from working out (Im regular runner), but it seems to be spreading somewhat aggressively which makes me think its fungal (or worse)?\n\nDespite starting in my armpits, its spread outwards up my arm and towards my chest.  The rash on my arm has a slightly bubbly appearance, and the rash underneath my armpits/on my ribs is scalier in appearance.  It feels like its starting to spread everywhere  pretty much my entire arms and chest feel itchy/irritated at this point.\n\nSo far Ive: thrown away my old loofah, only using towels once in shower/when drying off, tried switching deodorants (I switched from Old Spice deodorant to Mitchum antiperspirant but I think the Mitchum honestly made it much worse), currently taking an epsom salt bath 1x a day, scrubbing my entire body with Nizoral 1x a day, and applying Lotrimin antifungal spray 2x a day at night after shower and in the morning.\n\nMy main issue is I feel like this is spreading all over my body and Im not sure how to get a grip on this.\n\nI have a crystal spray deodorant coming in tomorrow so I can get back off of the Old Spice, but after that Im fresh out of ideas other than aggressively continuing with the epsom salt bath and anti fungal soaps and Lotrimin.  The spread pattern looks remarkably fungus-y and it honestly has gotten worse since these photos (taken last Friday).\n\nCan anyone help me get a grip on this? Thank you so much!!'"

After skin test (many environmental triggers, high allergies to trees, pollen, grass, dust) but low food allergies, allergist started modest antihistamine and Flonase and presumed oral allergy syndrome. GI put me on nystatin in case of thrush and rushed me in for an endoscopy () and saw no indications of esophageal allergy or thrush, only minor lower reflux. Finally saw ENT who viewed irritation around vocal chords.\n\nLast Friday, 20 hours post Endoscopy and right after scope, noticed a feint rash, small raised red bumps by the thousands, across my left hip to my right, south of ribcage, not on back. Still accompanied by swallow trouble that led to a full blown sore throat. In subsequent days, it has grown to full angry red rash, splotches, with the bump forming big red continents. By day 2 it was on thighs and feet. By day 4 it was so large and aggravated in all the areas, spread to groin, and had begun to itch albeit mildly. Also sore throat was now wicked. \n\nI should say, other than nystatin, nothing new in my routine. No new foods, no new meds there WAS a new detergent, but I wasnt the one washing with it (my clean clothes were still from the old detergent to the best of my knowledge) Still, I switched it to a hypo allergenic tide pod and rewatched everything. Ive ordered the old detergent as well, just in case.\n\nDay 3 and 4 made the full doctor rounds. \n\nDermatologist said probably allergy or viral but offered no course of action beyond topical steroid. Allergist thinks not an allergy rash (saying hives normally pop up, go down, change, spread dont normally start in one large area and not move or change just slowly blow up bigger despite simple diet etc.) she said throat looked incredibly red and actually suggested scarlet fever. My pcp suggested eliminating anything Id been eating that could possibly be exacerbating (its a small list as of now). My surgeon friend suggested it was time to take my allergists advice and get tests run on viruses. SO went to ER for full work up: they ruled out Covid, strep (from a rapid), common respiratory viruses, measles, mcas, and stds (from both personal history and tests). All doctors have seemed to agree its not: 1. Complications from endoscopy, 2. Shingles or zoster, 3. An immediate threat to me\n\nBut its slowly growing, is so angry looking, and gets itchier as we go. Dry sore throat is upsetting and there are some mild body aches in my stomach and lower back that are not debilitating but are disconcerting. Doctors are saying viral but have no suggestion of what virus it could be (I have no fever btw) or allergy but we cant locate what allergen would do this. I do have an epi pen just in case.\n\nIve been given steroid shots (Dexamethason and kenalog) and a topical cream and told to return to the dermatologist for a biopsy if it doesnt get better. Anything Im not considering? Anything I should do? Is this the end of the line? Its just.. a bit unnerving to have your bodies skin explode.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13h9kfs/doctors_will_not_listen_after_reading_incorrect/,"b'Doctors will not listen after reading incorrect medical information from years ago. We need advice, please.'","b""Hello! Bit of a long story, I apologize, but we really need some advice if anyone can help. I will add a TLDR at the end.\n\nI'll also add that my partner knows far more about dealing with doctors than I do, I only really understand what he has explained to me regarding the situation. Maybe someone here would know more?\n\nMy partner has a history of many medical issues, both physical and mental. He's had an undiagnosed autoimmune discorder of some-sort for years, and been going to doctors since he was around 10 years old for issues regarding that alongside scoliosis, joint pain, sleep issues, severe depression, etc.\n\nThe problem is that when he was young, his mother was extremely abusive. Of the many things she did, one was lying to doctors. Whenever they would go to a doctor, she would lie on the spot about random behavioral symptoms, disregard very serious health concerns, and try to make herself look sad (for attention/pity I guess??).\n\nDoctors refused to believe anything was wrong, and he has been marked down for being an emotional hypochondriac on his chart for a large portion of his life, and as being disrespectful (for being upset when he was not being listened to or ignored.\n\nHe moved out to live with me at 18, roughly 5 years ago now. The thing is, because of his past chart entries, nearly every doctor we've seen in the last several years has either brushed him off as someone seeking drugs or has simply passed him off to another doctor. It's been an endless loop of being sent from one doctor to the next and back to the first again, if he is even listened to at all\n\nI think, ideally, removing or atleast correcting false/exaggerated information from years ago might help. But we also live in another state hours away now. So if anyone has been in a similar situation before or could offer any advice at all, about any of this, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend had abusive mother, has a very poor medical record because of this, which causes all doctors to disregard him as just somone seeking drugs. He needs help with medical issues but cannot find anyone to listen. Hoping it is possible to remove old medical record information from childhood in hopes that he will be respected in the future."""

I do not drink, smoke or do drugs, ever.\n\nIt started out at least a couple months ago (if not even more than that) and would come and go but it was itchy and frankly a little raw. It was (as still is) on my inner thighs, somewhat rubbing against my testicles. They are red spots in a patch together on either side, symmetrically, and the skin where my legs meet my privates was very raw. I believe the initial cause was after going to a beach and wearing underwear under my swimsuit which I believe the wet skin created friction and developed into a chafing that I ignored for some reason. The itching continued and eventually I started to use generic hydrocortisone on it and that did help with the itch and that has gone away. There was also some dry skin and that is no longer an issue. It may be a little embarrassing, but I will still include it: I enjoy wearing diapers as a fetish and thought this could be diaper rash so I tried a diaper rash cream (Desitin) but that didnt seem to help. I also tried Vaseline with and without that cream but didnt notice much difference in the rash going away. I asked a friend who is also interested in this fetish and hes been through it too. He suggested I switch underwear (I was wearing cotton briefs before, but now I wear polyester/spandex boxer briefs) and within a week of switching underwear I noticed a definite change and I havent itched since and the rashy area has cleared up, but it still comes back. I wish I could post a picture. Ive continued using hydrocortisone on the spots at least twice a day. I dont have any dry skin anymore and the color has improved, there are still some red spots that cluster together and come and go, I dont understand why it wont just go away if the hydrocortisone is helping it. Could it be taking time to clear up since Ive neglected it for some time? There are definite signs of improvement which Im happy for, but the fact the small red spots still pop up annoys and slightly concerns me. Should I be trying something else stronger than hydrocortisone? Ive seen recommendations that products like Body Glide and Gold Bond Friction Defense helped with this inner thigh chafing, could one of those help clear the rash or probably not since its not affecting me with burning or itching anymore and its the rash itself I want to get rid of?'"

This continued through March 17th. He seemed fine the entirety of March 18th. On March 19th he started presenting with a full body light petechial rash and fevers. Appetite, fluid in take and behavior were all very normal. Would occasionally become sleepy with the fevers. Fevers would come down with Tylenol. Over the next two weeks the fevers became more frequent but were still easily treated with Tylenol. On March 31st he began to lose energy and didnt really want to get out of bed. On April 1st he started refused food and drink. The early hours of April 2nd he began vomiting. We had several appointments with his PCM, urgent care, and nurse telehealth during these two weeks. All advising its just something viral and should resolve on its own. After refusing food and drink and then vomiting we decided we couldnt wait the 24 hours to his next appointment and took him to the emergency room. He began requiring blow by O2 while sleeping from night one at the hospital. The petechial rash started to become severe in places where he had any medium to heavy pressure (blood pressure cuff, being held for accessing his port a cath).  On April 4th he began needing supplemental o2, between 1.5-5L. After a week in the hospital he was diagnosed with a severe CMV vierma infection. He was started on gancylovir to treat on April 10th. After a few weeks of treatment his CMV levels have finally come down to the 100s (as of early this week). On 4/13 he was out on high flow o2 due to hypoxia. He continued to range in requirements of 15L-30L and 60%FIO2 -100% FIO2. We were advised his lungs would begin to heal as his cmv number declined which has clearly not been the case. On 5/1 he was rapid-ed to the ICU due to expected impending respiratory failure with hypoxia. In the icu he had episodes or high hr, blood pressure, and low O2. However, these episodes were short lived at the beginning and after they were over he would go back to his normal goofy self. Over the next 36 hours his episodes became longer and more frequent. He has a planned intubation set for May 3rd at 6am and a planned brohncoscopy set for May 3rd at 9am. Original plans were to begin attempting ex-intubation post procedure. However at approximately 3am on May 3rd he had an episode that did not resolve. He was placed on a ventilator which failed due to CO2 build up, oscillator was attempted and failed due to CO2 build up. He was then placed on bivalve ecmo on max pediatric settings. He remains on max ecmo settings to present day. He has since been diagnosed with ARDS. He has had an extensive infectious disease work up and rheumatology work up. Every test result has come back negative. Tests show high levels of inflammation. Doctors at our current hospital refuse to do a lung biopsy due to expected death during or as a direct result of the procedure. Please help. We are being told were reaching the end of our options here. We have a second opinion request put in with Boston Childrens Hospital but are willing to travel anywhere that may be able to help him. I can provide any and all test results you need to help and the team here is typically willing to run more with plausible explanation. He has a complex medical history as well be no full encompassing genetic diagnosis. \n\nHe is currently on anti fungals, antivirals, and antibacterials. He also has a BMX drip for a diuretic.

I\'ll get straight to the point: I\'m a 29F with a mystery illness that has been eluding doctors for the last 10 years. It\'s getting to the point where I\'m thinking about suicide because I\'m unable to live this way anymore; coming to Reddit with this is pretty much my last resort. I\'ll start off by listing my symptoms from most bothersome to least bothersome, my medical history, and then I\'ll tell you what tests I\'m currently aware of having been done. I have the actual results available but be aware that they are not in English and it\'s over 20 pages long.\n\nSymptoms:\n\n- Fatigue : this is the main symptom. I\'m extremely tired all of the time. I sleep up to 16hrs a day. Sometimes I get sudden bouts of fatigue where resisting falling asleep is nearly impossible, I usually deal with this by just sleeping. I try to exercise but my physical fitness doesn\'t seem to improve at all despite going to the gym 3 times a week.\n- Diarrhea/stomach cramps/gas/bloating : I have diarrhea  literally every day. The stool is pure liquid. It\'s accompanied by horrific stomach cramps that can last for hours\n- Rash : there\'s a rash in my face that never really goes away. It\'s particularly bad around my eyes and mouth. I sometimes get patches of rash in the folds of my arms or in my armpits. They\'re itchy and very sensitive, sometimes swollen.\n- Vertigo : I get spells of dizziness. These spells can go from anywhere between a couple of minutes to several hours. Several times it has gotten to a point where I have to lay down and wait for it to be over because even just turning my head makes me nauseous.\n- Low blood pressure : I experience episodes of low blood pressure that often go hand in hand with the vertigo.\n- Abnormal vision : my vision will often ""swim"" amd I\'ll have trouble focusing my eyes.\n- Allergic rhinitis : runny nose, dry mouth, dry eyes.\n- Excessive sweating\n- Difficulty regulating temperature : I tend to feel very hot in the morning, throughout the day I go back and forth between way too hot and way too cold.\n- Cold extremities : sometimes my feet and hands are like ice and just won\'t warm up no matter what I do.\n- Migraines : these are actual migraines with halos and sensitivity to light and sound. I also get a lot of regular headaches.\n- Neck and shoulder pain : could also be related to an old sports injury and general shitty posture.\n- Paleness : could be related to other symptoms but I sometimes look paler than a ghost.\n- Anxiety : although I obviously have reasons to be anxious I\'m still mentioning it because it feels abnormal. I get random panic attacks that seem to come out of nowhere.\n- Cold sores : I get way more cold sores than normal people. I have one about every 2 weeks. Could be related to the rashes around my mouth of course.\n- Dandruff\n- Frequent urination\n\nI also experience some depression but to be honest I think everyone would be depressed if they were going through this. I\'m very slightly overweight, being 5ft3 and 140lbs.\n\nMedical history:\n\n- RCPD (basically your lower esophageal sphincter is too tight and won\'t let you burp), I got a botox injection that fixed this\n- Stomach ulcers\n- Eczema (as a child)\n- Lyme (as a child)\n- Arthritis in C4 vertebra, very mild, dr said it would not explain any of my symptoms except some of the neck pain\n- HPV : I had HPV in 2018, this is likely unrelated as my symptoms started long before that\n\nTests that have already been done:\n\n- RBC, platelets, hemoglobin, hematocrit : normal\n- WBC : high end of normal\n- BMP and CMP : normal\n- Cholesterol : normal\n- Iron : normal\n- Vitamin D : normal\n- TSH, T3, T4 : normal\n- (edit) Cortisol morning, evening : normal\n- Coagulation : normal\n- STI tests : normal except HPV\n- ANA : dubious, further testing for fluorescence and ANA-associated rheumatoid diseases revealed nothing, dsDNA was positive in first test but negative the second time\n- C3, C3d, C4 : normal\n- RX Thorax : normal\n- MRI cervical, thorasis and head : normal except the arthritis mentioned above\n- Ultrasound abdomen : normal\n- Gastroscopy : H. Pylori found, another one after treatment for ulcers was normal\n- Lactose intolerance : mildly lactose intolerant\n- (edit) Stool : don\'t have the specific results but they were normal, no mucus and no inflammatory markers\n- (edit) Tilt table test : normal\n\nMedication I\'m currently taking:\n\n- Neurontin : for the migraines, helpfulness is dubious\n- Cetirizine\n- Valaciclovir\n- A bunch of supplements, vitamin D, B12, magnesium, others\n\nThings I have tried that did not work:\n\n- Pantoprazole\n- Pepcid AC\n- Omega 3/6\n- Several different SSRIs and SNRIs\n- Bilastine\n- Others that I don\'t remember off the top of my head\n- (edit) Low FODMAP and low histamine diets\n\nI\'m sorry for the length of this post. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have, I will answer them to the best of my abilities. I really hope someone will be able to make sense of all this. Thank you for reading this.\n\nEdit: Reddit is acting up and won\'t allow me to read the last 30 or so comments. I\'m assuming they\'re going to appear eventually and I will read all of them at that time, but for now I\'m unable to respond, I\'m really sorry.

His temp was 100.2. This was around 6pm. He sweated like crazy all night.\n\nThursday morning he woke up with a rash on his arms and stomach. It started simple, like someone who maybe used a soap they were allergic to. This was 8am. We went to urgent care. His fever was then 102.6. His rash had heavily spread. Arms, fingers, hands, legs, chest, back, butt. Urgent care ran COVID, mono and strep. All negative. Gave him Toradol. Brought the temp down to 100.5. Doctor said he wasnt very concerned, if things worsened, go to ER. That night the rash on his legs went from overall red splotches to very bright red, almost hickey like spots. \n\nFriday morning he woke up and his feet were swollen and it was very painful to walk. He said they were very tingly. The rash was worse and now it was itchy. We went to the ER. They ran a CBC panel and did urine, everything came back normal. Temp was down to 98.8. Doctor said although the rash was scary to us it was not what shed deem scary to a medical professional. Mentioned it turned white when pressed on, was all over and wasnt near his mouth, genitals or nose. All good signs. She said he likely had a viral exanthem and we needed to wait it out. She said he was showing symptoms children usually do with viral exanthem in terms of the rash, but it wasnt that concerning. She prescribed Hydroxyzine. He had been taking benedryl, but it wasnt helping. Advil and Tylenol was also minimal help. \n\nToday, Saturday, rash has not changed. His legs have now purple almost broken blood vessel like spots all over. He said his feet were feeling okay this AM, but were painful and swollen by mid day. His fingers and hands are tingly too now. His fingers feel cold, not freezing but definitely not warm. He says he isnt itchy anymore. Temp is still normal now, 98.8. \n\nI am really scared. Especially seeing the purple broken blood vessels on his legs. Im worried whatever is happening will effect his skin long term. \n\nWe have not introduced any new foods, detergents, lotions, etc. No recent working in our yard or near plants. No travel recently.

Started bleeding as I was walking out of the office, went to the bathroom and it was running down my legs. Went to the desk for help, so frustrated the drs kept asking me what I was upset about and if everything was alright at home. Everythings fine at home Im in MASSIVE pain and blood is pouring out of me! They gave me a pad and I lay down for 15 mins they asked AGAIN what was really going on. I wanted to leave. Dr took my blood pressure and gave me another pad as Id soaked through the first and said she is going to call me this afternoon to check in.\n Missed the call and received a text saying they hope Im fine and to call if Im concerned. Theyre closed now. I just want to know why I would bleed that much? The pain and bleeding is much much less now, but Ive had two mirenas before and this was nothing like either.

At first the doctor thought it was hand foot and mouth disease, but that's not the case now. They can vary from a few small spots, to raised and widespread over her body (or even a combination). It seems to be the worst in the warm months, and less frequent in the cool months. We tried tracking food and medication to see if anything was triggering it but no luck. No medications seem to help (tried allergy meds, steroids, topical creams). Sometimes her hands and feet turn red and swell. Most unusual of all, she says the rash *does not bother her.* She says it does not itch or hurt. She feels fine! We saw an allergist, and while she did have very small reactions to almost everything they tested, the doctor said they were likely false positives. No real answers from the allergist. We saw a pediatric rheumatologist, and they ruled out JRA. We saw a pediatric endocrinologist, and thought maybe she has Hashimoto's but her bloodwork was improved by the time we saw him and he said to follow up in a year. Next step, we are going to see a dermatologist, and maybe infectious disease?? Maybe I shouldn't be so concerned because she says she feels fine. I just can't help but worry this is the sign of something more serious that needs to be addressed.

Jan 2022 was extremely fatigued I couldnt stop sleeping felt very off. feb 2022 developed congestion , dry watery eyes , night sweats and then one night I woke out of sleep gasping for air and was extremely out of breath I was sweating like crazy I felt almost delusional I felt so ill. The next few nights I had similar but less intense experience. During this time it was found that my bathroom had been leaking and mold was found and cleaned up ( mostly) I had taken about 3 days off work. I then returned to work and started to have a lot of chest pain, racing heart. I couldnt walk far with out becoming out of breath and having severe chest pain. I ended up having such severe pain I went to hospital and they told me I had chest wall inflammation and to take Advil and  rushed me out. I took about 5 days off work I felt okay when resting however laying flat I could not breath and I had a lot of pain at night so I propped my self up and felt better. I started to feel alot better and I returned to work. I kept having shortness of breath, chest pain, hot flashes, alot more anxiety then normal. It really seemed like out of nowhere my heart would just pound. At night I kept gasping for air it got to the point I was scared to sleep. My family doctor was away for all of this and I had seen her replacement who suggested I had costochronditus. So I went to my physio and he was a-bit stumped on that as he didnt think that would effect breathing so much as it wasnt just painful to breathe it actually was hard to breathe. My family doctor returned and said she thinks its my hormones and long story short shes been blaming it on estrogen withdrawal  do to hysterectomy. However my endocrinologist who is well known for working with trans patients said its EXTREMELY-unlikely especially as I had been on testosterone for so long with out a period .

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13yt9tj/can_you_possibly_solve_this_or_provide_insight/,b'can you possibly solve this or provide insight? (Long) (Very interesting case)',"b""First and last post here! \n\nThis may be a long read, but I truly, truly appreciate it if everyone would stick around and add their insight to this. \n\nBackground: 21 male, 5'10, Caucasian (Scottish, Slovakian, French) \nLocation: Canada \n\nI have 2 sisters, 2 nephews, and 1 niece, which is important to factor in, and I'll explain why briefly.\n\nWhen I was just little used to light up bright red only on my face and neck typically only in stressful or public situations (terrible social anxiety), it wasn't itchy, just hot and red and I would sweat a lot.  According to my mom (54), she used to get the same thing in front of people but eventually grew out of it. \n\nNow regarding my niece and nephews, they also get red in the face and have trouble regulating body temperature but not due to any type of anxiety, as it stands we could call it idiopathic and it resembles Lupus or maybe rosacea however - my oldest nephew also has some skin problems and my youngest often gets fevers and hives from many things but treats it with things like advil. \n\nThe above is important in MY case I believe because when I was around 13 I was put on 20mg of cipralex (2014), in October 2019 (17) I went into anaphylaxis for the first time due to amoxicillin which I took due to sinus congestion (mom also has chronically) and I had it lying around from a previous infection, the anaphylaxis scared me into not taking any medication so I abruptly cut down my cipralex and for some reason believed I wouldn't need them anymore. \n\nAfter doing this, I one day woke up with the most severe depersonalisation and derealisation anyone could ever have alongside a gross number of other discontinuation symptoms which lasted over 3 months and eventually subsided after reinstating 10-15mg of the same medication, the most IMPORTANT part of this is I had developed Tinnitus and anisacoria after this AND I couldn't take the meds anymore because I developed symptoms of seratonin toxicity so I had to get off all together and just deal with it. \n\nFast forward to 2021-2022 and now things are serious, my body is behaving terribly since I've changed things up and it's worth mentioning that the rash / redness I used to only get on my face and neck had began to progress down to my chest and eventually to my legs but it's not itchy and only happens in the sun, in stressful situations/ conditions. That's the least of it, I began getting constipated by almost ALL foods and chicken and rice were my only tolerable foods (until they weren't), I wasn't getting rashes but it's like I developed this hypersensitivity in the signals from my stomach, it began feeling tight and caused me to be severely constipated for over 33 days (not exaggerated), my blood sugar was 1.3, you could say I was intolerant to almost everything but not allergic. \n\nThis is where things got weird, at this point I've seen almost all of the BEST specialists in Canada and been to the best hospitals which costed me a lot of money that I just happened to coincidentally have (now I don't) and a lot of time, as I mentioned I had been extremely constipated UNTIL I received saline solution VIA IV injection overnight, I got home a day later and had the most excruciatingly painful poop ever and it was disgusting - I know it was from the saline IV because this happened more than once and that was the only thing I was issued other than the mix of vitamins (Please explain this if possible!) \n\nNow, I got the blockage out and still continued to have serious issues and kept myself near the hospitals (in Toronto), I had more needle holse in my arm than any addict ever (painful) due to the amount of blood work done but now I was down to 98 lbs from 184 (I was kind of overweight prior to all of this) and I had given up so I decided (f it, I'll have what I want) and started to intake calories again by what I thought was healthier (Boba, cauliflower bites etc) than what I used to have thankfully toronto had these options. \n\nAnyway, this is what leads us to the most current circumstances/ situation - everything I ate / eat lots of carbs, sugar or fibre  my body temperature increases and I get really gassy, my veins dilate massively, I become lethargic, low blood pressure and I have a red face BUT when I take things like vitamin C, D, Zinc, Dandelion, Burdock Root, Reishi (yes I taught myself natural medicine because I had to), the symptoms reverse BUT I get this 'tight' feeling in my stomach which is why I describe the whole hypersensitivity thing because I can feel almost everything. I get the tightness, the gas gets trapped, and my body temp decreases. \n\nNow I'll give a brief on the important tests I've done due to suspicions I and few doctors had about specific diseases: \nHATS(tryptase and genes), MASTOCYTOSIS(c-kit), POLYCYTHEMIA VERA (jak 2), LEUKEMIA (bcr-abl), MYELOPROLIFERATIVE NEOPLASMS(calr), PORPHYRIA, ANEMIA (MANY TYPES), C3, C4, CRP, INR, ANTI DNA, LEUKOCYTES, PROTEIN (urine), IMMUNOGLOBULINS, THYROID ANTIBODIES AND FUNCTION, DOUBLE STRAND ANTIBODIES, RHUMATOID FACTOR (10 >14), VITAMIN D,MRI'S, CT'S(brain amd stomach), ECHO'S, ULTRASOUNDS (of everything), ALLERGY SKIN TESTING, SERATONIN(urine) and maybe more that I didn't see. \n\nThe results that were 'positive' and stood out + dates discovered: \n\nThyroglobulin antibodies >184 (2023)\nThyroperoxidase antibodies >135 (2023)\nC3 >89 (2021)\nBilirubin >30 (2021)\nAlbumin >53 (2021)\nUrate >192 (2021) \nBetween 2021-2022, at my worst, I had consistently low wbc and neutrophils, whether from malnutrition or something else.

I'm dying to know what's going on and I haven't given up, I've had one person be there with me through the entirety of this and they know good and well it's not like me, all of that just made things worse but I understand.\n\nI used to be into modifying cars (i had 4 already), boxing, weight lifting, bmxing, jogging, etc. \n\nYet people still thought I simply went mad.\n\nThe ONLY relief I've had through this is when I did strict carnivore diet, had the sedation for my colonoscopy AND when I ate a Scotch bonnet pepper - it relived everything for about 30 seconds (oddly) and I kid you not, I'm not sure the mechanism behind these things but they're which makes me think it's neurological? Nothing has remissed me to my old self completely.\n\nI've also taken several different medications, including (mostly under the suspicions of mast cell disease)\nPrednisone \nDiphenhydramine\nFamitodine\nCeterizine \nCompounded cromolyn Sodium\nCompounded hydroxyzine\nAspirin \nAlka seltzer \nA few more I can't remember \nNone of which provided relief and had rather strange side effects such as clicking in my jaw and tight stomach.\n+Meditation, Chiropractors, Accupresure etc.\n\nMain symptoms: \nGassy 24/7 no matter what!\nOn empty stomach (after colonoscopy prep, for example). My stomach was burning but no gas. \nIncreased body temp on an empty stomach (100+) \nIncreased body temp (external), lethargy, shortness of breath, diarrhoea(at worst) typically from carbs even healthy ones, caffeine (dark chocolate & green tea), empty colon, external heat and now from almost everything. \n'Tight' stomach sensation or squeezing from specific substances / supplements and decreased external body temperature.\nBones or joints popping / cracking too much\nTinnitus \nUnequal pupils size (anisacoria) \n\nNOTE: I become lethargic / fatigued and weak when my body temperature increases and my veins get larger. \n\nWhen I take/ took said supplements (vitamin D, C, Zinc , Reishi, Turkey tail) My finger nails actually used to go purple at the same time my stomach felt tight and my body temp decreased and gave me some energy.\n\nNOTE: My joints have been consistently popping and cracking more frequently than before, too, regardless of my nutrition or supplements.\n\nAs you can probably tell, I'm pretty desperate for ideas, I am / was supposed to have my whole genome sequenced and be reffered to a geneticist weather or not that's actually happening but until then, I need to hear from the community what I can do, I don't think I can get to the U.S either if that's even necessary.\n\nI'm not here pity, I'm just messed up from all of this and appreciate any ideas from any individuals. \n\nMy ideas (neurological / hypothalamic disorder? thyroid disorder? Increased TNF? Metabolic acidosis?)\n\nThank you very much for reading this far and taking the time to think over this if you have! I really appreciate it!.\n\nThe only 'good' that has come from this from my perspective is that I learned an abundance about body functions, natural health, psychology, and I was capable of making a few books out of it. None of it has been easy and I wish I could feel 'normal' again, I don't care if some doctors disbelieve me anymore, I know it's hard to figure out due to clean looking tests but I couldn't be more serious."""

I am 21F and have been wondering about some bumps on my hand for awhile. I do not currently have insurance, though starting in September my job will be providing me some. A few months ago, probably early February, 2 bumps appeared on my right hand. The bumps were similar to pimples, but never had a white head that showed pus or anything like that. The bumps would occasionally itch as well. I would try popping them, but they wouldnt pop, then a few times when I scratched them they wouldnt bleed but it seemed as though they were burst open. These bumps have not left my hand in these months. Recently, as of 2 days ago, a rash-like growth has been added along with these bumps, making my hand even more itchy. I have not changed anything, from the soap I use to the makeup I use, everything is the exact same. I will be attaching 2 photos, one that just shows my hand and the slight rash then one circling the 2 bumps that have been there for awhile. I am essentially asking for advice moving forward, such as if I should seek medical attention sooner than later and if they are signs for concern. Anything helps, and I appreciate any comments. \n\nSome information on my daily life:\nMy job is mostly outside, and Im not the best with wearing sunscreen. I would estimate every week I spend about 10-25 hours outside in the sun. Other than that, I am usually inside my house not doing much. The only medication I am currently on is birth control, which I have been on since January 2022. \n\nI also wanted to add a little about my family history, if it could be helpful at all?\nMy grandmother had breast cancer, and a few years ago had something removed that was related to skin cancer (not sure the specifics) \n\nHere are the links for the photos.

From CT state.'","b' Hello. My story of how I ended up in this situation is so long that I could not easily tell it in full with the time I have. But in short, I was put on medications for schizoaffective disorder because I told my school that my sister molested me. My parents instantly jumped to the conclusion that I had to have been delusional for thinking that my sister could\'ve ever done something like that, and told my psychiatrist to put me on meds for schizoaffective/schizophrenia disorder. He committed heavy malpractice and for the longest time didn\'t even tell me what I was diagnosed with, didn\'t even tell me the side effects of the medication, or the name of it.\n\nLong story short, three years later I am on new medications. I was involuntarily sent to a psych ward for trying to file a police report. It was living hell, where no one listened to me or cared for me, and the doctor told me I would be out of there sooner if I started taking injected palipiderone. Then he told me that my stay would be extended. The people in the ward told me that I was delusional and refused to even look at the evidence I had on my phone of my sister literally admitting to a lot of it. I was actually supposed to see a lawyer the day after I was hospitalized. Then he told me that no time would\'ve changed regardless of what meds I took. I heard a lot of stories from other people in the ward about how he did things similar to this and always acted erratic like that. The new meds are horrible, and my new doctor likely will not listen to me if I tell him to take them off. I cannot tell my parents to change the doctor, they are extremely neglectful and will not listen to me. Their only instinct is ""listen to the doctor"" but he never listens to me or believes what I have to say.\n\nI am just wondering if I can just not give my consent to see this doctor without being threatened reasonably by hospitalization, and more importantly can I ask that he taper me off of them?

For a bit of background, I am a 27 year old male, around 5\'9"" and 145lbs, who lives in the southern US. Not super active due to work, but my kids keep me busy. I have always had some issues with back pain, hands that fall asleep at night, along with a history of Lyme disease which kicked off inflammation issues in my teens (food sensitivities, stomach issues, constant feeling of dehydration, lips feel swollen internally but are not, etc, brain fog) - so it may or may not be relevant.\n\nOver the past year and a half, I have been having a good bit of random inflammation issues mainly related to my skin. Additionally I have struggled to feel hydrated and have noticed that small wounds will take months to heal and then stay red in perpetuity. Frankly I have felt dehydrated for years despite constantly drinking water. I admit that I had been drinking alcohol more heavily than I wish for the past 6 years (moderately w/ occasional binge), so my initial concern was due to that. I went to my primary care and/or urgent care a few times due to a few unknown rashes, red marks that won\'t heal, random atopic dermatitis and genital itchiness that went undiagnosed. I received blood panels, glucose checks, STD checks, thyroid checks, and other than slightly elevated cholesterol I appeared to be fine.\n\nI was recommended to urology and dermatology for the various skin issues, and was ultimately treated for light eczema. To be fair, the majority of itchy patches has gone away through topical treatments (except for Red Scrotum Syndrome - which is thought to potentially be a spinal nerve related issue). I never truly felt like I got to the bottom of the issue.\n\nFlash forward to 6 months ago, my new psychiatrist/ psychologist team officially diagnosed me with ADHD and after a few trial and errors I ended up on Vyvanse - I have never felt more mentally sound than now and had a great few months following. My drinking has almost disappeared and I never consume on a day that I take my meds. \n\nFlash forward to 8 or so weeks ago and my hands and feet have been very red/puffy/tight/dry most of the time, very blue on others, and quite cold most of the time (especially when jumping out of the shower or changing temperature quickly). I told my prescriber and we decided that it was likely Raynaud\'s caused or brought out by the medication due to vasoconstriction - should be harmless as long as it is not overly uncomfortable. I started going light on my medication and only took it maybe 4 days of the week mainly for work. I also began taking b multivitamins, fish oil, niacin, and magnesium as I heard that they could potentially help.\n\nFlash forward to 4 weeks ago, both arms suddenly started to feel like they have carpal tunnel. My shoulders/elbows both feel pinchy and my hands feel weirdly tight, dry, cold, and tingly. They have a dull ache that sometimes feels sharp in my palm or fingers, with that cool tingly numbness feeling always lingerning - but always in different places. My knees, shins, and feet also feel and look that same way. \n\n4 weeks ago I stopped taking all medications/alcohol to cut out variables but am still dealing with most of it. The tingling feelings have somewhat gone away, but my hands and feet still feel either hot or cold and tight. A warm coffee cup is all of a sudden very painfully hot to touch, and my fingers feel stiff. My elbows, knees, lips, and scrotum all are red, itchy, and feel swollen.\n\nAt this point I was thinking this is some systemic neuropathy caused by alcohol/other and perhaps potentiated by the Vyvanse due to vasoconstriction. This resparked health anxieties so I went to urgent care. The doctor\'s initial thoughts were due to excess drinking. The blood tests (below) showed my liver and kidney function to be fine...same as last year\'s multiple tests. Also showed my glucose levels to be normal (below) - does this rule out diabetes? They also showed that I am very dehydrated (high hematocrit) which he wrote off - this concerns me however because I drink at least 80oz of water on a normal 24/hr cycle. He recommended me to a neurologist who I won\'t be able to see until August. He also recommended a visit to the rheumatologist even though my ANA factor came back negative - because RA runs in my family. I won\'t see them until next month. \n\nAfter the unfruitful testing and thousands spent last year I am also hesitant to spend more money on my health - but I have a family to stay healthy for. Any recommendations or thoughts on what this could be or steps to take (besides eating healthy, cutting alcohol, and exercise)?

Have a history of depression from ages 18-21 - no longer in therapy.\n\nAround the first of  **August 2022** I went to bed and found myself hearing a sound alike to when you push ur finger in your ear and hear a higher pitched sound. Additionally I would experience some ear pain & pressure. I've always been sensitive to sounds, especially at night and need quite  to sleep. The sound was primarly in the right ear.\n\nWent to the doctor she said might be due to sinuses being blocked/stuffy nose. Took some meds for blocked sinuses to no avail. Went to ear, nose throat specialist and he said ears look fine (no infection etc...) and that tinnitus can just happen. He also mentioned might be due to stiff muscles around neck and face.\n\nSleeping had been okay since I could just sleep on my left ear and not hear anything. Christmas time it was almost unnoticeable to the point where I don't recall being worried or impacted by it. This lasted up until mid January when I would sometimes hear it in my left ear as well. Beginning of Feb it got worse and I would hear the sound in a very high pitched - this lasted 1.5 weeks and it  was bad. Bad sleep quality & headaches. I've been focusing on relaxing my muscles with cream, massage appointments and baths. Interestingly when I took a hot bath with muscles oils I saw major temporary improvement. That night  I slept very well and barely heard the noise at all. The noise returned however less intense as before. To note massagists have always noted that my muscles are very tense - also stems from depression background.\n\nAnother point I want to note is that the noise is sometimes gone and comes back, for example it feels worse at night or later in the day and when I wake up its either very weak or gone in both ears. Curently it is barebly - only hear it when I really focus on it, wear headphones without music or try and sleep on one ear.\n\nMy doctors and family friends who are medical professionals have told me Tinnitus is very difficult to tackle as it can stem from a multitude of reasons. I am just looking for any other opinions or maybe tips I could try to stem or even relieve myself of this noise forever. This has taken quite the toll on my mental health as I have taken care of my ears - barely party, wear earplugs and do not quite accept that this is now chronic and I have to live with it from now on.\n\nThank you for your help & time."""

Sometimes I get extreme itches between my fingers and toes which is the worst. But, over the two weeks, there has been no sign of rashes.  \nEven when I'm in a cold room, the itches can start when I'm sitting and parts of my body do not get enough airflow, like my back when I am leaning on the chair. It also increases at night even when I'm not feeling warm, particularly on the sides that I lay down on the mattress. I've been unable to sleep due to this.  \nI've tried taking fexofenadine 180mg and cetrizine 10 mg, but does not seem to work I've tried external analgesic lotion such as Sarna, which gives me relief for a few hours, enough to get me to sleep. However, I do wake up in a few hours and feel the itches back again.  \nYesterday, I noticed these round red spots with something black in the middle.

I switched deodorants/detergents several times with no results.

So, I thought the rash was possibly a yeast infection that grew worse when I was eating poorly (sugar/carbs).\n\nBut then in January, I was doing a fairly strict low carb/keto-ish diet and saw no change. So, then I thought it was maybe something specific I was eating and I did elimination diets to test the following: dairy, gluten, tree nuts, onions. No change in the rash. Each elimination was for one week. While this isn\'t a long time, I recall in the past when the rash has cleared up, it\'s happened pretty fast.\n\nThis week, I threw the diet out the window and was eating pretty bad (lots of pizza/bread/Cheerios) and I do feel like it flared up and got pretty itchy. \n\nSo is there something else that I\'m consuming that could be causing this that wouldn\'t be impacted by  a gluten elimination diet??

I had an IUD in 2018-2021, but before then and also after I didnt have any except one excruciatingly heavy one a few months after IUD removal. \n\nAnyways, I also have a lot of other health issues going on. I have a chronic rash on my legs and stomach no one can figure out, even after a biopsy in 2 locations. I have tried every steroid cream, prednisone, and more recently an injection called Kenalog and that did nothing. The prednisone helps a LOT, but it always comes back. \n\nI read kenalog can affect periods, so when I started heavily bleeding all of a sudden, I figured it was a normal reaction to me not having a period for so long and that weird affect. After 3 weeks, and increasingly large blood clots, I called 2 doctors. They both told me to go to the ER. Im very glad I went.\n\n\nThey did an ultrasound which showed my ovarian cyst and thicken endometrial lining. It shouldnt be as thick as it was at 8.2-8.5mm after bleeding so long, is what they told me. \n\nMy white blood cell count is 18k\nMy RBC and differentials are low\nPlatelets are 515\nAnd theres more too\nI also saw rare Polychromasia and blood stippling present\n\nIs this all explainable by anemia? I was also on amoxicillin for my jaw surgery. Th swelling was mostly gone by the time this happened, it was a very unpleasant surgery but not as bad as some jaw surgeries because the tumor was so front and center. I was awake and they only used local anesthesia. \n\nAnyways, I found out after downloading the app for the hospital and seeing my blood work, my blood levels are all over the place. They said to see an OBGYN asap, and I have an appointment next week. \n\nMy question is: how likely is this cancer?\n\nI also have had a jaw bone tumor removed and biopsied that I will be finding out the results of tomorrow, and I am scared it is advanced and metastatic due to the fact that it seems megace / megestrol is used for advanced endometrial cancer according to doctor google :P\n\nBut for real, Id like to be somewhat emotionally prepared, some for myself, but mostly for telling other people. \n\nI really do believe in my gut that it is. My mother had atypical precancerous cells in her uterus by 45, and I have PCOS and a high family his for cancer unfortunately. Plus, my SED rate (50mm/hr) & C Reactive Protein (17.5)  was quite high recently. On top of all of that, I have such severe issues with pain and fatigue right now that I cant even do my laundry properly or grocery shop without getting very dizzy.

In both instances I took antacids (Gasofast to be specific) and the symptoms were alleviated. Didn't think much of it. Had an early dinner of Pizza and the next day woke up with severe, sharp stomach pain (which was mostly an inch or so below my sternum) which persisted even when I ate food (which I switched to mostly fruits) and pain went away with fasting. I had ulcer when I was 17, the stomach pain kinda felt similar, hence I went to a gastroenterologist. When I had ulcer the last time, I didn't take any medications just changed my diet for 1 and half month, then I was fine and back to normal.\n\n Since I had food, endoscopy (with biopsy) couldn't be performed until Wednesday (30th Nov, 2021). I did get my blood test done and had elevated CPK (in high 20s range) and rest of the things were normal/within borderline. Due to location of pain, I was also asked to do USG, which said everything was normal. Another blood test (amylase test) was requested which also turned out normal. \n\nOn Saturday (4th Dec, 2021), just as the OPD was done for the day I received my biopsy, which was positive for bacteria indicative of H. Pylori. As I had this issue last time, I moved in with my parents so I could maintain my diet (currently I'm working and living with flatmates, cooking for myself was too challenging in my state at that time). I consulted a doctor back at home who prescribed Sompraz HP kit. \n\nOn the 10th day, I got rashes which were itchy and presented as spots of red dots under my skin. I stopped my medication (except the PPIs) to see if the rashes would go away, but they didn't. The doctor told me to take allegra and citrazine (afternoon and night respectively) then put me on the following -  Levofloxacin 250mg (afternoon), doxycycline 100mg (afternoon) and metronidazole 500 mg (morning and night) while continuing my PPI medication (Sompraz).\n\nWith Sompraz HP kit, it took until 7 days to see noticeable improvement (I had nausea and slightly liquid stools during the medication). Now I'm on my 13th day of treatment with just one day left to go, and the doctor has told me to stop all medications after the 14th day and just observe for any symptoms.\n\nNow, my pain has mostly gone and I can feel hungry without being in pain. However, my allergies have not improved. The doctor told it might take up to a week for my body to clear out the drugs after which I won't have allergies. \n\nIf they don't is there anything else I can do? I would really like to stop the allergy medicines as they put me to sleep (which doesn't feel refreshing) and with slight amounts of brain fog."""

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/11xucd8/left_foot_has_worsening_purple_toes_initially_had/,"b'Left foot has worsening purple toes, initially had bright red inflammation 2-3 months ago'","b'Picture below. I\'ve had this issue for a few months now. I saw a doctor ~2 months ago and the issue has worsened in ways (left foot much more purple) and better in others (right foot not dealing with much discoloration if any)- they provided a few things it could be (reynauds, chillblains, diabetes, and some others i forgot) but I need testing to find out what it actually is. I cannot afford to spend really anything near what these tests cost but may be able to do whichever test seems most probable or indicative soon. My marketplace insurance doesn\'t cover blood testing until i meet a copay i dont have a chance of meeting. I will provide as much information as I can and let me know any questions I missed. The primary issue is my left foot having, what appears to be, very low blood flow in particular but my other foot/fingers are a bit colder than usual. Right foot has been paleish/purpleish especially when I saw the doctor 2 months ago but never as bad as the left included in pictures.\n\nParticularly the left foot has had the worst part of the issue for the 3~ months it\'s been ongoing. At this point, all of the toes are generally a little purple and there have been times they don\'t blanch at all.  My right foot sometimes seems inverse of this, but very rarely / not sure if it has happened since 2 months ago is also a little purple on the right side / right pinky toe. Currently the right foot is generally white and looks fine but still cold at the toes. I just put my feet under some warm water and the left foot gets red but the right almost turns whiter, brighter not pale.\n\nThe issue did seem worse around the time I saw the doctor, with my fingers having more profound coldness and issues with purple/paleness on the right foot. But my left foot didn\'t have nearly as many/much purple toes. Initially my left foot, 1st toe to the left of the big toe, would get sort of inflamed. Appears like fluid retention from my general research, gets red and a little itchy / sensitive , not super swollen but possibly swells a little? Looks like ""covid toes"" that I had seen. I still get this on my fingers randomly which dissipates quickly, where some fingers are red around the nail and it\'s a little more sensitive. I feel like this occurs a lot when I leave my apartment, now that I think about it. I have not had much pain aside from the early red toes/current occasional red fingers which is still pretty minor pain. No pain on the feet or anywhere else really, aside from the hemorrhoid(s) i had/have. If I excerise or run it under warm water it does blanch a little, but if I try it when I\'m at my desk sometimes it doesn\'t blanch at all. I haven\'t really lost feeling anywhere on my body, it doesn\'t usually get numb but every now and then. Doctors did check blood flow to my foot, seemed fine. I visited urgent care for a hemorrhoid and asked them to take a look as well, and they checked the flow to my foot which appeared fine and didn\'t deem the issue urgent to take any further steps. Color is restored pretty quickly upon excerise, warm water, or raising my feet. My foot looks practically normal if I just do any of those things, but gets back to purple/pale quickly if I sit. Unsure about Reynauds as a cause because my limited understanding of Reynauds is that it isn\'t constant like this, more so a reaction. My feet have never really been itchy, only a little when they were initially inflamed. Again, I have not really had much pain anywhere at all which a lot of causes seem to have. \n\nMy background: I believe my blood mother had blood pressure issues but it\'s unclear. I have psoriasis, I have never been tested for diabetes, I have anxiety/depression, started ADHD medication (adderall) ~4 months ago so around a month before this issue arose - no prior ADHD diagnosis in my family. Wheneve i don\'t take it or do take it, doesnt seem to have an impact but I am going to try skipping it both of my weekend days instead of the usual one and see if there are any changes. I have always had issues with dexterity and feel out of breath quickly, have seen 205 bpm or so on a smart watch when going for a run (smart watch, so who knows). I was obese at that time around 210 I believe. My peak weight was 225 during 2022, but since lost weight and now around 175. Issue probably began when I was around 190. I went from 200 to 175 over a span of 4-5 months I\'d say. All weight measurements in pounds. I work from home and don\'t know anybody here so leave very rarely, have had a pretty sedentary lifestyle for the last 2 or 3 years hence the weight gain. I did run a little when I got here but rarely leave for a run now. I do tend to sit poorly at my desk, with my legs crossed or one up but have been sitting properly the last week or so. I have been sleeping with my feet elevated. My diet is poor as I don\'t have a lot of spare money and struggle with most foods. I don\'t eat any meat right now, have usually eaten a lot of chicken in the past. Could have a minor lactose issue, but not diagnosed as the first time I\'ve seen a primary care doctor was at that visit in Jan. Blood pressure checks appear fine everytime I\'ve been tested. My resting rate is usually 78-85. I\'m a 22 years old 5\'9 ~175lb white male. I did use thc a while back 5 months+ but haven\'t since, never smoked or used tobacco, and don\'t drink. I was taking doxylamine succinate for the past few years but have recently stopped. Only known allergies are from a ""severe drug eruption"" due to Trazodone and recently another skin rash reaction to Quetiapine. Taking mirtazpine since 2 weeks ago, taking fish oil supplemements since a week ago. Have purchased some other supplements (Niacin, B12, Magnesium, Iron, L-argynine). The day after I took Niacin and L-argynine my heart felt weird, believe it was palpitations so haven\'t taken again. \n\nI know this is a lot of information, and it may be an obvious (you need to be active or eat better) to fix the issue. I\'m hoping to confirm that, or if it is something someone has seen before. I really struggle with excerise mainly due to insecurities and how tired it makes me, but have been doing jumping jacks on breaks and such to get my heart moving. It\'s difficult to go for a run when it absolutely exhausts me, went outside for 12 ish minutes total a few days ago and ran as much as I could which was not continous or for a very long period; at most I ran for 20-30s at a time and run out of breath. I had to chill for ~1hr30 afterwards before i could get up and try to play a game. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions or any suggestions, thank you. Photo below.\n\ntldr; unsure of cause of left foot having very purple feet from initially red/inflamed feet; and have limited resources for blood tests to figure it out for sure.

I do smoke weed often. \n\nSymptoms (started in November) fatigue, swollen nodes, easy bruising, drenching night sweats, recurring rash, itching, decreased appetite. I started taking pole classes in March and have lost 20lbs since then (I was already fit and Im sure its just from toning but Ive never had my weight change that much so Im not sure if thats normal)\n\nI originally went to the doctor in December for fatigue, itching/rash, easy bruising, night sweats, and a swollen lymph node in my neck that had been there for 2 months at that point. My doctor ran tests and determined the cause of my symptoms to be mono. I also had RSV at the end of December. My tests came back normal except my EBV IgM was positive. \n\nThe MRI in December showed several prominent bilateral cervical nodes with the largest being 1.5cm (which I know isnt large). These are assumed to be reactive due to the mono.  \n\nIve still been experiencing these symptoms and noticed I had some nodes in my groin, that werent hurting but definitely noticeable, and returned to the doctor last week. He ordered tests and referred me to a hematologist. All of my tests came back normal except my C4 complement is decimal points low (the doctor reassured me this is fine). However my EBV this time came back positive for IgM and IgG. \n\nThe hematologist told me that these symptoms are still explained by the mono. \n\nI think Im just confused because I thought mono wasnt something that went on for this long so Im asking here to see how common that is. I just feel like my doctor didnt listen to my symptoms. He wrote in my chart that I am anorexic because of my weight loss and decreased appetite, and he didnt really discuss any of the bruising or other symptoms, just the lymph node and fatigue. \n\nI guess I just want to know if I need a second opinion or if this is just normal mono stuff. \n\nIve included photos of the bruising on my legs, my rash, and the bruising that occurred when I had pink eye in October here and I am happy to answer questions. \n\n[photos](https://imgur.com/a/f2RxGlp)'"

He's supposed to get his wisdom tooth removed next month. After a day, he felt pain in the far back of his teeth. He was given a night guard because his gums at the back were inflamed. I think he had clenched his teeth under stress. Now, he has small blisters on his lower lip and around the chin area. These rashes are only present on his face, and not the rest of his body. I was wondering if it was normal for rashes to not be itchy but only painful when touched.  He is also feeling pain around his head from time to time; the pain occurs in different areas of his head at random. Moreover, he is also feeling severe sharp neck pain that occurs without warning. He was prescribed with anti-viral medicine but I wanna know how else I can help him with the pain? Is there any particular foods he should be eating to get better? Thank you in advance!"""

(the wound is on the inside of my elbow) There is also minor red swelling around the wound but i suspect that it is from the tightness of the adhesive on the wound dressings. I just got done with a shower and peeled the dressing and there seems to be white stuff in the wound itself. What should I do? Is it healing? Is the regular antiseptic drying the wound out?

November 22 I developed an itchy rash on the back of my neck which soon spread to my shoulders, back and eventually my face/ears/scalp. I work in TRAUMA/ER and the only thing I could think of was a recent exposure to a homeless woman that we believed to have scabies and some sort of visible lice or bugs all over her. Unfortunately, she did not survive so follow up at the onset of my symptoms was not available. I was treated for scabies with permethrin x 3 as well as lice shampoo. Symptoms temporarily subsided and then returned in the same spots and other places. 20 years in the hospital and prehospital setting I had never experienced anyhting of this nature, I was so freaked out that I bought a new bed,new bedding, rugs and drapes. I steamed and deconned other furniture, had air ducts cleaned,bombed my house and car multiple times, washed and bagged every item possible, you name it ....I did it, did a second round of topical permethrin x 2, sulfa baths etc. Things mellowed out leaving areas that resembled mosquito like bites with dark spots in the middle that would come back after a week or so plus new ones. I went to derm and they acted like I was crazy, standing so far away from me I don\'t know how she was able to evaluate eventually telling me contact dermatitis. Offering triamcinalone, keflex and benedryl. I started crying and she eventually said ""fine, Ill give you ivermectin and that will be like an atomic bomb!"" She prescribed one time dose and sent me on my way, they never discussed or called me for follow up lol. After ivermectin things got worse, flaking and bareley improving. I was done with derm and employee health at this point. My PMD did telemed apt and told me to stop steroid, start doxy, permethrin again and 6 more doses of ivermectin. I had about 3 weeks of minor improvement. I had them everywhere at this point in different stages mostly dark outer areas with small dots in the middle or new spots. I am currently off meds for 2 weeks and still having new eruptions. I have been researching everything and am thinking this may be fungalall along as the patient very well could have had ring worm or something of that nature. I am not immunocomprimised, do not drink etoh or use drugs, no medical hx alleric to cipro and take lexapro and doxy now. The photos I have found are very similar to what I thought was scabies or post scabies. Thoughts?'"

About a year ago, when the pandemic ended and I went back to in-person school, I noticed severe cognitive deficits. Mainly in focus, attention, and thinking speed. My parents didnt believe what I was describing was a real problem, and after months of fighting, I convinced them to make an appointment with my psychiatrist. He said that it seemed I might have ADHD, and prescribed a very LOW dose stimulant. Upon taking it for a few days/weeks, I noticed not only an improvement in my cognitive issues, but also in my ocd and general quality of life, which has been rather poor for the last few years. \n\nMy parents were not happy with the medication from the biggin. They started out arguing it was bad because of how much weight I lost (a few kilos), however, I described that the weight loss was getting better, and was likely due to something else (which I will describe in a bit). However, these rational arguments against the medication quickly evolved into full-blow made up paranoia. They began straight up making upside effects, from insomnia (which I didnt have), and my hands being shacky (which is a problem Ive alyise had, and is a result of the biology of OCD). Yet their biggest paranoid concern was becoming an addict. They on multiple occasions said I would become a heroin, meth cocain, etc addict. This constant fighting led to them refusing to ask my doctor to raise the dose when I described I thought we should. Because of this, I raised the dose on my own, which only helped reinforce their drug addict delusions. I also went for a neuro psych test, a multi hour diagnostic test, which although confirmed a lot of the issues I described having, stated I likely didnt have clinical ADHD. Regardless, the next appointment I had with my doctor, we (me and hime, as my parents were opposed to it decided to continue giving it a try because of the benefit I stated, however, we didnt increase the dose.\n At the beginning of the summer, I went to a residential treatment facility(which was planned science the cognitive issue started, but was delayed until the summer). Despite the OCD not really having much of an effect on me, I agreed to go because I hoped they would be willing to be more aggressive with the medication, however not only did they not increase the dose, but they took me off the Adderall. I was there for a total of 5 weeks, which was pure hell. THey took me off it with about 2 weeks left, due to the fact I didnt have clinical adhd, and needless to say my misserly over there increased exponentially. When I got home and had a meeting with my own doctor, he said to keep me off it, and to have a nother meating after 2 months, to see how school goes.\n\n It is now the day before that appointment, and I have been living in absolut misery for more than 3-4 months. All the symptoms improved got worse again, and I am in a deep state of misery. My only real hope now is to get put back on the medication tomorrow, however my parents refuse to even discuss this, and end up just yelling at me, calling me an addict. I need your help with ideas on how to try getting back on the medication. What can I do or say to try convincing my doctor that I was actually helped massively by it, and have gotten much worse after getting off it, as opposed to my parents constantly saying im just doing this to get drugs. Im honestly not sure what I can do if my doctor also refuses to put me back on, or if my parents simply refuse to pick up the prescription. Any help would be really helpful.\n\nFyi the appointment is online, where Im with my parents on a couch with the doctor in a zoom call'"

Was taken care of. No other medical conditions at all, very healthy.

Another one followed behind the ear and I believe another one up into the hair line. All large, all painful. I will include photos in the comments. \n\nIts important to note that she is a woman who absolutely never complains about anything, I would be surprised if she went to the hospital even if she was missing a limb she is very calm and seems to have a high sickness and pain tolerance. I could also count on maybe 2 fingers the amount of times she has called into work. \n\nShe woke up in the middle of the night last night crying in pain, said it was unbearable like she has been hit with a baseball bat in the head. So she went to the ER and called into work. They didnt do much more than glance at her and diagnose it as cellulitis. No blood work, no ear/throat exam (Idk if thats relevant). Gave her a norco and sent her home with an antibiotic RX (but no shot). \n\n\nShe now has a rash that is spreading down her neck, is saying the pain is still a 10/10 (I believe this) and none of the medication (IB 800) is helping at all.

Sometimes I get these uncontrollable itches all over my skin, I feel crazy and tense, and itching it doesnt help at all. Its the most intense on my legs, but it happens all over my body. I also feel like my mind doesnt get any rest when this happens. \n\nWeirdly, my skin also gets a little bumpy, the way it is when youre shivering from cold. Its absolutely not a rash, and not eczema, because theres nothing that visibly changes except the chicken skin. Its also not the kind of itching you get when youre dry. Its a deeper kind of itch, like its under the surface almost, like its something going on within my body, or in my brain, for that matter. Its just this really uncomfortable, along with the itching and mental tension and fatigue because it never ends.\n\nSometimes the remedy is heat, sometimes its cold. It varies. Writing this Im covering my bare legs in my chilly bed cover, for example. Thinking of getting a cold shower. Sometimes the only thing that works is putting a hot blanket over me, or taking a hot shower. It varies.\n\nIt actually feels like the skin isnt itching from dryness (or any external factors for that matter) because mositurising my skin doesnt help. For example, today it would only become worse with a moisturiser since it contains oils and humectants which would make my skin feel hotter, and thats the exact opposite of what I need today.\n\nAlso, when the itch goes on for a while, I become tired. And especially after Ive treated the itch with heat or cold, and the itch is mostly gone, I become super sleepy. If I take a nap at that point, then when I wake up I feel a sense of great relief and soothing relaxation, the way you would when youve been nervous or anxious do something, and then its finally over and you did great. Im not energised really, only very relieved and a little exhausted.\n\nI know - super weird. \n\nSo no, its not lack of moisture I think. Its rather as if the receptors in my skin are triggered for some weird reason. Not even sure the stimuli is external actually.\n\nDoes anyone know what this is?\n\nMy demographics:\nGender: Female\nMedication: Citalopram (SSRI) and Propavan (propiomazin, for sleep)\nAge: 30\nSmoking: No\nDuration of itch: About 10-15 years, happens sporadically. Stays for hours when it happens.\nLocation of itch: Mostly legs!

She was prescribed Taro-Mupirocin (~two weeks ago) which has been consistently been applied to the wounds. I added pictures of the ones on her back as she cant reach those! Will try to get clearer pictures/videos. She doesnt have the steadiest hands, which is exacerbated by lithium and how freaked out she is.

She is a clean human. I did not think that this would be a hat stall over her hygiene. \n\nWarning: Above link has pictures of skin lesions, wounds, and unknown specimens. \n\nMy gf (29F) has been increasingly sick for about a year. She has had fevers, vomiting, bruising, and disorientation, balance and vision issues. These episodes seemed to worsen on February 14 2023, and again half way through March (which hasnt let up). Additionally, she has skin lesions that began appearing months ago. The skin lesions start out looking like Fig. 3 and open up into teardrop shaped sores (Fig. 5), before darkening into black scabs. I have posted photos from the multiple stages, see attachments 3-8. \n\nHowever; a few weeks ago she began seeing white worms emerging from the wounds, and more alarmingly moving in her eyes (see Fig. 9 and 10). After weeks of seeing these worms we Finally got it on video (Fig. 1 and 2). If you would please take a look at even the first two and tell us any of your thoughts on what these are it would be immensely helpful. My gf is brilliant and she has the biggest heart - Id do anything to figure this out and give her life back \n\nMedical info: She has been swapped for MRSA and her GP is consulting with a dermatologist. Shes had surgery for a fistula in the past. She is Canadian, but she has traveled to many places including: Senegal, Brazil, and all over the Caribbean. \n\nOther background: Weve tried everything to get medical help, but as she has Bipolar Disorder going to the ER has resulted in the assumption that she is on drugs and that its all in her head. I have been with her every day as she gets sicker and sicker. She is not a drug user, and shes not crazy. Her symptoms are very real and she is terrified. I am struggling getting her to continue reaching out for help as she feels so defeated by the continued failure of the system. I dont know where to go next. Please help us, thank you in advance for your time.

Image in comments.\n\nBaby has a flaky and red circular rash that is increasing in diameter steadily. It is on the back of her right shoulder. It has been there for about three months. It is in the boundary of a large port wine stain birthmark shes had since birth (thats the surrounding redness). Shes seen two pediatricians for it. The first recommended hydrocortisone (2.5%), we applied 2x a day with aquaphor over it for over a month and it did not seem to help. Second ped recommended an OTC antifungal cream with a barrier like aquaphor and it seems to have made it worse. We have been using that 2x a day for about a week. I contacted her doctor via mychart yesterday and a nurse responded to keep using the antifungal cream for a month. My gut is that the antifungal is making it worse or is ineffective. Id love another opinion here. Its about the size of a nickel now and was dime sized and less red.'"

Sugar water test done in August 2022.\n\nRace: White\n\nDrink: casually, not much at all.\n\nSmoke: No. And no drug use either.\n\nPrimary complaint:\n\nHas had on and off constant irritation and itching in SPECIFICALLY the bottom right part of my vagina and vulva (Inside and a little out). This has been on and off since taking antibiotics in august 2022 and after intercourse in September 2022. Was treated for yeast infection, all symptoms EXCEPT itching went away. Continued to be treated for yeast infection with a multitude of other symptoms for months including lidocaine for the itching. No one could figure out what it was. I was tested for yeast, vaginosis, UTI and other typical infections for women. None of these worked.\n\nI went in for my yearly in December at my old OBGYN and talked to her about my issues. After examination, she noted my hymen was white. I have some family members with auto immune so she thought possibly lichen sclerosis. She gave me a steroid. The steroid actually worked and made me feel better. A week later I go back for my check up and she says it is no longer white so it is likely not lichen sclerosis. She instructs me to stop the steroid and that she thinks it\'s Vulvodynia. She puts me on the following MIXTURE (yes mixture, I had to go to a special pharmacy) of the following medications in ointment form:\n\nBupivacaine, flurbiprofen, Gabapentin, Lidocaine 2-10-10-5% Lipoderm. Instructions, apply a pea sized amount to area 3-4 times a day.\n\nMy OBGYN retired in December and so I went to my new one last week. Over the past 3 weeks of January, my itching symptoms have increased exponentially since first trying this new medication. I was told by old OBGYN, OBGYN Nurse, and by pharmacist that it WILL burn a little when I put it on. However, now the frequency of needing to use the medication has gone from once a day to 6 times a day and even during the night at 3-5am. I can\'t go longer without it. The medication will get rid of the itch and ease my paint fo ra while but it comes back like an angry horney. Yesterday, I woke up with an ANGRY pain in my vulva/labia. It hurt to touch, to go to the bathroom. Yet, i can\'t stop the medication or I have NO relief.\n\nI tried to call my doctor but all of the nurses have just thrown \'we can see you tomorrow\' or dismissed me just to get me off the phone. Interrupted me every time I tried to explain what happened. I already saw my new OBGYN and told her what happened. All she did was take my blood and do swab samples to test for vaginosis. She did not prescribe me ANYTHING for the relief. I don\'t know what to do. I\'m almost out of this new medication. I tried to call the new doctor to ask if I should go back on the steroid and the nurse just (very irresponsibly in my opinion without asking for any information and interrupting me so I can\'t give it to her) \'stop using the medication that is making it worse and just use the steroid\'. Meanwhile, I am trying to figure out if that is okay with increased symptoms, etc etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt costs me $80 per appointment and I can\'t just take time off that quickly like that.\n\nShould I go back to using this Steroid? Is there some kind of... super obgyn specialist that deals in weird random itching of female genitalia?\n\nI\'ve had MANY doctors including both of my OBGYNS do visual exams of my genitalia. They do not see any bumps, lumps, nothing. Just redness. There\'s no visual indicators of what the heck it could be. And I am so TIRED and frustrated. I just want relief from this irritation and pain. I just want help. I don\'t understand why it\'s so hard to listen to what I\'m saying is wrong with me. I don\'t know what to do. I don\'t really know where to go at this point. I need advice. It doesn\'t sound or look like this is a typical medical case. I don\'t know. I\'m not a doctor but it\'s been months and no one has been able to figure out what is wrong with me and what is causing the issue. I haven\'t had rough sex. I don\'t like anything rough and basically have been without intercourse for 2-3 months now while all this is going on. Please, if anyone can give me advice here, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate edit: \n\nDay 3. Last night I had a break down because I was woken up by chronic pain and itching. Nothing stopped. I took pain killers. I tried lidocaine. I even went back to the steroid. It helped only a little. I literally had a break down from lack of sleep. I haven\'t had more than 4-5 hours for the past 3-5 days.  I\'m exhausted. I\'m tired of the pain. I just want peace again. \n\nMy doctor called and told me I was negative for all major STDS that she tested for and vaginosis. Not a big surprise to me. I already knew that. She also told me I didn\'t have a yeast infection. No surprise again. Then she goes \'I think you might have Vulvadynia\' and then proceeds to explain what that is. Which honestly makes me feel so freaking ignored. I went into her office last week and told her my retired/previous OBGYN thought it was Vulvadynia too and the med she prescribed me made it worse. \n\nMy current OBGYN didn\'t even acknowledge that and went on to explain the medication she\'s prescribing me. It\'s a slight sedative they use to treat depression, irritable bowel and vulvadynia pain. It makes you tired and sleepy apparently. So I am hoping this will fix my sleepless night issues. Putting the steroid on last night I think helped. It wasn\'t immediate pain, but today the irritation is back to being minimal again. So I think the Steroid DOES help, it\'s just not fast acting and immediate like I want. I also have been taking anti-inflammatory ibprofen. I HATE taking that because I read a study saying IBPROFEN can cause chronic pain later in life. But I gotta do what I gotta do for relief. \n\nAt this point, I am basically recording this for any other women who are experiencing these insane symptoms like me might try to work with their doctors on figuring it out sooner. I know that women\'s health has largely been overlooked and understudied. We didn\'t even figure out the clitoral complex existed until \'discovered\' in 2005 by  Helen OConnell.\n\nI\'m hopeful. I think relief might be in sight. We\'ll see. I\'ll update if the medication does work and I\'ll post what it is once I get the prescription from the doctor. \n\n&#x200B;'"

I also noticed round red areas around 3 locations, two on my left arm and one on my right arm, in areas where I had recently had a scratch/irritation.\n\nI want to try and understand the nature of the rash, given the following information: I had been sitting in the sun for about 1 hour after taking the medication, and I felt an overstimulated and uneasy feeling, so I laid down.  The feeling did not pass the way I wanted it to, so to try and refresh my mind I decided to take a shower.  I felt a very weird distant almost dissociating feeling while in the shower and tried to use meditation techniques to calm what I imagined was an increase in anxiety.  Eventually I finished showering, including using a face wash product that has caused similar irritation to my skin in that exact upper cheek area in the past.  I finished up with the shower on cold which made an immense improvement in how I felt, and I got out of the shower and looked in the mirror to see the rash I described, which was concerning to me.  The rash faded within an hour or so, it was never itchy, never swollen, and was not present ANYWHERE else on my body.  It did not go up my neck, it was sort of behind my ears though.  My skin felt a little dryer than normal afterwards.\n\n**SUMMARY:**\n\n5mg dextroamphetamine\n\n1 hour sun exposure\n\nHot shower to cold shower\n\nExposure to known irritant\n\nRASH: Non symmetrical on part of upper chest, symm. on upper cheeks, symm. on upper neck behind ears, 3 spot rashes, seemingly like wheals, <1 inch diameter\n\nNoticed after 2 hours, gradually for about 1 hour til gone\n\nSkin now drier\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is, how likely was it that I had an allergic reaction to the medication, considering I have taken other forms of the medication in the past (mixed amp salts adderall XR and IR but NOT dextroamphetamine and NOT this manufacturer) but have not noticed a reaction like this?\n\nAdditionally, what is the possibility that this reaction was related to photosensitivity, or a combination of sun exposure (upper chest and arm areas would have had highest exposure) and the wash I used which has irritated sensitive areas of my skin (but never to this extent)?\n\nI can't say I ever had any other symptoms of anaphylaxis, but upon reading of the preceding anxiety/sense of doom/very weird feeling that people have, I'm concerned I may have had an allergic reaction to the medication.  I will certainly not continue to take the medication and seek professional advice, but I would like to hear some theories as to what might have happened.\n\nI mainly would like to know the potential risk of a prolonged or biphasic reaction if indeed this was a systemic allergic reaction, and how likely a situation like this would be given that I did not notice any symptoms for approximately 2 hours, with anxiety subsiding very quickly after the cold shower and the rash fading within an hour.\n\nThanks everyone, if I have any other info I'll try to include it!\n\nEdit: I did not drink or eat anything out of the ordinary, I do not have any known allergies, I do not smoke, I drink alcohol occasionally but haven't had any alcohol since last weekend."""
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13hd1ix/21f_possible_levothyroxine_drug_eruption_rashes/,b'21F possible Levothyroxine drug eruption rashes',"b'Age: 21 \n\nSex: F\n\nHeight: 53\n\nWeight: 115\n\nRace: Caucasian\n\nI work in dermatology (as a medical assistant; I am in my first year of medical school), and I have already had the physician I work with take a look. I have worked in dermatology for several years now, but I wanted to post on here to ask for a second opinion and another perspective.\n\nSome context: on May 2nd, I began treatment with generic Levothyroxine (dosage 25 mcg). I was recently diagnosed with Hashimotos thyroiditis by my endocrinologist. \n\nOn May 8th, I noticed a few small, tiny, raised rashes on my abdomen; no itching whatsoever. Each following day, I noticed more and more of these tiny little rashes. Today is May 14, and these rashes are now distributed all over my abdomen, back, chest, and neck. There are even a few directly above the groin area. I have never had rashes that look like this before, ever.\n\nMy first thought was cholinergic urticaria. I am tachycardic, and I also take Concerta for my ADHD (I have been on a stable dose of this medication for 3 years now), so I sweat easily with heat. (Before you ask, I have seen a cardiologist recently, and my EKG and echo are normal; I have trace mitral regurg, but that is the only slight abnormality). However, I have never had cholinergic urticaria before, and the rashes are more rash-like than hive-like, and they did not go away within 24 hours. At this point I sent myself hydrocortisone 2.5, and began applying it to the affected areas. \n\nThen, I had the thought that these rashes may be caused by bedbugs. I did a complete search of my bed, bedroom, and apartment, and found no sign of bedbugs (or any other bugs for that matter). Just to be safe, I did a deep clean and disinfection of my entire apartment, mattress, bedding, etc. Also, if the rashes were in fact bedbug bites, they would be extremely itchy (which they are not), and the rashes would have a tiny dark blood spot in the centre, which they do not.\n\nAnd then I realized that the sudden appearance of these mystery rashes all over my body may be related to my Levothyroxine (which is generic T4, not any brand name). The sudden appearance of the rashes coincided with when I started taking Levothyroxine, or more accurately when I had been taking it for about a week or so. \n\n(No, I have not had any contact with any pets, new household products, no new shampoos or soaps either, and we have ruled out ACD).\n\nI reached out to my endocrinologist as soon as I came to the realization that these rashes may be a drug eruption. He informed me that I may be having a reaction to the dyes, fillers, and additives in Levothyroxine, and he sent out a prescription for Tirosint that same day. Tirosint does not contain any of the dyes, fillers, or additives that Levothyroxine, Synthroid, etc contain, and it only has a few ingredients as opposed to many. I did some research, and I found that quite a few patients reported reactions and developed rashes as a side effect of Levothyroxine/Synthroid/other T4 medications containing such ingredients. These patients seemed to do better on Tirosint. My endocrinologist also suggested I see one of the dermatologists that I work with about the rash.\n\nI skipped my Levothyroxine dose for two days, and as of yesterday morning, I took my first dose of Tirosint 25 mcg (my insurance refused to cover it, so it took me some time to actually get the prescription).\n\nYesterday (May 13), I had a dermatologist at my practice take a look at the rashes on my body. She found more on my back that I wasnt aware of. She also did not know what the rashes were, and was extremely puzzled, but she did agree with me at the possibility that they may have been caused by a reaction to the generic Levothyroxine I had been taking. However, she isnt sure, and I have reached out to another dermatologist at my practice for her opinion as well.\n\nI have attached three photos of the rashes below. The first is of my abdomen, the second is of my neck (I have coloured over my collarbone tattoo for anonymity), and the third is of my chest (the two pimple-like bumps in the middle of the rashes are benign and I have had them since childhood). Every day I find more and more of these rashes on my body, and since they do not seem to be resolving, I am looking for another opinion as to what they are, what may be the cause of them, and how I should go about treating them. The sudden appearance of these rashes is extremely upsetting and stressful. Summer is here, and I cannot be dealing with mystery rashes all over my body right now; it is devastating.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/S2ObZ3H'"

I developed a fever, diarrhea, and a cough. The fever and the diarrhea went away after a day or two, but the cough remained until last week. \n\nFrom December to February 20, the cough was minor and I rarely thought about it. But then it turned nasty. I caught another bug, with pressure behind my ears, a fever, and a hacking cough that produced a little bit of blood and a lot of phlegm. I struggled for weeks to talk for extended periods of time without coughing and losing my breath. I was wheezing. My strength wasnt particularly affected, but I stopped working out for 10 days in order to recover. \n\nI went to urgent care and was given an inhaler. I then saw my primary care physician and had a CBC and a chest x-ray. My CBC was normal and my doctor says my x-ray was normal, too, even tho I cant seem to locate the file on my patient portal. \n\nAfter I saw my PCP on March 6, I started to develop pain in my chest and itchiness, primarily on my chest, but also on my neck and groin. The pain and the itchiness comes and goes. My chest is tender to the touch, as though Ive been struck by a 100 mph fastball. \n\nFor the past few months, I have felt post-nasal drip. It hasnt been 24/7, but there hasnt been one day where I havent felt it at some point. I thought that all my symptoms stemmed from my cough, yet now my cough has gone away and everything else has stayed the same. \n\nA couple other things I want to mention: On a handful of occasions during the past few months, I have felt something like a lump in my throat and some discomfort on the left side of my throat. Ive regurgitated food on two occasions. My stomach, during this time, has been unusually noisy. I thought maybe acid reflux was at play and took something for that, but that hasnt seemed to help. \n\nIn addition, my dog has cancer and she is taking a medication called Chlorambucil, whose side effects apparently including rashes and itching. My wife gives the dog the pills and handles the pills with gloves. I pick up the dogs poop with a bag over my hand, clean up after her when she pees on the rug, and use a blanket that she sometimes sits on. IDK if I have gotten some of the medication on my skin, causing the itching. \n\nMy appetite is good. My weight is stable. My strength is good. My sleep is good. But this itching and this chest painit wont go away. \n\nI have two tests scheduleda pulmonary functioning test and a CT scan of my chest. \n\nAny idea whats going on? \n\nThank you.'"

Hands and palms. I had crazy itching on my face and hair.

Now they're slightly better but they don't look good. I've had to moisturise them constantly.\n\n5) my skin feels super sensitive to the sun. I live in a hot climate but never had this before. I have to now wear 50+ sunscreen and my itching goes through the roof when I step outside.\n\n6) I've had 2 different lip sores develop at the corners of my mouth.

I don't know if this is a side effect.\n- restarted smoking after a month of having quit. I had been vaping but was concerned at how I was so addicted to the nicotine. So decided to smoke one or two cigs a day as even though worse for lungs etc, the addiction/control wouldn't be so bad as sitting there at my desk the whole time vaping away.\n- smoked hash for the last 2 or 3 weeks but never had any problems before.

Can you help me narrow down what to ask?\n\n* There is a **second lump** in my throat besides a walnut-sized thyroid nodule. It hasnt been examined. What tests should I ask for?\n* I had weird white blood cell test results a few weeks ago. With the swollen area in my throat, does that make it more likely to be:\n   * an infection\n   * autoimmune disorder\n   * or cancer?\n* I have also been having abnormal uterine bleeding again and passed a 3cm+ blood clot yesterday. Would antithyroid medication help with this or should I ask for female hormones?\n\nDetails and more symptoms below.\n\nThank you!\n\n\n\n47F, 54, 123 lbs, Caucasian, lifetime non-drinker/nonsmoker/never drugs/no medications/former multi-sport athlete. I had COVID-19 in March 2020, before the shutdown.\n\nI have been doing the medical mystery tour for over a year. I have a 3.5cm benign autonomous thyroid nodule (TR4 with 6 points)/multinodular goiter, and I also had a benign endometrial polyp, abnormal uterine bleeding, and a precancerous adenoma in my colon all show up between Thanksgiving and February. I also started losing my voice in December, to the point that people cant always hear me when I speak now.\n\nI have been having erratic heartbeat and chest pain and had a borderline abnormal EKG three weeks ago. I assumed this was from hyperthyroidism, TSH .31, but endocrinologist says I am not hyperthyroid. I am often lightheaded and short of breath.\n\nI have also had some anomalous tests, including ketones in my urine and immature granulocytes in my blood. Every time I go to urgent care (three times this year, twice for rectal bleeding and once for erratic heartbeat) they take my BP and immediately put me on an IV.\n\nI also have a hard swollen spot under my jaw that I assumed was a swollen lymph node. Today during surgery consult, the surgeon said it is probably a salivary gland. (That area was not scanned during the thyroid ultrasound even though I pointed it out). It has been swollen and painful for over two months. I thought the constant pain I was having in my throat and up into my jaw was from the thyroid nodule, but could it be an infection of the salivary gland instead? Or maybe an autoimmune issue? Or I got a false negative on the fine needle aspiration? I have all the symptoms of thyroid cancer except for breathing issues.\n\nThe surgeon also used a camera to check my voice box, and she says it looks fine. I wonder if my voice issues are caused by the thyroid nodule pressing on something - or if its a coincidence and something else is going on.\n\nPrior to these findings, I had unintentional weight loss (over 1/4 of my body weight) and months of severe abdominal pain. Had ultrasound, CT scan, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and gastric emptying study. Ruled out ulcers, stomach cancer, gallstones, kidney stones, ulcerative colitis, Crohns, celiac, and gastroparesis. Found mild inflammation in stomach and esophagus. Diagnosis SIBO. Did a course of Cipro and another of Rifaximin, three months of semi-elemental diet, and spent two months reintroducing FODMAPs. I am finally eating normally again and have quit dropping weight - just in time for all this other stuff to show up.\n\nThe other ongoing things are eczema/skin rashes and insomnia. I can usually only sleep 4-5 hours and it feels like Ive drunk a pot of coffee even though I havent had caffeine in a year. Oh, and I started having a limp in my right leg when I stand up, and a new shooting pain in my lower back. (Relatively minor but a layperson never knows what will be relevant to a pathologist).\n\nThe head & neck surgeon says the thyroid nodule doesnt explain any of my other problems and wanted me to know that removing it may not resolve any of my symptoms.\n\nUntil today, I was really hoping that this nodule represented some kind of endocrine disruption and that removing it would spontaneously resolve all my issues, and I could go back to a normal life. Now it seems like maybe it is either a coincidence - welcome to your forties - or there is some deeper root cause and its just one symptom of several. I have worked with five doctors now and none of them seem to have an idea what is going on.\n\nI swear I am not a hypochondriac - all I want is to run an ultramarathon for my 50th birthday.\n\nI have a 10-minute phone appointment with my physician on Monday. Can you help me narrow down what to ask him? He is really good about ordering labs and giving referrals.\n\nThank you very much for reading this incredibly long post.'"

I am located in Minnesota and will absolutely take a recommendation on a professional to see.\n\nOver the past few weeks I have seen 8 or 9 different doctors between the emergency room, my GP, a OBGYN, breast specialist, nurses, a PA and a dermatologist, I even saw a hematologist due to unusual blood work. No one knows what is wrong with me, how to diagnose me or how to treat me. But they all agree something is very wrong. Originally they thought Lupus and then the ER said vasculitis. When I saw my GP on Friday he asked me what I had found on google and started taking notes. Im shit terrified.\n\nLast year when things were bad. but not even close to this bad I was cleaned by endocrinology. This year I was cleared by allergy.

Blood vessels are bursting and I experience swelling and pain with this. \n\n-vulva swelling with distended veins.\n\n-I have problems with spikes in blood pressure and heart rate that cant be explained and I was often told it is anxiety. It comes with a burning feeling in my chest and back. It is usually self limiting to hours and they dont have a known trigger.\n\n-my hands swell and turn red and purple if I get too warm or too upset.\n\n-I dont sweat anymore. Being hot makes me feel very sick and my face turns bright red. My skin feels like it is burning. It takes multiple ice packs and hours in front of an air conditioner to cool down to a regular temperature.\n\n-I get stretches of unexplained chest pains. Sometimes I will feel like inside of my chest itches. Sometimes it will feel hard to breathe.\n\n-I get stretches of unexplainable abdominal pains. Sometimes hours and sometimes weeks. I sometimes feel like the pain is generalized to a specific area like around my spleen or around my stomach. It will hurt worse if I touch the area. Sometimes it is full abdomen pain. During my last upper/lower I was told there was unexplained esophagus inflammation. I have had episodes of delayed gastric emptying with vomiting during these periods.\n\n-I get weird rashes on my arm if I go outside or get too hot.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13ejtn1/rash_on_lips/,b'Rash on lips',"b'32F, I take daily: Doxepin (to help *stay* asleep), Fluoxetine (for mild depression), Pramipexole (for restless leg syndrome), Daysee birth control pill, Unisom (to help *get* to sleep), Naltrexone (for substance abuse, but have been totally clean & sober for 10+ years now). I have been on all of these medications together for several years now, without any issues. I also use a daily probiotic for digestion, and a daily women\'s probiotic for feminine health. I often take Zyrtec D, Delsym cough syrup, and Mucinex for environmental allergies (dust). I also take a women\'s daily gummy vitamin. None of these things are new, and I have been taking them for years previously without any issues.\n\nWhen I was going through puberty (appx age 11-13), I developed a bad red/pink rash around my lips and mouth. It looked like very severe acne, but was only around my mouth (the rest of my face was perfectly clear). My lips were involved too, with them being incredibly dry, chapped, cracked, and peeling, while at the same time oozing yellowish clear pus from tiny pustules (I think pustules is the right word, I can\'t remember exactly)...little tiny bumps filled with fluid. Neither the bumps nor the discharge was white in color, the bumps being the same color as the skin around it (pinkish-red to translucent). The rash seemed to emanate from my lips and spread around my mouth (on my face) from there, particularly in the corners of the mouth, and below it, in my upper chin area. Applying plain chapstick or Vaseline seemed to help with the pain of the extreme dryness, but it\'s as if my lips and rash just soaked it all right up - within a few minutes, it was as if I had never even put any on, and was just as dry (if not more) than before. Both the rash and my lips were bumpy, oozing pus, while also dry and peeling. I remember it being very uncomfortable.\n\nBack then, the doctors initially thought that it was HSV, but then determined that was not actually the case. Dermatologists performed a patch test for allergies on my back (that\'s how I know about the dust), but what created the same reaction was a specific type of metal (I don\'t remember the name of it, but I remember them determining that it wasn\'t in soda cans, or any typical metal object that might be touching my lips). At the time, I had braces and headgear, and the dermatologists determined that it must be in those, and that I was reacting to that (even though they weren\'t new).\n\nBut when we discussed this with my orthodontist, he did some research, and determined (by speaking with the manufacturers) that that specific type of metal was not in any of the materials in my braces or in my headgear. And so, the dermatologists just kind of shrugged their shoulders and sent me on my way. The rash and lips eventually cleared up on its own after a couple of years.\n\nYears later, at age 21, I went to inpatient treatment for opioid abuse. After detoxing, the same rash suddenly began to appear again (although it did not get as severe this time). One of the NP\'s saw it and stated something like ""Oh yeah, that\'s just a skin sensitivity in reaction to whatever products you\'re using on your lips. Only use plain original unscented chapstick or Vaseline on your lips, and that should clear it right up. I see this all the time.""\n\nSo I did, and she was right, that did take care of it. I wasn\'t using anything crazy on my face or lips at the time, but scented/flavored chapstick was a favorite of mine. During the puberty episode, I had been using Burt\'s Bees Lip Balm or Blistex. I had also never used drugs or drank alcohol prior to or during the puberty flair up.\n\nOver the years since then, it would occasionally start to come back mildly, but then I\'d just load it up with Vaseline, which would take care of it before it got any worse. It made sense to me that internal times of stress within my body triggered it (going through puberty, detoxing off of addicting substances, ect). \n\nNow, at age 32, it has come back with a vengeance. It started off with just chapped lips and dry corners of my mouth, that would eventually get a little crusty if I didn\'t wipe it away and reapply the plain chapstick. I thought that was just due to the seasons changing. But then the corners of my mouth started to crack and become painful, and the rash began to appear, emanating from the corners of my lips - out and downward. \n\nSo I started to load on the Vaseline (which would always heal it when it got to this point before, except during the first puberty outbreak). But this time, it has only continued to get worse. It is presenting slightly different this time though, in that the rash has been worse on my lips and not spread out on my face nearly as much. There is also a very bloody-looking ring around the inside of my lips, where my outer lips meet my inner lips (which I don\'t remember happening before), although it is not actually bleeding. But otherwise, the symptoms are the same... My lips are swollen and burning, incredibly dry, chapped, cracked, and peeling, with tiny oozing pustules that just immediately soak up any chapstick I might apply. The same yellowish-clear pus oozes out of them. But some of the bumps are red at this point. My lips feel very tight, swollen, bumpy, wet, and crusty, all at the same time. But I have zero trouble breathing.\n\nI feel certain that this is more than simply severe chapped lips, due to the rash, bumps, pus, and history with similar outbreaks. But I cannot for the life of me think of anything that I\'ve been doing differently lately that might\'ve caused this. I don\'t use topical steroid creams. I don\'t even really use any products on my face. The only makeup I wear is mascara, which is also not a new brand or formula or anything. I don\'t use soap on my face, just whatever might run across it in the shower from my hair...but again, nothing new there. \n\nAt this point, it\'s getting worse by the day, and has gotten significantly worse over the course of the day today. I\'m planning to go to the doctor soon. Right now, I\'m looking for some expertise thoughts on what this possibly could be? Or what it might be caused by? Because to me, I seem to have symptoms that could fit many possible different things, but none are exactly spot-on and all-inclusive of my symptoms either. And also, I\'m not a doctor or medical professional. Hence, why I\'m here asking you. I will attach pictures in the comments. Thank you'"

Initially it stung like a scratch and then progressed to itching. Itching has worsened at night and the linear papules/pustules/nodules have spread around both of my ankles, this has lasted around 9 days now. Went to urgent care and the doc there suggested steroid cream but also prescribed permethrin in case of scabies infestation. Treated from head to bottom of feet with permethrin, slept in clean sheets and rewashed bedding, clothing, and towels. Rash continues to get worse and spread after permethrin. Considering another dose in a week, last dosed 3 days ago. I work as a nurse and have concern that it will spread to my hands. Wondering if it is even scabies at all. Concerning because it does itch intensely at night. I have no known contacts with scabies but did rent snowboarding equipment frequently this winter, socks were of course worn but this could have been the mode of transmission.

The second doctor said his only option is to wait until it gets worse and then amputation. The 3rd doctor was able to stent the upper leg (3 stents), open the bottom of his leg with one stent, and then tried (unsuccessfully) to open up the top again after it reoccluded about a week after placement. Theyve decided that he will need a bypass from the upper thigh to just below the knee. He is in a lot of pain from his wound. He needs a cardiac clearance before he can undergo the surgery. He has had the echocardiogram done but needs a nuclear stress test that is scheduled for 3 weeks from now. Ive tried to move it up but they say nothing is available. Over the last week hes experienced more swelling on the lower leg and foot (particularly his toes) and has developed this rash on his upper leg.

I also have twitches, a full body tremor and head tremor, RLS, and various nerve pain. I can\'t walk long distances with pain in feet...\n\nHere\'s what I can\'t get past. I\'ve seen several Rheumatologist. The first was early in on the disease process when I had little joint pain manifested. The second couldn\'t get past the thought that he thinks I have fibromyalgia (which I probably do in addition to other things), and now I am in between two new docs, one of which I see on Wednesday. I was a former Development Director, I\'m pretty aware and I know when my joints are swollen. I can physically see the swelling and distinct changes in the size of my joints, particularly in my pointer finger (MCP joint) on both hands. My xrays don\'t show bone changes and I did do a hand MRI which the radiologist described as suspicious but the last Rheum said didn\'t show anything. So I don\'t have any physical \'proof\'. I am in an unexplainable amount of pain and discomfort despite being on Celebrex. Am I approaching this wrong? What do I have to do to get a seronegative diagnosis? I think my case is sometimes too complex for anyone to digest and because of the various systemic symptoms it is preventing me from getting treatment for my joints. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you ahead of time.'"

I am a 29 year old female who needs help with her health.\n\nI am part of the chronically ill family - on facebook. They said perhaps someone on here may be able to help. I have a complex medical history however, most of my existing health issues are under control and ive had since birth - and are not inflammatory/autoimmune. I was born with a split spinal cord/spina bifida/tethered cord but these have no affect on the issues below. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the last year I have been experiencing the following...I have seen about 6 specialists, all of which have no idea what's happening. I have been put in patient by an internal physician and he couldn't figure out what was going on. One neurologist said nicely that I was 'effed' but had no answer to what is happening. \n\n\\- Severe itching that is so bad I scratch my skin off in areas\n\n\\- Severe bruising and petechiea - easy bleeding\n\n\\- Bouts of scurvy despite a healthy diet (extremely low vit c levels, bleeding/swollen gums, out of breathe, weak etc - dr has mentioned they've never seen someone so sick with scurvy let alone scurvy at all)\n\n\\- Severe iron deficiency despite eating meat\n\n\\- Severe bouts of diarhea and vomiting (ive had colonoscopy and endoscopy showing inflammation of gut but no actual reason for it - no crohns etc)\n\n\\- Neutropenia - causing severe infections. I have had sepsis twice this year \n\n\\- Constant nasal ulcers that become infected with Staph - they can't tell if the original ulcer is Staph or cold sore but they are grossly contaminated with Staph. I have to have on going anti virals and AB to control it\n\n\\- Raynauds - but it runs in the family. (Have been tested many times for Lupus (mum has lupus) and negative - however, have been put on Plaquenil to see if it helps with symptoms - i often get the butterfly rash)\n\n\\- Skin infections that turn into cellulitis quite quickly and need IV Antiobiotics\n\n\\- Episodic Vertigo but when it's bad I fall over\n\n\\- Started having seizures in 2021 - had never had seizures before that. Controlled with meds.\n\n\\- Enlarged and cupped/swollen optic nerves - waiting for neurology review but when i was in hospital they were certain it was not MS. However, I cannot have lumbar puncture. I have transient neurological symptoms such as gait issues/tremor/balance issues but hard to tell if its that or spinal issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy biggest concern is the weak immune system and severe itching and bruising - I end up in hospital way too often and am sick of feeling unwell. \n\nAny suggestions welcome because I will be pursuing another opinion and am going to start being more assertive to get help. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome photos here: [https://imgur.com/a/hILx8UI](https://imgur.com/a/hILx8UI)"""

I had a unilateral oophorectomy in 2004 and a very bad rash started 13dpo.  The rash was on both arms and legs, affecting the left side significantly more than the right (no rash at incisions).  It was extremely painful and itchy (I don\'t have pictures of this rash).  The rash started as bullseyes/targets and spread.  Swelling caused the skin to break on my legs and weep fluid, and overall the rash lasted about two weeks (it was an absolutely awful time).  Dermatologist treated with oral steroids but that caused me other issues and I really don\'t think they helped much.\n\nFast forward to my hysterectomy and oophorectomy earlier this month.  On 10dpo the rash appeared again but way less severe and limited to my left ankle ([pictures provided](https://imgur.com/a/KGmvKRe)).  Very painful and itchy, swelling caused skin to blister.  I can feel hard lumps under the skin.  No rash around my abdominal incisions, overall recovery from hysterectomy has been very good.\n\nI have had other procedures over the years that involved general anesthesia but no rash (two colonoscopies, an elective appendectomy, and a hysteroscopy with biopsy).

Any treatment suggestions?  Hot foot soaks seem to help relieve the symptoms\n\n3.  What can I do to avoid this after future procedures?  I can review the medications administered for my hysterectomy, but I doubt I can access my procedure info from 2004 (or can I)?'"

I first had a burning sensation before the rash appeared for about 3 days. My thigh would feel so hot I couldn't wear clothes over it. The rash started as red, bumpy dots. It later became small blisters. I went to a doctor and he told me to apply soap on it and leave it overnight. A day or two later, the blisters popped and my thigh became very black. The pain, however, subsided. My thigh slowly went back to its original color.\nI'm now feeling that exact burning sensation on the skin of my left zygomatic bone area.\nI guess what I am asking is if someone could perhaps give a differential diagnosis of my original rash or at least the disease process. Are there rashes treated with applying body soap overnight? The doctor didn't explain the disease process. I was also diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia at the time. But I have normal blood tests now.\nInfo:\nI'm 19. Male. And had/have no other medical problems. I take no medication now, but I can't remember if I had any meds at the time of my illness."""

No major medical issues, no meds, do not drink, smoke, or use recreational drugs. USA. Podiatrist recommending removal. Second opinion?\n\nBackground: Hello and thank you for taking the time to read my post. I am extremely anxious about the possibility of having both my big toenails removed. Some background info: I danced for two decades and played many sports, which caused problems with ingrowns on my big toenails all of my life. As an adult I am very active and love to wear high heels so they have continued to be a problem. In the last year I found a nail tech who I trust (cleanliness, gentleness, etc.) with my feet and only have pedicures done by her. Typically I leave with my big toes a little bit red, but more comfortable with continued improvement in the days following. In general I only occasionally have issues with the left big toe, but almost always have at least minor issues with the right. After my last pedicure I attended a music festival and was on my feet walking and dancing much more than usual. I did wear shoes I have worn before and not had any issues with. Unfortunately, my toes really took a beating and swelled up more than they ever have before, to the point where I made my first ever podiatry appt (5/26/23; please see details in timeline below). I was also already on antibiotics for a dental procedure, which made the level of inflammation especially concerning. The podiatrist recommended removal of the left toenail, citing that it was loose at the base and unlikely to improve on its own. He also diagnosed a granuloma on the right, and said a portion should be removed permanently.\n\nTo say I am freaking out is an understatement. Of course I want to do what is best for my health. I have always been self conscious of my toes, so the anxiety and distress this is causing me mentally is significant. More importantly, I model full time professionally, so having pretty feet is a requirement of the job and this will impact my ability to provide for myself. In addition, I will be traveling all of June (lots of walking, beach & pool time).\n\nMy Questions:\n\n* What is the best course of action?\n* Should I obtain a second opinion?\n* What course of outcome should I expect if I proceed conservatively and hold off on removal?\n* Should I continue with this routine (see below for details)?\n* How should I handle traveling--footwear, protection, etc.?\n* If I must proceed with removal, are there any cosmetic solutions?

I\'m 5\'3"" and about 140 lbs, I don\'t drink or smoke, I live on the east coast.\n\nMy medical history begins at age 7, when I received an mri due to inability to fully open one of my eyes. The mri showed a congenital asymmetry of the left lateral ventricle, but otherwise it was normal and the swelling went away after several months and we moved on.\n\nAt 12, I developed exercise induced asthma which was treated with an inhaler for 2 years before quitting sports.\n\nAt 14, I became concussed after two blows to the head a day apart. I quickly developed headaches that turned into migraines, but after a couple months of the concussion treatment plan, a majority of the symptoms improved. The fatigue and headaches lingered, which 6 months later was diagnosed as iron-deficiency anemia caused by menorrhagia which was treated by combo hormonal birth control.\n\nFor 3-4 months I had no symptoms, but the headaches and fatigue started coming back. I also started having severe nausea, vertigo, and palpitations. They reran my iron levels which came back normal. I then began falling and walking into walls with one spraining my knee so bad I needed crutches for a month. A month later, I was diagnosed with POTs and chronic migraines and was referred to cardiology and neurology.\n\nIncreasing salt and fluid intake did not improve symptoms so I was prescribed zofran, fludrocortisone, and midodrine to treat the nausea, low blood pressure, and other symptoms, none of which was very successful. I was on a new headache medication almost every other month, none had any great success with Effexor causing hallucinations and delirium and amitriptyline causing nightmares and worsening insomnia. During this time, I also had an episode of severe abdominal pain which turned out to be a kidney stone. Throughout high school, I had recurrent pinkish red rashes on my neck, jaw, and cheek.\n\nECGs throughout high school showed normal sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia. My cardiologist ran C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, and ANA which all came back normal. My CBC came back with high rbc (5.2 M/cu mm), high platelets (431 k/cu mm), high eosinophils (.56 K/cu mm) and low MCHC (30.9 g/dL). She reran the CBC with a CMP which showed high potassium (5.7 mmol/L), low carbon dioxide (17 mmol/L) and high anion gap 23 mmol/L. The second CBC showed high WBC (13.47 K/cu mm), RBC (5.71 M/cu mm), hematocrit (47.2 %), Platelets (403 K/cu mm), eosinophils (4.6%) and low mchc (30.7 g/dL).\n\nWhen I started college, I was started on concerta which had begun being used off label for POTs, and it worked very well for me with minimal side effects. Everything went smoothly until I got the sick my sophomore year of college, causing such severe abdominal pain I had to be checked for appendicitis. I was told they werent sure what it was, but it wasnt appendicitis. At this point, I was taking concerta, midodrine, fludrocortisone, birth control, topiramate, and gabapentin.\n\nI remained mostly healthy until the fall of 2019, when I started having severe recurrent abdominal pain, tremors, difficulty concentrating, nausea, and difficulty walking, at this point I stopped taking the concerta due to inability to find primary care as I moved. My cardiologist suggested I may have celiac disease and advised me to remove gluten from my diet, at this point I was having about 1 drink a week. I removed gluten and after a month symptoms had not improved, but I had begun to break through bleeding heavily. They ran a CBC, CMP, Iron panel, and screen for von willebrand\'s. My Iron Panel showed a high iron binding capacity (481 ng/ml), cmp showed elevated ALT (51 u/L), and CBC showed high rbc (5.32 Million/uL) and low MCH (26.7 pg). They ran a pelvic and abdominal ultrasound which showed a 3 cm cyst on my liver, but otherwise normal. I had an mri of the Brain and spine which came back normal other than sinusitis. I stopped the gluten free diet and stopped drinking any alcohol. Then covid-19 lockdown began, and after a couple weeks my symptoms began to improve.\n\nI remained relatively fine until August 2020 when I caught covid-19 and despite relatively mild symptoms, they continued for months. I had severe brain fog, confusion, shortness of breath, and fatigue that continued for almost 3 months. I began having severe allergic reactions to anything and everything and started breaking out in red rashes and hives every time I showered. After 3 months, my covid symptoms improved, but the new rashes remained. I changed laundry detergent and they began to improve. At this point, I stopped taking any medications other than birth control and benadryl.\n\nIn July 2021, I started to notice that my B.O. was beginning to smell like wet paint, and towards the end of July I started back on concerta. August 2021, I had a migraine that lasted 4-5 days. As soon as it began to improve, I had severe pain in my right shoulder that kept me from being able to move my arm. The shoulder pain only lasted 1-2 days. After that, I started having severe intermittent abdominal pain in the RUQ, RLQ, and LUQ. I was referred to gastroenterology who suggested a MRCP and a low fat diet with increased fiber to improve any constipation. Before I could schedule my MRCP, I started having visual distortions including floaters and visual static that look like tiny dots across the entire visual field. I never had aura with my migraines before so it was a little concerning. Shortly after, I developed weakness primarily in the right leg causing difficulty walking and numbness and tingling on my arms and legs.\n\nI went to the ER where they ran an EKG, estimated GFR, Tropinin T, HCG, CBC, CMP, and CT of the brain. The CBC showed high RBC (5.15 M/mcl), hematocrit (43%), and low mch (25.8 pg) and mchc (30.9 g/dL). I was referred to ophthalmology which ordered an mri of the brain and orbits which was normal other than cysts in the maxillary sinuses. My visual field and ophthalmic imaging came back normal. She also ran AQP4 AB, RO52, RO60, AND LA IGG, LYME ANTIBODIES, TREPONEMA PALLIDUM, SED RATE, C-REACTIVE PROTEIN, MYELIN OLIGODENDROCYTE GLYCOPROTEIN IGG, ANTI NEUTROPHIL CYTOPLASMIC ANTIBODY, ANA, AND ANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME, all came back normal. At this point, I began having severe muscle cramps and confusion with black outs. I followed up with cardiology, which assured me that the new symptoms were not related to my POTs.\n\nI began seeing a new neurologist who only did telehealth, she noted that I was unable to complete the tandem walk without falling, but the rest of the neuro exam was unremarkable. She ran a myositis panel, musk antibody, acetylcholine recep binding, and aquaporin 4 igg which were all normal. They ran and EMG with nerve conduction study which came back normal. MRI of the complete spine was also normal. Next was an EEG which came back normal as well. Then TSH, Thyroxine (T4), and vitamin b12. I started having difficulty swallowing which led to a fluoro esophagram which showed delayed stomach emptying and a small hiatal hernia. They then did a upper endoscopy with esophageal biopsy, which also came back normal. The neurologist tried beta blockers which dropped my heart rate down to the low 40s.\n\nI started seeing a new primary who ran Hep B and C, Rheumatoid factor, anti-ccp, anti dna, and porphyrins. My anti-ccp came back mildly elevated (22) and porphyrins, fract, random showed high coproporphyrin I (49.3). Genetic testing for porphyria came back negative. They did a cutaneous never biopsy came back normal as well. I saw another specialist who noted a mildly positive hoffmans sign on the right side. He started me on several types of vitamin and supplements, none of which helped. In June 2022, I started having sudden improvement only 3-4 after discontinuing concerta. I stopped having symptoms until October 2022 when all the symptoms gradually began to return starting with the abdominal pain.\n\nRheumatology ran x-rays of my neck, hands, and feet which showed minor instability in C3 and swelling in my feet. She noted hypermobility in my ankles, but otherwise normal and told me I likely don\'t have RA and referred me to ortho. I finally saw allergy who told me I likely have MCAS, and gastro sent in a referral for a gastric emptying study to confirm diagnosis of gastroparesis. Ortho ran an MRI of my c-spine in flexion and CT. The CT was normal and the MRI showed a loss of cervical lordosis.

She remembers being weak as a child and having to be carried up any stairs including at school. She believed she would not live to adulthood.\n\nAny ideas what surgery she may have had?

Not had a problem before, but today when I removed the clear dressing and wiped away the cream prior to the injection, there's a slightly swollen looking red rash over some of the area the cream was on. There was no damaged skin or issues when I applied the cream, and it does appear to be where the cream was rather than where the micropore tape was on my skin. I do get some redness and occasionally a rash with micropore if left on for a while, but that area was only a little red today and again this rash is not where the tape was.\n\n\nDoes this indicate any potential issues? Or is it more likely a one off issue? The rash is not itchy or dry, and currently is still numb from the local anaesthetic effect of the cream. However it is still reddened and raised after 30 mins of the cream being removed. I also found the clexane to be more painful when injected today despite the surface being numbed properly. If it makes any difference, the site I used is on the right of my abdomen a little above the scar from my appendix removal (avoiding scarred areas for injection sites and alternating sides each day).\n\nCan add photo in comments if helpful."""

I am 31, female, 510 and somewhere around 200 pounds 7 weeks postpartum.\n\nI have never smoked, drink very rarely (once or twice per month - no more than 1 drink), and have never done drugs.\n\nI had severe hypertension a week postpartum and was put on 300 mg labetalol 3x per day and 30 mg of nifedipine 2x per day and since then my BPs have been manageable. Most of my readings are in the 120s over 70s at the moment.\n\nThe issue Ive been having the last few weeks is residual swelling in my ankles/feet and lower legs that is not resolving. Its not outrageously swollen (like my immediate postpartum swelling was - I got that under control after I went into emergency with a BP of 200/110. They put me on IV Labetalol and Hydralazine and I peed like a banshee for about 4 days straight after that. They kept me there to rule out postpartum preeclampsia and put me on the meds Im currently on now. A lower dose did not touch my BP). After my return from the hospital after about 4 days, I had completely diuresed and my ankles looked completely normal again.\n\nAnd yes -- docs have taken my blood and urine a million times and, even though I had SO many symptoms of preeclampsia (pre and postpartum), my labs always came back clear. No protein in urine and no elevated liver enzymes. I just want to get rid of this swelling!!! Its starting to make my joints very sore!!! I also pee a LOT now. More than I did prior to becoming pregnant. \n\nSo here are my questions:\n\n1. Is my residual swelling from the Nifedipine? I was on Labetalol for 5 weeks prior to giving birth for hypertension and did not notice any swelling from that medication. \n2. Could the swelling be from something else? Kidneys not functioning normally? I would imagine that my urine would have shown protein if that was the case and it hasn't.\n3. Is the excessive peeing also possibly from the Nifedipine? There's no way I am still diuresing from the IV hydralazine I was on 7 weeks ago - LOL.\n\nNow I've been on Labetalol and Nifedipine for at least 6 weeks straight. Is it too late for me to switch blood pressure meds? Will I have adverse side effects going off nifedipine cold turkey if I switch now?\n\nThanks in advance!!!"""

My soon to be former dentist does not have an emergency after hours contact so I scheduled a Teledoc appointment who prescribed me Augmentin. I was suspicious about this seeing as Amoxicillin and Augmentin are very similar, the latter having clavulanic acid. My suspicions were correct, I woke up on Sunday with the entire side of my face and under jaw swollen and promptly went to the ER out of fear that it would move to my throat and start shutting down my airways.\nThey immediately gave me a CT scan and said that I have cellulitis due to the mouth abscess.

Throughout the day, swelling diminished but was still there which I expected.\nWoke up this morning and the swelling didn\'t necessarily get bigger in that spot, but did spread a little bit towards my tonsil area but not my throat, no hindered breathing at all. Even still, I freaked out and called the doctor and they told me to monitor it and if it got any worse at all, even a tad, to get back to the ER immediately, but at the time it wasn\'t an emergency, luckily it actually has got a bit better. \n\nI\'m afraid to go to sleep tonight, during the day while awake this is taking care of it seems, a lot more slowly than I was expecting but it is working. \n\nShould I be sleeping elevated instead of parallel to the ground? Is lying prone a potential cause for the increase in swelling? How long does it typically take for this antibiotic to take affect and knock out the swelling and infection, especially since I\'ve already been giving 900 mg of it intravenously? I don\'t feel sick or fatigued, no fever; I don\'t have any difficulty at all breathing, in fact the tonsil swelling has gone down quite a bit.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1369o51/medical_mystery_mass_on_lower_back_that_wont_show/,"b""medical mystery: mass on lower back that won't show on imaging""","b""Hello. I'm an 18yo female, 163 cm and 63 kg. For almost two years I have had an odd mass on my lower back, visible superficially and can be palpated. I'm not comfortable sharing photos, so I'll do my best to describe it: It's about 7cm across, 4cm in height, right at the base of my spine in the lumbar area. It is quite noticeable when looking at my bare back. There has never been any discoloration, abnormal swelling (other than the presence of the mass), exit wound/drainage, pus, or anything of the sort. I have pain when I sit/lay down for too long. Most of the time when I feel it, it's as if walking with a  rock in my shoe (but on my lower back). On the worst days, it is aching/stabbing. Other than when I sit down for too long, the pain is sporadic. There is no numbness in my legs or my spine and my reflexes are all healthy and functioning. There has never been any prior trauma to the area. Visually, it seems to be a large lipoma. But here's the kicker: it won't show up on ANY imaging (I've had a CT, an ultrasound, and two MRIS a year apart). Here's the timeline of this mass:\n\n**July 2021:** I noticed an abnormal mass on my lower back and go to my primary doctor, who is worried that it is a pilonidal cyst, and she refers me to a general surgeon at the hospital.\n\n**First Hospital Visit August 2021:** General surgeon meets me for five minutes, looks at it, and tells me that it is a lipoma and to come back if it hurts more or changes.\n\n**May 2022:** The mass is still present and still causing pain, so I go to see a different general surgeon who is confident that she could remove the (assumed to be at this time) lipoma, but wants imaging of it so that she can see how deep it is/far it reaches to remove it. She orders an ultrasound.\n\n**Ultrasound:** Imaging is unremarkable and nothing shows up, despite visual confirmation of the mass. The general surgeon orders an MRI with and without contrast.\n\n**First MRI:** Imaging comes back unremarkable again. The general surgeon refers me to a specialist an hour away, another general surgeon with experience in the lumbar region and hernias. At this point, it is unclear what the mass is.\n\n**October 2022:** The specialist does a physical exam and is just as confused as the previous surgeon. He decides to order a CT scan to see if it shows up there.\n\n**CT Scan:** The mass, once again, does not show up on the CT. The specialist gives me two options: go to the pain clinic for pain management or be referred to a spine specialist instead, recommending the spine specialist to see if there's something he knows. He is uncomfortable with doing surgery because he has no idea how extensive the mass is and determines that removing it at this point would not be worth the risk.\n\n**April 2023:** I see the spine specialist and he says the same thing as the last surgeon, but this time says he can see hints of the mass in the initial MRI, but the edges are not discrete, and repeats the same sentiments about not wanting to remove it without knowing what he's getting into. At this point, my last MRI was about a year ago, so I go in for a second one with and without contrast.\n\n**Second MRI (where I'm at now):** Just got my results back, with the radiologists commenting that they cannot see anything in the imaging, and neither can I. Unchanged from my first MRI.\n\nI need to schedule an appointment to talk with him, but I expected these results and I know there won't be anything that he can do. Currently, I'm just so frustrated... I've had to deal with this mass for almost two years. The pain isn't debilitating but when you have it consistently off and on for this amount of time, it is awful. Pain management seems to be the only other option currently, but I can't help but feel angered by that. Nobody knows what it is or how to remove it. I feel ugly with it on my back. I have a pretty rough fear of needles, and despite the pain, it's also not intense enough for me to feel motivated enough to try and overcome my fear with consistent steroid shots to the area.\n\nI don't expect answers here, not at all, and I'm aware of how little there is to do. I fully trust my doctors' opinions and understand the risks of operating without imaging. I'm just curious if anyone here in this subreddit has ideas about what it could be so I can research or bring it up to the specialist when I see him again for the next appointment.\n\nHave fun being confused.\n\nEdit: Fixed a timeline error."""

Worried about liver and kidneys.',"b""30, female, 5'6', 230lbs\n\nI am not an everyday drinker. About 9 months ago, I was gifted a bottle of wine for the first time at the worst time.

Usually, I'm a social drinker, but after that bottle, I brought another and for about two weeks I was having about two glasses of wine a night.\n\nThat's when I noticed that my feet started swelling towards the end of those two weeks. I got a little worried and stopped drinking for a while. Then my husband brought home some bottles of soju that we usually find at our favorite Korean restaurant.

I got pretty drunk and again I noticed my feet swelling. \n\nI tried to contact my doctor about it because Google was telling me that something could be something was wrong with my liver, kidneys, or heart. She wasn't concerned when I told her how much I was drinking because she said that it takes years for those things to happen with consistent drinking. I was going to make an appointment with her, but she left the clinic.\n\nI kind of let it go and only drank socially from then on and it hasn't happened again from what I can remember until today. I had two strong drinks of soda and vodka and I could feel my feet swelling. I have an appointment with a new doctor on Wednesday and I'm hoping to ask for a full blood panel and to check my liver enzymes and other things. I do think it may have happened today because I wasn't drinking water at all today - only an iced coffee in the morning.\n\nI'm just really worried that this could be an indication of something being wrong.

It was dying for the last couple of days and no one noticed. We noticed the symptoms of the cat only at 9 pm\n- uncoordinated movements\n- extremely lethargic\n- wont drink water or eat food\n- randomly wandering around\n- labored breathing \n- was throwing up a bit of yellow stomach bile\n- skinny and had its belly skin drooping \n- had very light pink gums\n\nIt was obviously dying. Our dad did not believe us that it was dying and told us everything would be fine the next morning. My brother tried giving it water by forcing it down its throat. I know he meant the best, but there was a chance he got water down into its lungs. \n\nAt 9:30ish as he was trying to do so it bit him on the finger and some blood was drawn. There is a skin flap now.\n\nA minute later he washed his hands and poured isopropyl alcohol on his finger and put on a bandaid. I was afraid the cat died of septic shock given the symptoms. Just a theory tho. The cat died later at 11:03. It had extreme labored breathing and after it stopped breathing it spasmed like hell for a while. We buried it. I think it died from fluid in its lungs, from either whatever it had before. Theres a chance my brother could have got water down its lungs but thats ok, he was trying his best to help the cat. \n\nAnyway, I tried convincing my dad to bring my brother to the ER but because he is from the Soviet Union, is very stubborn, and has generally avoided most medical care and scorned any medical advice Ive ever tried talking to him about, he doesnt believe me cat bites can be dangerous. We fought and he went to bed.\n\nI am aware this can transmit rabies or become infected or both.

I\'m a 40 year old white male with multiple medical conditions some of which are, Hypertention 2, IBD, congenital spinal stenosis, lumbar disk disease,  ADD, MDD, PTSD, geralized anxiety disorder among others.  Also, 2 years ago I had an extremely bad case of Diverticulitis with Perforations that got so bad that I wound up having an abscess in my abdomen the size of a tangerine.  I wound up gettinga a catheter abscess drain put in multiple (3) times but the abscess kept coming back almost instantly so they said I need to have emergency surgery to remove 13"" of my colon and part of my rectum.  The surgery was open and left a 14"" scar from above my belly button to just above my groin.  I also had a colostomy bag put in and had to wear it for 3 months before they could reverse it.\n\nWell now that some of my medical history is out of the way, I\'m really hoping I can get an idea of what this problem might be or even just some advice on how to proceed because I am not able to get an appointment with my PC Doctor until March 29th.\n\nI\'ve had this problem for several years now and it just came out of nowhere one day and has been there ever since but it seems to be getting worse recently.  What\'s happening is that there is a spot on my upper shin, roughly 2 inches below my left knee that basically hurts all the time.  it\'s a dull pain as long as I don\'t move but once I start moving it hurts more and when I bend my knee I feel this weird feeling.  It\'s like the spot is tight and the more I bend the knee the more it stretches and then eventually when I get my knee bent past a certain point, I feel a sort of pop/snap.  I keep describing it like it feels like a rubberband snapping under my skin.  It\'s not a feeling that I\'ve ever felt before.  It\'s not a muscle thing I don\'t think.  It feels like it\'s just below the skin and directly over the Tibia bone.  There is a visible blue dot on my leg about an inch away from the painful area that my doctor glanced at years ago and said that it was just a spider vein and that it was no concern but this was years before I wound up having these issues.\n\nMy biggest concern is that blood clots run in my family and just about 2 weeks ago, both of my legs started swelling so bad that when I pressed on them, it left and indent for a few minutes.  I checked my blood pressure and I was at 148/120 and a pulse rate of 140, so I got worried about the symptoms I was having and went to the ER.  I was in the waiting room for 5 hours before I finally got a room, at which point my blood pressure had slightly gone down but the swelling was still there.  The nurse took some blood and ran a EKG and then left.  I didn\'t see anyone for the next 2 hours and it was 3 am so I was getting so tired that I could barely keep my eyes open.  I decided to go out and ask the nurse when I would see the doctor and she said that he was the only doctor on staff and he\'s managing 190 patients and that it could be a few more hours.  She said that my blood work showed that my blood oxygen levels were fine at 94% and then she said that blood clots in the leg don\'t cause swelling in the legs and that the swelling was probably an issue with my diet and not anything to be overly concerned about.  She told me I could wait for the doctor or I could go home.  I was so tired that I just decided to leave and make an appointment with my Primary Care Doctor.   That\'s where I\'m at now,  waiting until the end of March to see my doctor.  So now I have no idea if these problems are linked or whether they have nothing to do with each other.\n\nIf anyone here has any ideas on what it could be, I would really appreciate your thoughts.  Thanks.'"

Potential medical malpractice, unethical behavior, the works.'","b'**History:**\n\nHello all. My mother has a lengthy medical history. I will start from the top. She is 44 years old, was diagnosed (but incorrectly staged) with HER2 positive breast cancer 5 years ago. She was originally staged at Stage II, but before her double mastectomy she got a second opinion from another hospital, where a panel of doctors reviewed her scans and re-staged her at Stage IIIB. From what I can recall, I know that she obviously had malignant tumor(s?) in the breast tissue itself, on both sides, and I know for a fact that it had spread to the lymph nodes on both sides of her body. She had another tumor that I do not know was ever classified, but they considered it to be in the ""breast region"" so treated the tumor as though it was a part of her breast cancer. So I imagine that would be considered a tumor in the chest wall (?). She successfully beat cancer a few months after harsh treatment, and had a double mastectomy and affected lymph nodes removed. Successfully completed radiation, and has been in remission since early 2019. After the mastectomy, she also had spacers and eventually implants put in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Presenting problems:**\n\nFast forward to recently. She had an unrelated MRI or CT (can\'t remember which) roughly a year ago that showed a 1.3cm (?) cyst on one of her ovaries. No follow-up was recommended for the cyst I believe, they ruled it to not be a cause for concern. About a month ago, she had a regular visit with her OB, where they did an ultrasound to show that the cyst had grown to 3cm. Further imaging and tests showed that it was just a cyst, no malignancy. After my mother\'s mastectomy, I thought it would be wise of her to also have a hysterectomy. Given her age and her positive HPV status, I just thought it was the best course of action, but she was against it. Now with the cyst, she automatically jumped to talking about a hysto. In the same day, she had a biopsy on one of her breasts, because she had some kind of skin thing that she described as ""a bruise that hasn\'t gone away"". Biopsy showed no malignancy for whatever it was, but the biopsy left her with a hole in her skin, about the size of hole punch. When you looked through the hole, you could literally see the surface of her implant, and if you were smart enough to shine a flashlight on it, you could clearly tell it was her implant you were looking at. I don\'t know if that\'s standard practice or what. It seems odd to me, like you\'re asking for an infection that way, but we were aware of that risk so she kept it covered after the biopsy.\n\nSo, hopping back to the hysterectomy. Her OB also thought that at this point with her clear symptoms of the beginning of menopause, age, HPV status, cancer history, and cyst, that it was probably a good time to talk about a hysto. My mother eagerly agreed, not wanting even the smallest hairline of a possibility of cancer ever being in the conversation ever again. She was scheduled very quickly for a hysterectomy. In the meantime, the hole in her skin was not closing. At one point the skin seemed to thin and stretch around, creating a smaller hole but thinner skin, which I imagine was the hole closing. However, even two weeks after the biopsy, the skin remained red, warm to the touch, and irritated. She revisits the oncology office that did the biopsy. **Here comes the fucked up part.**\n\nThe first person that visits her in the oncology office (PA? I don\'t know, wasn\'t there) examines the hole in her skin ***WITHOUT GLOVES***\\- that part I think needs to be made very abundantly clear. This physician immediately says that we\'re looking at a scab, not her implant. My mother is insistent. ""That\'s not a scab"" she says. This physician brings in another physician, who is thankfully gloved, and this physician- a true genius, probably top of their class- decides they can\'t tell. So they do what I did (not a doctor or brilliant by any means) the commonsense approach, turned out the lights and used their flashlight and confirmed that we were in fact looking at her implant. This doctor says ""Walk quickly across the street to your plastic surgeon, he needs to see this. I think the implant may need to come out"".\n\n**So that was the long story.** Here comes the shorter part. The plastic surgeon was on the fence about removing the implant. He decided to try sewing the hole, and seeing what happened. Shocker: it didn\'t fix anything. I don\'t think his actions made anything worse- I think it was ""worse"" to begin with. The skin became more inflamed and irritated. Plastics said ""Well add on implant removal to your scheduled hysterectomy. If anything gets worse or you start to feel weird, go to the hospital immediately"". So exactly that happens. 4 days before surgery she starts to feel off and immediately goes to the hospital. They check her out, WBC and bloodwork are good, she checks in with her surgeons who give her the OK to go back home. That lasted one whole day. Closer to the end of the day 1 day later, she starts feeling significantly worse- infection feels like its traveling, shoulder starts hurting, head is pounding, more skin on her breast is now red and inflamed, hole is oozing. So she finds herself back in the hospital. WBC is not only elevated, but a good jump from where it had been previously. Different WBC components are also not only elevated, some are now double what they were 36 hours ago. So she\'s admitted, given more IV antibiotics, and she stays until the day of her surgery.\n\n**Surgery:**\n\nSurgery goes well. Very well. Cultures are taken of the infection, sent off for testing. Recovery was brutal at first but she\'s exactly 1 week post-op now and doing very well. However, we just got the results back from the culture of the infection, and I have never been more pissed off and ready to attack someone in my entire life. **The culture from the infection states this exactly:** ""Occasional staphylococcus epidermidis. Possible skin contaminant. No further workup. No neutrophils noted. No anaerobes isolated."" One quick Google search tells me that this type of staph infection is commonly called the ""accidental pathogen"" and is most likely caused by MEDICAL DEVICE CONTAMINATION. So, correct me if I\'m wrong. My mother has been a nurse and worked in the lab pretty much her entire life. She knows how to care for a wound, and was properly taking care of the wound and keeping it covered. No one I know has any present staph infection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes this mean that my mother needed to have an additional surgery on top of her hysto because of SOMEONE ELSE\'S mistake??? How easy is it to obtain this type of infection on your own, in your own home?? She doesn\'t go to the gym or public places (other than the hospital I guess) and she most certainly kept it covered, but also, it\'s on her breast- so not only covered to keep it sanitary, but also under her bra, under her shirt. I\'m just incredibly frustrated because her plastic surgeon said from the beginning that what they did (which part of it he\'s never specified) is not right and should have never happened. It really doesn\'t help my faith in my local hospitals that are supposed to take care of me.\n\nSo please, feel free to drop any information you have, medical mumbojumbo and all. I want to know everything I can about this type of infection- how easily you can pick it up, how easily it is transferred, and how likely it is that she obtained it from either the biopsy or the medical office that examined her without gloves.'"

One of those other things is that I have weighed \\~160lbs for my entire adult life regardless of what I eat, even living a *very* sedentary lifestyle.  Well I discovered some time ago that, among the various other issues I was aware of, my body doesn\'t produce (any/enough) cortisol so I\'ve been seeing an endocrinologist who has prescribed hydrocortisone as replacement therapy, plus levothyroxine for a similar issue with my thyroid.  I\'ve been taking them for about 8 months now and have noticed some weirdness with my weight.  I get weighed at every doctor visit (which is the only way I was even aware of this, \\~35 years of not having to worry about my weight meant I didn\'t even own a bathroom scale), and the first couple I didn\'t notice anything.  By the 3rd visit which was after 3 months I noticed that I had lost 10lbs but I didn\'t think much about it because while it was outside the normal range of fluctuations I figured it was just a temporary thing.  However, on my 4th and most recent visit after another 3 months I noticed that I had gained 30lbs which was a shock to say the least.  Weirdly, some of the fat I have gained has been around my hips and knees, especially on the inside above and below the knee, and it feels kind of hard and the joints feel a bit stiff now and even sore sometimes.\n\nI bought a bathroom scale and downloaded an app to help me track my weight and I\'ve been weighing myself every morning since my last doctor\'s visit (about a month ago) and I continue to slowly gain weight despite cutting snacks and junk food out of my diet and spending 30 minutes on an exercise bike most mornings and it\'s getting to the point where I\'m getting concerned.  I know levothyroxine can affect metabolism and weight so I stopped taking that for a week and it didn\'t seem to change anything, so I then stopped taking both of the new meds for a week and the rate of gain has slowed somewhat, so it seems to be the hydrocortisone causing it.\n\nMy actual questions:  \nIs this normal?  I\'ve never had to deal with weight gain before so I have no idea what\'s normal and what isn\'t, but losing and then gaining weight seems weird, having semi-hard fat around my knees that makes them feel stiff and sore sometimes seems weird, etc.  Is there anything I can do about this, any other form of cortisol I could take that wouldn\'t cause the weight gain?  Is not taking the hydrocortisone a reasonable response to this?  My doctor warned me that I could die if I stopped taking it and got sick or was in a car accident or something, but I\'ve gone my entire life without it even being really sick on occasion and not had any issues so I dunno how to evaluate that warning.  Is this entirely normal and everyone else deals with it all the time and I\'m just freaking out because I\'ve been abnormal all my life?'"

In mid April, my wife noticed a small bruise-like mark on the back/interior side of my left knee. At first I thought it was a small bruise earned during house work or me just being dumb - but turned out it never went away. I have a picture taken a few days after I noticed it - and a picture taken a few days ago. Looks about the same - hasn\'t changed in size. No pain, no swelling, and the area is not warm/hot to the touch - only knew it was there because my wife saw it. Is it raised? No, its totally flat. Has it changed in size or location since first notice? Nope. Do have anything else like this on my body or have I in the past? Nope. Has anything major changed in my life in the last 6 months? Yes, I have been dieting and exercising considerable more then I have in the last 6-7 years, I have been for about 3 months consistently now. I also stopped drinking anything with caffeine about 5 months ago (apparently it helped fix a lot of my anxiety issues). Does it change in color? Yup, all the time. So if I am laying down for a while, its color fades away until is rather hard to even notice but you can still see it. If I stand up and put weight on my leg, I notice this purple-ish color return. Logically - I believed this meant it has something to do with my veins or circulation? I have a 3rd photo but this 3rd image was taken like 2 years ago (and its extremely poor quality so not worth posting). To my eyes, it looks like its the same ""mark"" in the same place which may mean I have had this for a few years and never noticed it. I can not be 100% sure that is accurate but thought it may be worth noting. Do I think it just showed up? Unknown - only relevant statement I can offer on that is she noticed it right when I switched over from my long pants to shorts all the time due to spring weather. That makes me think it may have been there for a while before. Either way - I will ask my primary about it, but that appointment was supposed to be today and they delayed it another month on me, so wondering about this is starting to weigh on me. Images below.\n\nI do not have a history of bad bruising, and I have no known issues with circulation, heart issues, blood clotting, or anything else like that - and yes I have yearly check ups with the docs. \n\nIf any of this rings a bell to anyone, would be most welcome to get some feed back!

I've had a roller-coaster of a time with doc visits, and I just want to know what other medical professionals think of my situation. Apologies if this is really lengthy, I just want to be detailed in case anything matches up.\n\nFemale, 21, 150lbs, 5'3, no smoking, occasional alcohol and marijuana use\n\nCurrent diagnoses: Bipolar II, Major Depressive, Generalized Anxiety, Asthma, and Seasonal Allergies\n\nMedications include: Venlafaxine 75mg daily, Lamotrigine 100mg daily, Albuterol inhaler with a spacer as needed (1 puff), One a day women's viatmins, vitamin D, Iron, and Zinc. Oral contraceptive once daily. Have missed for 2 weeks due to waiting on prescription. No chance of pregnancy.\n\nI used to take Loratadine (Claritin) 10mg daily, and now take Xyzal 5mg every night. I also switched from 1 spray each nostril of Flonase once in the morning and once at night, to Mometasone Furoate 50mg 1 spray each nostril daily. I have also recently been prescribed *Olopatdine Hydrochloride* 665mcg 2 sprays each nostril as needed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere it started:\n\nI lived with my boyfriend in a home with dogs, cats, mold, carpet, the works. After a year of living there, starting July 2022 and ending January 2023 (when I moved out) I would have ***severe*** sinus headaches, pressure, pain, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, migraines, ear pain, congestion, and just about every symptom of an ear infection and sinus infection. Each time I had went to urgent care, as I could not get in with my PCP, and they would prescribe me an antibiotic and I would continue with my cold medicine. After 2 weeks, all would be fine, until it starts back up again. This would happen 3-4 times in the span of 7 months.\n\nAfter the 3rd or 4th time, which included the added symptoms of strep throat and COVID, both of which I tested negative for,  I made an appointment with an ENT to see what's up. The ENT said it's most likely all allergies, and suggested I do a saline nose rinse twice a day and keep up on my antihistamines. I was referred to the Allergy Dept. for skin testing.\n\nI unfortunately had a god awful time during my skin test. My nurse was very rude and my doctor was too cut and dry for me to understand what was going on. Although I'm not deathly allergic to anything, I do present reactions to most grasses (those common in the midwest), a few trees, cats, dogs, and dust mites. Remember dust mites. The sheet that was used to track the tests did not say I was tested for mold. These answers I could figure as much. I have had reactions to these allergens previously, but none of them had given me the symptoms described above. When I'm around cats, dogs, and grass abundantly, I present a few itchy spots that look like nothing more than a dot or poke.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere we're at now:\n\nI frequently visit my boyfriend in his new apartment. He brought his mattress from home. At least once a week, I wake up to dozens of new welts on my body. These are reminiscent of mosquito bites to me, for they are anywhere from golf ball to softball sized, red, itchy, and mildly painful. These cause mild fatigue as I feel like I've literally been eaten alive. We have inspected the mattress and box springs, and no bugs can be found so there's no bed bugs. My best assumption is dust mites. We wash the bedding weekly, I sprayed down the mattress and boxsprings with a 1:1 ratio of water and white vinegar, along with some peppermint and tea tree oil. We also added a zip up mattress cover. At this point, I'll do anything to stop these bugs. **He does not get any bites, itchiness, or reactions whatsoever. It is only me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday is Wednesday. \n\n* **Saturday** night I go to a party, have some drinks (3-4 mixed drinks), swim in a warm temp. pool and get pool water in my eyes, ears, nose, throat. I go inside to the very cold house and can feel a sore throat coming on. \n* I wake up **Sunday** morning feeling like I got hit by a truck. I can barely move, barely think, I'm shivering and shaking, I feel nauseous, I feel dead. I spend most of the day sleeping, and if I'm not sleeping I'm crying out of pure pain and exhaustion. I am starving but I cannot fathom eating any food. My lymph nodes are so swollen I can see them coming out of my neck, they had never been so painful in my life. I miss my medications this morning, and the Xyzal the night prior. \n* **Monday** I wake up to triple the amount of bites I would previously get. I am feeling better than I was the day before. I take my medicine with some water and applesauce, and immediately throw it up. I call my provider to ask if I should retake my medication, as google is giving me mixed signals, and I am suggested to not take them. Except for a few crying spells, the rest of the day I am feeling alright. I am catching up on my water intake and trying to take it easy. I use my saline rinse and gently massage my neck with CBD oil and use OTC swimmer's ear drops. These help immensely.\n* **Tuesday** I experience the most de-realization, de-personalization, dissociative episode ever. My dream the previous night (I blame the Effexor) has me so strung out I feel like I'm still in it. I don't know who I am, where I am, or what I'm doing. *(Not really here nor there, but it definitely added to the experience.)* I go to my therapy appointment that day and feel better now that I've gone out and socialized a little. On my way home to my parents, I notice something in my left eye. That night it turns into pink eye. Bad. No itching, only pain, burning, swelling, and discharge.\n* **Wednesday** **(today)**  I wake up and both my eyes are glued shut with this mucus, discharge, what have you. I immediately find an appointment within my PCP's office to ask about my eyes and my welts. She says they are allergies due to me not keeping up on my antihistamines and I am prescribed prednisone and antibiotic eye drops. She also says that my body is reacting so strongly because I had my wisdom teeth removed 2 weeks ago, which healed perfectly fine, and I underwent the skin test, my body is so stressed and wore out that it is reacting harshly to allergens. She suggested I rest and take the next few days off of work.\n\nAs of right now, my eyes are getting better and the itchiness of my welts are starting to go away. But I cannot wrap my head around how or why these are all caused by allergies. I have never reacted like this in my life. Is it stress? I am prone and exposed to a lot of stress due to my mental health, and it is something I am trying to work on between my therapists and psychiatrist. \n\nIf you made it this far, thank you. I hope someone out there can sympathize and maybe make sense of this madness. It's been a very tiring time. I will be linking images below. \n\nEdit: Medication added."""

I will add a TLDR at the end.\n\nI'll also add that my partner knows far more about dealing with doctors than I do, I only really understand what he has explained to me regarding the situation. Maybe someone here would know more?\n\nMy partner has a history of many medical issues, both physical and mental. He's had an undiagnosed autoimmune discorder of some-sort for years, and been going to doctors since he was around 10 years old for issues regarding that alongside scoliosis, joint pain, sleep issues, severe depression, etc.\n\nThe problem is that when he was young, his mother was extremely abusive. Of the many things she did, one was lying to doctors. Whenever they would go to a doctor, she would lie on the spot about random behavioral symptoms, disregard very serious health concerns, and try to make herself look sad (for attention/pity I guess??).\n\nDoctors refused to believe anything was wrong, and he has been marked down for being an emotional hypochondriac on his chart for a large portion of his life, and as being disrespectful (for being upset when he was not being listened to or ignored.\n\nHe moved out to live with me at 18, roughly 5 years ago now. The thing is, because of his past chart entries, nearly every doctor we've seen in the last several years has either brushed him off as someone seeking drugs or has simply passed him off to another doctor. It's been an endless loop of being sent from one doctor to the next and back to the first again, if he is even listened to at all\n\nI think, ideally, removing or atleast correcting false/exaggerated information from years ago might help. But we also live in another state hours away now. So if anyone has been in a similar situation before or could offer any advice at all, about any of this, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend had abusive mother, has a very poor medical record because of this, which causes all doctors to disregard him as just somone seeking drugs. He needs help with medical issues but cannot find anyone to listen.

To summarize the stomach problems have mostly resided since April, which is why I didn't mention them outside of this summary.\n   * Around the same time my Heartburn began, I started sleeping on my side to reduce the amount of reflux, the next day my vision problems began (starting with Visual Snow)\n   * March 6th, wake up in the middle of the night, unable to breathe. I get up and do some breathing exercise. I presume the stomach acid must have gotten into my lungs. From that night onwards, for the entire duration of the stomach problems I only sleep elevated and on my back and the problems don't return.\n   * Went to the ER more often in the last few months than I did my entire life. \n   * I did multiple blood tests (including Glandular fever \\[aftershocks from cold\\] and Toxiplamosis \\[cat bite\\], nothing out of the ordinary) and ECG.\n   * Due to the headaches, I also went to the MRI. They scanned the head, but didn't find anything out of the ordinary.\n   * My eyes where examined in late February and Mid March by two different eye doctors. Both said my eyes are fine, but suggested glasses. I wore them on-off for about a month from the beginning of March, but they didn't help with the VS, or the light sensitivity, so I returned them.\n   * The second eye doctor said that it may be a blood circulation problem on my neck/back\n* End of March - End of April\n   * Continue to visit a optician (who thinks that neck problems might be responsible for the vision problems). They said I should try to clear the possible circulation and or neck problems sorted out before considering new glasses.\n   * Visit a physiotherapist and osteopathy multiple times.\n   * Vision problems fluctuate, after visiting the physiotherapist.\n* Last Week (May 15th - 19th)\n   * Whilst looking up, I briefly saw black (I have had something similar my entire life, but never that intense or that long, usually it is over in less than a second, this time it were at least 3-5) and heard a loud pounding before sitting down. Since then my neck/cervical spine (nape) pressure worsened a lot. I've been to the ER that night, the doc didn't think it was anything serious. \n   * The physiotherapist checked the neck and couldn't find anything. They think it is stress and also \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry, if I went overboard, I just wanted to give the most detailed explanation I could and I'd rather mention everything I can, than miss something crucial.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent Medication:\n\n* None (exlcuding vitamin Iron, Magnesium, D3, B12 supplements)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExisting medical problems:\n\n* ADH, not that it is relevant.\n* Unidentified allergies (likely to poles and a new one to something that is in speculoos cookies and friy spice \\[only started with the symptoms\\])\n* Stomach problems (likely linked to milk products)\n* Black out when getting up too fast\n* Black out (less than a second) when looking directly up\n* Back problems (one side was less developed at birth, but training was able to mostly even this out. Interestingly enough, it seems to have returned after being unable to work out for the past few months).\n\nDon't drink, don't smoke.

I was taking Gaviscon advance tablets UK version, which is considered the gold standard in sodium alginate therapy to prevent acid coming from the stomach into the esophagus. It worked like a miracle! It was the only medication that has ever worked for me and gave me a quality of life I havent had in years. \n\nUnfortunately, after starting to take it, I developed rashes on both inside elbows. Biopsy showed it was an allergic reaction to the medication as atopic dermatitis with eosinophils. The medical data sheet for the medication shows that the number one allergic reaction is a rash and if that happens to discontinue the medication. \n\nThe only problem is, I have tried other sodium alginate alternatives and none work. Neither do PPIs and h2 antagonists and all other acid reflux meds Ive been prescribed over the years.

Can this progress from a skin rash to a more immediate serious reaction? What damage am I doing to my body by continuing to take the meds? What can I do to mitigate the damage?'"

Thank you\n\nI\'m not sure if this is the right thing for me to do or not, but I\'m so tired. I\'m tired of waiting. Tired of not getting any real answers. Tired of being sick. Tired of being in pain. Most of all, I\'m tired of being tired. I called off work today...again. This seems to be a monthly thing these days. Anyhow, since I was 17 I have suffered from chronic migraine with aura. I am now 38 and it wasn\'t until about 2 or 3 years ago that I was finally approved for a monthly injection. That injection has been a lifesaver, but that only alleviates one of my problems, and these symptoms all may very well not be linked to each other, I don\'t know. I\'m just a pharmacy technician, I compound the meds that treat the medically affected.\n\nWhen I was 19 or 20 I was in a terrible accident where I fell out of a car and hit my head on the road at an estimated 45mph. It didn\'t knock me out, but it sure did mess me up. I was dizzy, saw stars galore, and my head was split clean open at the crown on the left side. My skull was fine, but I did have to be stitched up and what not. This hospital said that my CT came back fine, but this hospital is also notorious for killing people by misdiagnosis, but that\'s neither here nor there.\nAnyhow, I haven\'t had my brain looked at since. Fast forward a few years, 24 years old and find out that I have a heart murmur. Say what?! Took them a few years of different doctors having different opinions until they finally decided to do a TEE (heart scope for those who don\'t know) that they were able to finally verify that I have a fused aorta, so it\'s a bileaflet rather than a trileaflet. I also have mild to moderate mitral regurgitation along with a moderate amount of ectopic heartbeats. I have genetically gained my father\'s wonderful high cholesterol, but that\'s also been known since I was 24.\nI gotta take it back a second, though. When I was younger, like 12ish 14ish, I started experiencing pain in my lower back like you wouldn\'t believe and sometimes I would get pain that would like a knife in my ass cheek. Sometimes it would happen on just one side, sometimes both, and sometimes it would be so bad that I would fall because my leg gave out. It was awful. My dad took me to the doctor, they didn\'t scan me and just said it was likely tight muscles and gave me some stretches and exercises to do. Those made it worse, soooo much worse. Not to mention, around the age of 14 or 15, I had hurt my back twice. One was because a little kid accidentally interlocked his roller skate with mine and it flipped me up in the air and then straight down on my tailbone. Had to have been at least a 3 foot drop straight onto my ass bones, not fun. The bruise was insane. The second was a car accident. My dad and I were stopped at a red light on a busy highway. We had cars beside us and in front of us, but nobody behind us until some drunk or whatever decided to not even try to stop and hit us at an estimated 60 or 65 mph. We were okay, thank God. It messed dude\'s truck up more than our car, but the whiplash was unreal. Still no scans, just offered a foam brace.\nMoving on to when I was 18, I was in a bad car accident. The fact that I had my seat belt on and was driving 4 door car is the only reason I am still here is what I was told. I got out on my own, but was in complete shock and didn\'t know what was going on. I only had a tiny cut on my finger, but my neck hurt something terrible. I was able to move it and all that, so they didn\'t scan me and wrote me off work for a week for severe whiplash.\nAt 19 or 20 is when I hit my head on the road. At 24 I found out about my heart and also received some x-rays at a chiropractor. I was told that I had 5 vertebrae out and a disc in my neck that is ""roughly 80% deteriorated"" and I was shown on the x-rays where my neck is actually starting to curve the opposite direction, and I was also asked if I had ever injured my tailbone because there looks to be a possible old fracture. Well, gee, I wonder why So, I went to the chiropractor for a while, it helped with what he said was sciatica (the pain in my ass cheek and leg that would drop me to the floor), but it hurt so bad when he would crack my neck and I was terrified that I would end up getting hurt rather than helped, so I stopped going and those were the last images taken of my neck and back aside from a future MRI for a possible PE, but that will be talked about a little further into this. At 25, I had my twins  During my pregnancy, I had a VERY weird episode where I had double vision with extreme pain in my eyes for about 30 seconds, but my eyes looked normal according to the person that I was with. It was awful, and so scary, but I ignored it thinking it was just something to do with my migraines and pregnancy. Well, it has now happened around a handful of times in total. One of those times I finally said something to my eye doctor after an incredibly painful episode (worst instance so far) a few years ago. I was told that it was just my migraines and it is no problem and that it isn\'t harmful  I\'ve also reported a tightness or Charley horse like feeling in my ribs if I bend down too far or move in a funny position. It\'s like a Charley horse that lasts just a few seconds to sometimes minutes if I can\'t reposition or move a different way to make it go away. That\'s been a thing since I was at least in my mid to late teens. I\'ve never really gotten a response out of a doctor about that feeling. \nI have since then experienced tingling and numbness in my fingers and nose/lips which has worsened either in frequency, length, or pain. The nose/lips tingling and numbness comes and goes. Along with all of that are now the added symptoms of spasticity, and deep, electric, pulsating like pain in my legs. Sudden onset of what has been diagnosed as IBS was diagnosed some 5 years ago or so. Severe depression and mood swings within the past 3 years. About a year ago I woke with this pain in my chest, but I still went to work. It was said be a pleurisy like feeling. I can\'t even explain it, but my director walked me up to the ER to get checked out. Well, they did a blood draw for d-dimer, it came back positive. So, to the MRI I go, no pulmonary embolism (THANK HEAVENS), and it\'s just chalked up to a pulled muscle in or around my diaphragm. That lasted about 5 days in total with the pain easing daily with steroids.\nBring on the heat, bring on the itching and swelling. But omg, the itching  My legs would itch and I couldn\'t help but scratch and I would bleed. I couldn\'t escape the hives all last summer, so I\'m really dreading this summer. Since then I have found out that I have elevated CCP antibodies and a vitamin d insufficiency, but no other indication of an autoimmune disease. I have been able to get my vitamin d to come up a little to put me within normal range, but it\'s still not great  I was told that there is the possibility of rheumatoid-arthritis in my future. I have always been the girl that has sweat more than the other girls, but I can\'t explain how much worse it is now. I have hyperhydrosis of my face and head, and now my hands and feet. I can\'t sleep at night because I can\'t regulate my temperature. I\'m either freezing or wake up hot and soaking wet from sweat. If it\'s cold outside, it hurts like needles all over my body and it feels like my body is misfiring in a way. If it\'s hot outside, I can\'t stop the sweating, the headaches, the lightheaded feeling, and I can\'t seem to get enough water. Not to mention what the heat does to my skin  Over the past 8 months or so, I\'ve had bouts of feeling like the floor was moving underneath me or I was on a boat just swaying back and forth. Only lasts for a few seconds when it does happen. I often get lightheaded when I stand, but my blood pressure is fine. I have been given a diagnosis of central pain syndrome, fibromyalgia, and possible piriformis syndrome. I was also told that there is the possibility of small fiber neuropathy, but the EMG read normal and the biopsy came back within normal range, but I was told that 95% of the population has denser tissue than I do and that COULD be why I am suffering from the neuropathic symptoms along with an autonomic dysfunction, which would also explain my sudden onset of a hot flash followed by nausea and sometimes vomiting if I can\'t get it under control followed by shivering cold and goosebumps that I forgot to mention earlier in my timeline. So, I should probably mention that I\'ve also been tested for menopause twice now and the tests came back negative. Anyhow, I finally felt defeated in that moment and just started crying. The doctor asked why I want scans, I tell her that I\'m afraid that there is damage to my spine or brain and I can\'t figure out why after all of the trauma I\'ve suffered nobody will actually work hard enough to get the approval for a brain and cervical spine MRI with contrast. I know something is wrong, I just don\'t know what to do at this point and I\'m desperate for answers for not only myself, but my children as well. She just looked at me like a dog with it\'s head cocked sideways. Can anybody give me any ideas as to what they think could be wrong? Please help me '"

From CT state.'","b' Hello. My story of how I ended up in this situation is so long that I could not easily tell it in full with the time I have. But in short, I was put on medications for schizoaffective disorder because I told my school that my sister molested me. My parents instantly jumped to the conclusion that I had to have been delusional for thinking that my sister could\'ve ever done something like that, and told my psychiatrist to put me on meds for schizoaffective/schizophrenia disorder. He committed heavy malpractice and for the longest time didn\'t even tell me what I was diagnosed with, didn\'t even tell me the side effects of the medication, or the name of it.\n\nLong story short, three years later I am on new medications. I was involuntarily sent to a psych ward for trying to file a police report. It was living hell, where no one listened to me or cared for me, and the doctor told me I would be out of there sooner if I started taking injected palipiderone. Then he told me that my stay would be extended. The people in the ward told me that I was delusional and refused to even look at the evidence I had on my phone of my sister literally admitting to a lot of it. I was actually supposed to see a lawyer the day after I was hospitalized. Then he told me that no time would\'ve changed regardless of what meds I took. I heard a lot of stories from other people in the ward about how he did things similar to this and always acted erratic like that. The new meds are horrible, and my new doctor likely will not listen to me if I tell him to take them off. I cannot tell my parents to change the doctor, they are extremely neglectful and will not listen to me. Their only instinct is ""listen to the doctor"" but he never listens to me or believes what I have to say.\n\nI am just wondering if I can just not give my consent to see this doctor without being threatened reasonably by hospitalization, and more importantly can I ask that he taper me off of them?

A few days ago she started to experience a fast-spreading rash along with swelling of her hands and face (itchy and painful). The rash started on her hand and arm then started again on her torso. It's since spread to her legs, neck and forehead. \n\nShe went to Urgent Care yesterday and then the ER; ER ran some tests (COVID- she's still +; chest xray and CT- no PE; labs- D-Dimer of 1.57?), they prescribed her an inhaler, advised her to take Benadryl and follow up with her provider in a week or two. Other than that they didn't communicate squat to her, didn't go over any of the test results with her, and seemed completely unconcerned about the swelling. Since then, even with the Benadryl the swelling and rash have continued to progress. It's crazy, her face looks almost cartoonish now. It's bad. Her eyes are almost swollen shut and I have no idea what to do. She's trying to set an an appointment with the family provider, but until then- Where the hell do we go? Different hospital ER? Should we try the same one and roll the dice that we get different staff? Is the swelling not that unusual for COVID? I'm worried as hell.\n\nEdit: Allergic reaction is ruled out as far as we know, she hasn't been exposed to anything new. We have health insurance. She's been taking ibuprofin and mucinex.

Additionally I would experience some ear pain & pressure. I've always been sensitive to sounds, especially at night and need quite  to sleep. The sound was primarly in the right ear.\n\nWent to the doctor she said might be due to sinuses being blocked/stuffy nose. Took some meds for blocked sinuses to no avail. Went to ear, nose throat specialist and he said ears look fine (no infection etc...) and that tinnitus can just happen. He also mentioned might be due to stiff muscles around neck and face.\n\nSleeping had been okay since I could just sleep on my left ear and not hear anything. Christmas time it was almost unnoticeable to the point where I don't recall being worried or impacted by it. This lasted up until mid January when I would sometimes hear it in my left ear as well. Beginning of Feb it got worse and I would hear the sound in a very high pitched - this lasted 1.5 weeks and it  was bad. Bad sleep quality & headaches. I've been focusing on relaxing my muscles with cream, massage appointments and baths. Interestingly when I took a hot bath with muscles oils I saw major temporary improvement. That night  I slept very well and barely heard the noise at all. The noise returned however less intense as before. To note massagists have always noted that my muscles are very tense - also stems from depression background.\n\nAnother point I want to note is that the noise is sometimes gone and comes back, for example it feels worse at night or later in the day and when I wake up its either very weak or gone in both ears. Curently it is barebly - only hear it when I really focus on it, wear headphones without music or try and sleep on one ear.\n\nMy doctors and family friends who are medical professionals have told me Tinnitus is very difficult to tackle as it can stem from a multitude of reasons. I am just looking for any other opinions or maybe tips I could try to stem or even relieve myself of this noise forever. This has taken quite the toll on my mental health as I have taken care of my ears - barely party, wear earplugs and do not quite accept that this is now chronic and I have to live with it from now on.\n\nThank you for your help & time."""

She needs an MRI of both her cervical and thoracic spine in order to see the infections and the hardware. She needs to be fully sedated and intubated for the MRI because she can\'t lay still for the required length of time for the imaging due to pain, she is also claustrophobic, and has PTSD. The MRI also needs to be with contrast and without contrast. She just found out that her doctors haven\'t even ordered her an MRI despite obvious swelling at her surgery site from January 30/31 2023.\n\nIf she goes the ER and gets admitted surgery will probably happen. This is a problem because if she is not at home for 30 days she looses her electric wheel chair, as stated by her Medicare or medicaid agreement. If she is in the hospital for more than 6 weeks her SSI and disability will be sent to the hospital. Without her income she can\'t pay for her house or her bills. Filing happens every 6 months, not whenever it\'s needed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe history:\n\nMy cousin has had 5 spinal fusions over like the last 12 years. 3 in her cervical spine (it had to be redone twice), the majority of her Thoracic spine was fused in March 2020, and her lumbar spine. Her lumbar spine is the only one that hasn\'t failed. \n\nOver labor day weekend 2022 my cousin went to an ER due to unbearable pain and a fever. They did tests which were all inconclusive and they messed up her medication regiment. \n\nMy cousin then goes to a different ER a day or two agreed getting home from the other one.  They found out she had acute renal failure (never had kidney trouble before) and that she had 2 abscesses on her spine and put her on IV antibiotics. \n\nCome November/December 2023 she was working with a team in Denver. They had a huge plan in place to open her up, remove the infected hardware, flush out the infection every few weeks, replace the hardware, and then align her spine meticulously. They had precise angles for where each of her vertebrae would go. This was going to take months, have a dedicated surgical team, and then several months of recovery.  \n\nHowever, that got upended when my cousin became numb from under her breasts and downward. She was taken to the ER in Denver. They did an MRI and then sent her straight to surgery. Part of her cervical spine had collapsed and was pinching her nerves. The surgery was successful in restoring her nerves and her hardware was replaced and part of the infection was removed. She was fitted for a custom brace for her neck, a new pic line, and they got her set up with in home physical and occupational therapy since she couldn\'t go to rehab because she would lose her benefits and because she is adrenal deficient. She would more than likely pick up an infection there while recovering and fighting her already existing infection. All was going well, my cousin had regained movement that she had lost after her thoracic fusion, and had feeling back in her lower body and extremities.\n\nThroughout checkups to see how healing was going she ended up with another infected pic line and her incision sight had also become infected and swollen. The pic line was removed. She no longer has to wear her brace, but she has once again lost certain motor skills and her pain is back and increasing. Which brings us to now and the problems explained above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore history:\n\nMy cousin was treated for at least 10 years for rheumatoid arthritis. Turns out she doesn\'t and never has had rheumatoid arthritis. I know treatment involved pills, injections, steroids, and other forms of treatment.  She has had issues with her feet consistently breaking, that was solved and now she has special orthopedic shoes that prevent her feet from moving in such a way that causes them to break.\n\nHer son, 23M, lives with her and helps in her care. He is informed and familiar with her history and meds. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nApologies for any grammatical errors, or if this is hard to follow. I know it\'s a lot. It\'s over whelming to me.

About a year ago, when the pandemic ended and I went back to in-person school, I noticed severe cognitive deficits. Mainly in focus, attention, and thinking speed. My parents didnt believe what I was describing was a real problem, and after months of fighting, I convinced them to make an appointment with my psychiatrist. He said that it seemed I might have ADHD, and prescribed a very LOW dose stimulant. Upon taking it for a few days/weeks, I noticed not only an improvement in my cognitive issues, but also in my ocd and general quality of life, which has been rather poor for the last few years. \n\nMy parents were not happy with the medication from the biggin. They started out arguing it was bad because of how much weight I lost (a few kilos), however, I described that the weight loss was getting better, and was likely due to something else (which I will describe in a bit). However, these rational arguments against the medication quickly evolved into full-blow made up paranoia. They began straight up making upside effects, from insomnia (which I didnt have), and my hands being shacky (which is a problem Ive alyise had, and is a result of the biology of OCD). Yet their biggest paranoid concern was becoming an addict. They on multiple occasions said I would become a heroin, meth cocain, etc addict. This constant fighting led to them refusing to ask my doctor to raise the dose when I described I thought we should. Because of this, I raised the dose on my own, which only helped reinforce their drug addict delusions. I also went for a neuro psych test, a multi hour diagnostic test, which although confirmed a lot of the issues I described having, stated I likely didnt have clinical ADHD. Regardless, the next appointment I had with my doctor, we (me and hime, as my parents were opposed to it decided to continue giving it a try because of the benefit I stated, however, we didnt increase the dose.\n At the beginning of the summer, I went to a residential treatment facility(which was planned science the cognitive issue started, but was delayed until the summer). Despite the OCD not really having much of an effect on me, I agreed to go because I hoped they would be willing to be more aggressive with the medication, however not only did they not increase the dose, but they took me off the Adderall. I was there for a total of 5 weeks, which was pure hell. THey took me off it with about 2 weeks left, due to the fact I didnt have clinical adhd, and needless to say my misserly over there increased exponentially. When I got home and had a meeting with my own doctor, he said to keep me off it, and to have a nother meating after 2 months, to see how school goes.\n\n It is now the day before that appointment, and I have been living in absolut misery for more than 3-4 months. All the symptoms improved got worse again, and I am in a deep state of misery. My only real hope now is to get put back on the medication tomorrow, however my parents refuse to even discuss this, and end up just yelling at me, calling me an addict. I need your help with ideas on how to try getting back on the medication. What can I do or say to try convincing my doctor that I was actually helped massively by it, and have gotten much worse after getting off it, as opposed to my parents constantly saying im just doing this to get drugs. Im honestly not sure what I can do if my doctor also refuses to put me back on, or if my parents simply refuse to pick up the prescription. Any help would be really helpful.\n\nFyi the appointment is online, where Im with my parents on a couch with the doctor in a zoom call'"

Why do they automatically assume this.',"b'29 female 5\'8 115 pounds. Health issues diagnosed are Potts and vasculitis as well as hypothyroidism. \n\nAlmost everytime I go to the doctor for these health issues stated above, or sometimes to change treatment plan (like gettjng new meds) they always mark that I\'m anxious in my notes (I use an online portal and can see these notes). It annoys me to no end that they assume how I feel. I haven\'t felt anxious a SINGLE time going to the doctor since  2009. I don\'t understand why they\'d make this observation when Im  acting, well,...  normal? Unless this is a regular thing they do to all patients but uh\n\nIs this a sexism thing? It annoys me because I know a lot of people (especially women) who get shit medical care or even end up dying because they\'re diagnosed or said to have ""anxiety"", and a few of my friends being victims of this, it just angers me.\n\n I\'ve experienced this myself too actually. Back in 2015, I kept going back to the hospital for severe pain. Turns out I had an ovarian cyst rupture, but they just diagnosed me with anxiety and acid reflux 3 times before actually doing anything. I thought after this experience I would never see a doctor again due to the inhumane treatment I got there (they started treating me rudely until they saw the ovarian cyst burst on imaging and proved them wrong)  sadly I went on to develop the 3 health issues stated above since then tho and I chose to continue care for them due to the pain.\n\nBut it just makes me not even want to continue care because even my Potts was said to be ""just anxiety"" at first as well. When new symtpoms now occur, I feel like I won\'t be listened to. \n\nLately I\'ve been getting a lot worse. Not leaving bed due to leg pain, bloody stool, pissing in a bucket in my room due to shortness of breath and heart palpitations(bathroom is upstairs), sleeping 15 or more hours (due to severe fatigue), not eating or drinking etc. I dont even want to go back to the doctors if all they\'re going to say ""it\'s anxiety"". I feel way too tired to fight off anyone rude or dismissive. Idk if there\'s another way around that. I just refuse to get assertive when I\'m so tired and exhausted. \n\nI was wondering how common this treatment is and why doctors mark down someone as anxious even when you are numb asf.'"

The imaging outlined in detail below has found no remarkable difference between my SCMs except for slight atrophy of the right - no fat marbling is present and the nerve conduction study was unremarkable.

Doctors cannot locate the cause, and I am scared and alone. Any intuitions/comments are welcome.'","b""So long story short, until Oct 2022 I was a healthy slightly obese 27 years old male.  \n\n\nOne day, all of a sudden, trouble breathing, sharp muscle pain in left shoulder, and tachycardia. Hospital did a CT scan and an XRAY and told me I have a PE. Was hospitalized for 5 days for injections, an ultrasound on my legs(check for DVT) , CT scan, and blood work all came back clean, so I was good to go. Took some blood to run thrombophilia tests but since I was already on medication for clotting they said it was not gonna be very accurate. Left with Xarelto and Nexium for 4 months.   \n\n\nThe first month after exiting the hospital was **THE WORST** of my life. Googling and searching 24/7 what may have caused my PE, along with digestive issues. Slight fever, nausea without vomiting, diarrhea, and complete loss of appetite. If there is a disease that can kill you out there, for a moment I thought I had it(middle finger to WebMD). Pancreatic, colon, lung, thyroid, and liver cancer? You bet. HIV, hepatitis c  maybe? Why not.  \nI run after doctors for a month and did almost every medical test in the books: Colonoscopy, EGD, lower abdomen CT scan, colon MRI to test for Crohn's or IBD.  \nAll came back clean expect a slight swelling they found on my colon, which was said to be an infection. yet biopsies came out clean too.   \nExpect appetite loss I still have to this day, all other digestive issues were gone.  \n\n\n4 months later, another CT scan, heart function tests, and blood tests, all came clean. So pulmonalogist said: you can stop Xarelto but after you do, please go to repeat the thrombophylia test, because if you do have a blood clotting disorder, you will have to resume taking it.    \n\n\nWell this is where I screwed up. I didn't go for that test since I thought that the whole thing was over and I was healthy again. **BIG MISTAKE**  \n\n\nApproximately 2 months after stoping Xarelto, another PE. Slighter symptoms this time, but again hospitalized for days, and this time Eluiqis for life. Thankfully this time they took blood before they started treatment and sent it for thrombophilia testing.   \n\n\nThe results are not showing something that directly links me to a known syndrome, according to the hematologist I visited and now she wants me to do another colonoscopy to check my colon for infections.  \n\n\nThat's pretty much it. All doctors say that the chance of cancer(my biggest fear) is very small, and though all my tests came back clean, I am still scared.   \n\n\nIs there anyone here, as a doctor or patient that has seen any similar cases? Unprovoked pulmonary embolisms, no DVT's found, no obvious cancer indicators, no nothing. Just pure clotting straight in my lunds. Please share you opinions/comments or intuitions on this. All are welcome and thank you in advance for taking the time to read this."""

Help Interpreting Lab Results and Symptoms (Suspected Acute Intermittent Porphyria)',"b""Hi there,\n\nI'd like some feedback on lab results I received as I have been unable to reach my nurse practitioner yet and she admits she is not very familiar with cases of what we suspect I might have.\n\nAge: 29\n\nSex: F\n\nWeight: 150lbs\n\nHeight: 5'5\n\nI exercise \\~5x/week and keep a mostly vegetarian diet.\n\nMedications: drospirenone-ethinyl estradiol 3-0.02 mg once daily, Adderall 10mg twice daily, Zyrtec once daily **for management of symptoms described below.**\n\nSupplements: Iron + vit C (Sometimes daily but I am bad at taking it consistently)\n\nSymptoms: Acute reactions after eating, but only sometimes, and not after any particular foods. Reactions include severe lower abdominal cramping, hives and itchiness (usually concentrated on wrists, neck, and around mouth), elevated heart rate, sweating, sometimes itchy throat, sometimes nausea. I have kept a food journal and there are no foods that seem to trigger it - there are foods I eat all the time that will set me off randomly and then I can eat them after with no problem. I have been to an allergist who did a full allergy panel and found no allergies. Three most severe episodes were triggered by an apple,  some veg tacos on corn tortillas, and some trader joes soy curls, respectively. Episodes last around 15min-1 hr and have been occurring for almost 3 years. Anecdotally, they occur more often when I am at social events and also the day after alcohol consumption, though many episodes have occurred with neither of those circumstances. Symptoms become less frequent and less severe when I am taking antihistamines regularly. When I am not taking them, symptoms reliably occur a few times a week, but typically pretty mildly. Most severe episodes have included very debilitating cramps (can't move much), full body hives, light swelling of lips and throat. \n\nI have been to a GI office where the nurse practitioner suggested testing to rule out Acute Intermittent Porphyria. I also had a colonoscopy, which came back normal. \n\nResults of first AIP urine screening were:\n\nPBG/Creatinine Ratio: 2.9 mg/g Creat. (reference interval 0.2-2.2 mg/g)\n\nnote: I had not had an episode for a while (around a month) before this lab, because I had been taking lots of antihistamines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNP called and confirmed these levels were somewhat high and warranted further testing, preferably during an episode when my levels should spike.

Mostly a dull ache with some decreased range in motion. Usually worse after activity especially with a lot of lateral movement. Football for example. Hiking long distances sometimes does it as well but usually not as bad. Oddly sometimes walking and mild activity helps reduce the swelling and pain.\n\nDue to a few factors including the pandemic, depression, and this issue I stopped running all together. \n\nI plan to follow up with a specialist as soon as I can get an appointment and find a new primary physician.\n\nIn the meantime my question is whether I can resume running (presumably short distances)?\n\nHeres the specialist notes:\n\nImaging Studies: 5/29/18 WB L ankle: mild ball and socket ankle joint.  Intact mortise and syndesmosis.  No arthritis, though there may be a small cyst in the lateral plafond on the AP view.  No coalition seen in the hindfoot.\n \nAssessment: Left ankle pain\n \nPlan:  We discussed that the side to side motion in the foot is about half of the other side. We also see a bit of a ""ball and socket"" ankle joint.  This suggests the as the ankle developed before growth was done, the hindfoot joints were unable to dissipate the side to side forces in life so that ankle actually developed a bit abnormally in order to help handle these forces.  An injury to the growth plate could potentially produce a similar appearance on xray.  It is possible that some of the symptoms could be coming from there peroneal tendons, though they are working well on exam and it seems like the pain is deeper, on the back outside of the ankle.  Another consideration would be posterior impingement, such as from an os trigonum or posterior process talus, but I don\'t see this on xray.\n           The most common cause of this lack of motion would be a tarsal coalition, though I don\'t see this on the ankle xrays. We should check foot xrays as well today.\n           I would take NSAIDs (motrin, aleve) as needed, perhaps prior to activities that lead to symptoms. Use of an ankle brace can be helpful.  I would avoid side to side cutting sports, and instead stick with low impact in-line things.\n           If they symptoms are bad enough to consider surgery, I would get an MRI to better evaluate the joints and tendons.'"

Sorry. \nI am officially desperate. I (25F) have had mystery joint pain for 12 years now and I feel like Im dying. \n\nMy main problems have been in joints, starting with my right knee and gaining a new problem joint every year or so. They get inflamed and incredibly painful. My knees, wrists, hands, and feet all have problems. Ive seen a million specialists, had every test/imaging/physical therapy/medication/special diet and nothing has helped or given answers. If one more person suggests gLuTen fReE I will keel over. I would have noticed a difference during Auto Immune Paleo, I promise. \n\nThe only diagnosis Ive gotten is chronic Lyme disease at 16/17yo, which I believe was BS as Ive never tested positive for Lyme or had the bullseye. I was on antibiotics for a year which did nothing good, plus every other specialist I spoke to thought the guy was a quack. A Childrens Hospital rheumatologist gave me biologics (Enbrel, Humira, Methotrexate) which also did nothing. Steroids used to help with inflammation but dont do much for me now. \n\nMy newest and biggest problem is my jaw, which started giving me pain in July 2022. It feels like its being pulled to (my) left side, and its incredibly painful on the right. It gives me a cross bite, an over bite, and a little bit of swelling on the right side. I cannot chew effectively so I just mash things around with my tongue. Ive been living on potatoes, soup (mainly without meat) and pasta. Most of this food is now completely revolting to me (I tapped out on protein shakes after the first few months). I went from 155lbs to 118 between July22 - January23, now back up to 125. I cannot sleep comfortably as its very painful in any position. CT scan shows nothing.\n\nSymptoms/History:\n\nEverything feels wound too tight. Its like the opposite of double jointed; I just cant stretch without serious pain. I have always been this way. It was chalked up to laziness and growing pain in elementary school. I have touched my toes maybe twice in my life and this was not for lack of trying. \nMy toes curl under, my legs dont like to lay flat, I have pain in my achilles/calves which I now think is the main cause of my knee pain as its always in synch. \n\nI cant run whatsoever without getting cramps in my torso. I was recently told by a chiropractor (sue me, Im desperate) that it was probably my fascia being too tight/stiff. He also suggested that my temporal muscles were abnormally pulling on my jaw. \n\nI get random, bright red hot spots that form suddenly.  Mainly on my joints but also my ears, like one ear at a time??? They come and go quickly and dont hurt. \n\nI am incredibly prone to canker sores. I cannot take NSAIDs due to this. I had multiple diagnosed stomach ulcers in high school. \n\nBowel problems - I just know this has something to do with my gut. I used to pass a lot of blood, but testing and colonoscopy at the peak of these symptoms turned up nothing. My grandfather had Chrons, but consistent testing for bowel diseases still shows nothing for me. I have been taking new probiotics for a year which has solved my gut problems (god bless seed.com) but when I stop the symptoms return with vengeance.\nIve had nausea problems for like 8 years which seem to have no triggers, I still take Zophran for this maybe 3-4 times a month when its bad.\n\nI started getting migraines about 4 years ago. I have a Complex Migraine diagnosis that mainly manifests as cognitive problems like slurred speech, disorientation, tunnel vision, etc. \nI take Nortriptyline 40mg which has mostly solved this. I do get some headaches that are usually triggered by heat. Ive done 2 sleep studies which showed I do not grind my teeth or clench my jaw to cause tension headaches. Dentists also agree I don\'t grind my teeth.\n\nI am a chronic insomniac. My preschool teachers just let me color while other kids napped. I was diagnosed with ADHD last year, I tried every medication under the sun from Jan - September, I got no assistance from them and now I have restless leg syndrome (:\n\n\n\nDoctors have said for the past 5ish years that I probably have some kind of ""undiscovered"" condition, which is probably true but unhelpful. The only suggestion for my jaw is to get Botox for TMJ, but that would be about $3,000 just to try. Insurance will only help cover it if it\'s done by an Otolaryngologist and none within a 300 mile radius of me do Botox. \nI am withering away. I am constantly angry, feel like crying 24/7, and would simply like to crawl under a rock and die. I\'m sure I need therapy but that\'s money I don\'t have on top of my usual medical expenses. I\'m not looking for a miracle diagnosis or a cure, just any suggestions to help with my jaw symptoms, thanks.'"

Not on any medication right now other than over the counter as needed ibuprofen and heart burn medications\n\nIt comes and goes with no real reason or pattern as far as cause. Usually my index or middle fingers, right or left hand. I dont get numbness or tingling before it happens. They hurt mainly from the pressure that occurs but it's pretty mild and I don't take anything for it. I haven't noticed if it happens after exposure to a virus, or any other sickness.\n\nI get small bumps that swell with clear fluid and I've never NOT popped them so I don't know what happens if left alone. I have some unrelated sensory issues, and texture changes on my skin are a big thing. So I tend to pop them asap, that said they constantly refill with fluid. Usually atleast for another day or 2. Sometimes they get irritated sometimes they don't. I express them often as again I can't stand the sensation\n\nOnce the fluid filling stage ends they dry up and sometimes get crusty or dry. They leave crater like scabs/dry patches that take weeks to resolve. I pick at them and probably make it last longer, but again sensory issues.\n\nWhen they start they happen in clusters, sometimes touching sometimes not. Usually within the same square inch or so on my finger. They don't cause my finger to swell or change color. The area around the bumps may get red sometimes but not every time. Never have I had puss or blood in them. They are Usually around or near a knuckle joint, not my cuticles.\n\nI've previously mentioned this to a Dr, but it's never happened in time to have them see it.

Pain is getting unbearable. Is something being missed? 28M, 5\'8"" / 140 lbs, non-smoker.'","b'I\'m a generally healthy 28-year-old medical resident. After a long time of not really exercising, I decided to pick up running about 8 months ago, nothing too intense, never really more than 1.5 miles at a time and never felt particularly fatigued, but did become out of breath during numerous times and in retrospect was probably using accessory muscles as a result. One day, I woke up with a strange left-sided chest pain that I noticed immediately seemed localized, somewhere above my second or their rib laterally, and would hurt when pressed. This made me think of costochondritis (though the pain is more lateral than costo would typically present) and I figured there wasn\'t much to do for it other than rest and OTC pain meds. I let it be for some time but then months went by and it kept getting worse. I noticed that particular movements and positions would exacerbate the pain, for example, laterally bending to the right, twisting my body toward the right side, elevating myself with my shoulders coming from a laying flat position, etc. **Importantly -- I am able to ""crack"" my chest, multiple times a day, often multiple cracks at a time coming from different areas in my chest, sometimes even to the right of my sternum, which immediately alleviates some of the pain. At its worst, the pain is present at or near the apex of a breath.** I proceeded to ask for a work-up, which has thus far been as follows:\n\n1. Normal CXR. Recommended to utilize variety of pain interventions such as lidocaine gel, diclofenac gel, naproxen, ibuprofen. Nothing worked to alleviate the pain fully. Naproxen most effective in taking the edge off but never fully gone no matter what dose I take. At some point I was also given a steroid cream which was likewise not effective.\n2. Referred to a DO for manual therapy, who noticed that my left scapula seemed to be hyper mobile and that my left ribcage appears to be jutting out slightly. I was not aware of this previously but there\'s a good chance it was like this before the injury and I just never paid attention as it\'s pretty subtle. Not sure. Manual therapy (x2 sessions) ineffective. Discussed PT vs further imaging vs steroid or saline injection. Decided on PT to start with.\n3. Started PT, who noted that there was some degree of asymmetry in terms of muscle tone, with weaker muscles in my left shoulder and back. Given exercises, which upon starting exacerbated the pain pretty significantly. I have a high pain tolerance so I\'m continuing along with all my residency responsibilities but given the escalating pain I requested further imaging.\n4. Normal MRI that imaged lateral left chest, shoulder, and back with regard to muscle tone and symmetry. I was also prescribed gabapentin in the event that there is a component of neurological pain, currently up to 300 mg TID which has made absolutely no difference.\n\nI am currently continuing PT with more exercises but the pain is getting to the point where it is simply intolerable. I\'ve had a kidney stone and several corneal abrasions due to anterior basement membrane dystrophy so I am no stranger to pain, but coupled with my escalating residency responsibilities, I simply can\'t continue like this without something giving way. The diagnosis of scapulas dyskinesia is unsatisfying to me and I think something is being missed considering the degree of pain. My residency insurance is shitty and though I considered a referral to Mayo (I am based in MN), I simply can\'t afford it with the deductible for out-of-network services being what it is. Any insight would be much appreciated -- thank you!'"

The full progression can be seen here. Apologies in advance, some of the images could only be uploaded as short videos from my iphone, sorry about that. https://imgur.com/a/PCMGzVW\nI had indeed broken my toe. I went to urgent care and they recommend the standard thing - buddy tape, firm shoes, return to activity when it doesnt hurt. Which is exactly what I did. It seemed to be healing quite well (as can be seen in the album) until the middle of week 3 when it suddenly starting feeling worse.\n\nI had been flexing my toe one evening and I worry I may have refractured it somehow. Afterwards the pain got worse in the following week, I felt a strange clicking sensation sometimes (not painful) and I felt like I was regressing. I went to urgent care again and I was basically told the exact same thing, except now they recommended me wearing an orthopedic boot with an inflexible sole. Once I could wear normal shoes again, I should do that and go for a ""tough walk"" as long as I dont experience pain during the walk.\n\nSo I did that, I got a post-op shoe and wore that, still felt like my toe was moving around though because the inside of the shoe had padding. At this point I had been taping and untaping my toes for 6 weeks and they starting having a reaction to the tape and all my toes starting getting some swelling. I switched to using vetwrap with some gauze for comfort and I got a carbon fiber insert and a very wide toe box minimalist shoe - which basically made the shoe unable to bend.\n\nSince then I feel like I\'ve stagnated and becoming more and more frustrated. When to my pcp a few days ago who said yea this isn\'t normal, I\'m referring to you to a podiatrist.\n\nI am an avid walker and hiker and my job requires me to be on my feet a lot. I have however, not walked on my toe when it feels painful and I can walk around barefoot without any discomfort.

However, I wanted to see if anyone else has had this happen to them and how it turned out?\n\nI am also vaguely suspicious I may have mild raynaud\'s syndrome, I\'ve always had very cold toes and fingers and will regularly get chilblains.

I need to figure out where to go from here.\n\nI also know I have no STDS as I was recently tested and have  had a single partner for 3 years now. Also had a recent pap-smear. All came up as normal according to OBGYN.\n\nAge: 27\n\nSex: Female biologically\n\nHeight: 5""4\n\nWeight: 290 (trying to lose it, hard with hypothyroidism)\n\nDiagnosed conditions: Hypothyroidism, Asthma, adhd, GAD. Possibly PCOS, currently being tested for this. Also, I have been tested for diabetes. I have a slight insulin resistance but not enough to be considered pre-diabetic. Sugar water test done in August 2022.\n\nRace: White\n\nDrink: casually, not much at all.\n\nSmoke: No. And no drug use either.\n\nPrimary complaint:\n\nHas had on and off constant irritation and itching in SPECIFICALLY the bottom right part of my vagina and vulva (Inside and a little out). This has been on and off since taking antibiotics in august 2022 and after intercourse in September 2022. Was treated for yeast infection, all symptoms EXCEPT itching went away. Continued to be treated for yeast infection with a multitude of other symptoms for months including lidocaine for the itching. No one could figure out what it was. I was tested for yeast, vaginosis, UTI and other typical infections for women. None of these worked.\n\nI went in for my yearly in December at my old OBGYN and talked to her about my issues. After examination, she noted my hymen was white. I have some family members with auto immune so she thought possibly lichen sclerosis. She gave me a steroid. The steroid actually worked and made me feel better. A week later I go back for my check up and she says it is no longer white so it is likely not lichen sclerosis. She instructs me to stop the steroid and that she thinks it\'s Vulvodynia. She puts me on the following MIXTURE (yes mixture, I had to go to a special pharmacy) of the following medications in ointment form:\n\nBupivacaine, flurbiprofen, Gabapentin, Lidocaine 2-10-10-5% Lipoderm. Instructions, apply a pea sized amount to area 3-4 times a day.\n\nMy OBGYN retired in December and so I went to my new one last week. Over the past 3 weeks of January, my itching symptoms have increased exponentially since first trying this new medication. I was told by old OBGYN, OBGYN Nurse, and by pharmacist that it WILL burn a little when I put it on. However, now the frequency of needing to use the medication has gone from once a day to 6 times a day and even during the night at 3-5am. I can\'t go longer without it. The medication will get rid of the itch and ease my paint fo ra while but it comes back like an angry horney. Yesterday, I woke up with an ANGRY pain in my vulva/labia. It hurt to touch, to go to the bathroom. Yet, i can\'t stop the medication or I have NO relief.\n\nI tried to call my doctor but all of the nurses have just thrown \'we can see you tomorrow\' or dismissed me just to get me off the phone. Interrupted me every time I tried to explain what happened. I already saw my new OBGYN and told her what happened. All she did was take my blood and do swab samples to test for vaginosis. She did not prescribe me ANYTHING for the relief. I don\'t know what to do. I\'m almost out of this new medication. I tried to call the new doctor to ask if I should go back on the steroid and the nurse just (very irresponsibly in my opinion without asking for any information and interrupting me so I can\'t give it to her) \'stop using the medication that is making it worse and just use the steroid\'. Meanwhile, I am trying to figure out if that is okay with increased symptoms, etc etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt costs me $80 per appointment and I can\'t just take time off that quickly like that.\n\nShould I go back to using this Steroid? Is there some kind of... super obgyn specialist that deals in weird random itching of female genitalia?\n\nI\'ve had MANY doctors including both of my OBGYNS do visual exams of my genitalia. They do not see any bumps, lumps, nothing. Just redness. There\'s no visual indicators of what the heck it could be. And I am so TIRED and frustrated. I just want relief from this irritation and pain. I just want help. I don\'t understand why it\'s so hard to listen to what I\'m saying is wrong with me. I don\'t know what to do. I don\'t really know where to go at this point. I need advice. It doesn\'t sound or look like this is a typical medical case. I don\'t know. I\'m not a doctor but it\'s been months and no one has been able to figure out what is wrong with me and what is causing the issue. I haven\'t had rough sex. I don\'t like anything rough and basically have been without intercourse for 2-3 months now while all this is going on. Please, if anyone can give me advice here, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate edit: \n\nDay 3. Last night I had a break down because I was woken up by chronic pain and itching. Nothing stopped. I took pain killers. I tried lidocaine. I even went back to the steroid. It helped only a little. I literally had a break down from lack of sleep. I haven\'t had more than 4-5 hours for the past 3-5 days.  I\'m exhausted. I\'m tired of the pain. I just want peace again. \n\nMy doctor called and told me I was negative for all major STDS that she tested for and vaginosis. Not a big surprise to me. I already knew that. She also told me I didn\'t have a yeast infection. No surprise again. Then she goes \'I think you might have Vulvadynia\' and then proceeds to explain what that is. Which honestly makes me feel so freaking ignored. I went into her office last week and told her my retired/previous OBGYN thought it was Vulvadynia too and the med she prescribed me made it worse. \n\nMy current OBGYN didn\'t even acknowledge that and went on to explain the medication she\'s prescribing me. It\'s a slight sedative they use to treat depression, irritable bowel and vulvadynia pain. It makes you tired and sleepy apparently. So I am hoping this will fix my sleepless night issues. Putting the steroid on last night I think helped. It wasn\'t immediate pain, but today the irritation is back to being minimal again. So I think the Steroid DOES help, it\'s just not fast acting and immediate like I want. I also have been taking anti-inflammatory ibprofen. I HATE taking that because I read a study saying IBPROFEN can cause chronic pain later in life. But I gotta do what I gotta do for relief. \n\nAt this point, I am basically recording this for any other women who are experiencing these insane symptoms like me might try to work with their doctors on figuring it out sooner. I know that women\'s health has largely been overlooked and understudied. We didn\'t even figure out the clitoral complex existed until \'discovered\' in 2005 by  Helen OConnell.\n\nI\'m hopeful. I think relief might be in sight. We\'ll see. I\'ll update if the medication does work and I\'ll post what it is once I get the prescription from the doctor. \n\n&#x200B;'"
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/136a2sl/unexplained_daily_persistent_tachycardia_other/,b'Unexplained daily persistent tachycardia + other symptoms have me worried please help!',"b'\nIm a 28F with chronic health issues which I usually write-off as no big deal but Im actually getting kinda worried. \n\nSome background: \n\nPMH & meds:\n- Endometriosis with chronic back and pelvic pain x 10 years  (s/p diagnostic lap and excision, now on norethindrone and IUD) \n- MDD (one episode, well controlled on bupropion) \n- Chronic persistent diarrhea and severe stabbing intermittent abdominal pain x 7 years (evaluated by two gastroenterologists who found no reasonable explanation after a colonoscopy/endoscopy and many other diagnostic evaluations. Of course, I was sent away with a diagnosis of IBS possibly exacerbated by my severe endometriosis) \n- On spironolactone for acne\n- Supplements include: fish oil, multivitamin, L-carnitine, myo-inositol, magnesium glycinate in the PM\n\nSo about a month ago, I was seen in the ED (1st ever ED visit) for a persistent moderate headache x10 days, refractory to OTC & Rx medication and more than adequate hydration, in the setting of post-COVID recovery. Head imaging (MRI/MRA) was negative. Labs showed elevated platelets (473), Hgb (16.6), and Hct (50%), slightly elevated neuts (7.8), as well as elevated glucose (122) despite not eating that day. None of this was concerning to the docs. They ruled my headache to be an atypical migraine in the setting of recent covid infection.\n\nDuring triage, I was also found to be persistently tachycardic into the 120s-140s (I didnt feel my heart racing at any point during this time). They initiated a cardiac work up. EKG showed sinus tach with left atrial enlargement and nonspecific ST and T wave abnormality, thyroid labs were wnl, and CXR wasnt done for some reason. Because my primary concern was the headache, I was offered no explanation for my tachycardia aside from the pain from my headache. As someone with chronic pain, I explained that my headache was very manageable and I was not in any significant pain. Again, there was no concern. I was discharged still tachy in the 100s. \n\nObviously I wasnt quite satisfied with my experience. So upon discharge, I began wearing an Apple Watch and discovered that Im persistently tachy in my daily life: averaging 90s-100s and jumping regularly into the 120s-140s at rest, in the 120s-170s during mild/moderate activity, and 80s-90s during sleep. I have ensured that no friends or family share these stats while wearing the same watch  they all have HRs wnl. After presenting this info to my PCP, who confirmed them briefly while in clinic, they ordered a 14-day Zio patch for further evaluation. Results recently came back and were relatively normal aside from the sinus tach and rare SVTs; there were no arrhythmias seen or recommendations for follow up.\n\nNow Im starting to worry. Ill preface with the fact that I am a medical professional which often leads me to assume my symptoms are benign, and lean in to the most likely diagnosis. But recently Ive had this overwhelming feeling that many of my symptoms may be connected. What began as abdominal pain and diarrhea is now also constant fatigue, extreme abdominal bloating (regardless of what or if I eat), persistent nausea and in more recent years, intermittent shortness of breath (negative pulmonary work up), facial flushing, extreme sensitivity to temperature (shivering/teeth-chattering in the cold, profusely sweating in heat), progressive weight gain and facial swelling (Im highly active and eat clean, no change in activity or diet), and now this largely unexplained headache (still there) and tachycardia.\n\nAfter refreshing my memory on the presentation of a carcinoid tumor and carcinoid syndrome, I surprisingly havent been able to get it out of my head or stop reading literature. I know how rare this is and I feel absolutely crazy to be quite honest. Im really in need of guidance on how to move forward.  Is it worth it to bring up with my doctors? If so, how do I best advocate for myself? What diagnostic evaluations should I ask for? I have an electrophysiology appointment coming up, should I even still go? Please feel free to tell me Im crazy and that none of this is connected. Id also love to hear alternative ideas, possible explanations, or other similar experiences. Thanks in advance.'"

Before that I was already tapering off 75mg of quetiapine in October (to be replaced with trazodone but unfortunately it intensified my allergies) and 120mg duloxetine in November. After the ER visit, I was only left on 200mg lamotrigine and 150mg bupropion but because suddenly I started experiencing agitation after taking it I had to quit the last one as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe nausea is unbearable, for an entire month now and nothing has helped it, even metoclopramide and granisetron didn't work. I do also have muscle cramps in my neck/upper back (tizanidine lost its effect), mildly swollen lymph nodes in my neck/face, insomnia, severe headaches, itchy skin right after taking lamotrigine and inability to regulate temperature (cold and sweating at the same time), etc but the nausea is the one that's killing me. A few nights lorazepam took the nausea and muscle cramps down so I could sleep but I didn't want to take any more to risk dependence.

Im at a loss for what could be going on with my leg.\n\nPersonal details: 26 year old female \\[26F\\], approximately 59kg and 5 ft 8 in height, caucasian, don't smoke, don't really drink, not taking any medication. I am from Northern Ireland.\n\nI landed in Tokyo after a 12 hour flight from Rome, and six hours before that I took a 2-3hr flight from Madrid to Rome. Since arriving in Tokyo Ive been experience pain in my left leg. Ive been in Tokyo for about 57 hours.  \n\nThe pain I am experiencing is in a few different parts of my leg:  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Two different parts of my calf. The pain in my calf is sometimes dull or \tpulsing, sometimes pinching. When the pain is more intense it is not super-duper sharp or unbearable, but definitely uncomfortable and a little painful. One of the calf pains seem to be near my vein.  \n \n* The other pain is in the back of my thigh. The pain in the back of my thigh is vertical as though its running down the back of the leg. Sitting on a chair sometimes makes the back of the thigh pain worse.  \n \n* On \tthe bottom of my foot (arch part) it feels as though something has been pulled. This pain is not always there and depends on the position my foot is in. Even though this pain only came after the flight, I was thinking maybe this pain could be to do with an insole \tI have been wearing recently.  \n \n\nThe pains are not always there. They comes and goes. Sometimes a dull pain might be there for a while. Other times I might feel no pain.\n\nCertain positions make the pain worse. Walking today exasperated the pains and discomfort. Sitting on my bum with my legs out or bent up sometimes causes pins and needles in my left foot after a short time. I tried to stretch the left calf with a standing stretch today and it did not feel good. It felt as though something popped in my calf.\n\nOn the flight I did get up maybe 3 or 4 times to walk around the cabin or go to the toilet, as well as wiggling toes under seat often. Other than that I did fall asleep with my legs crossed (lotus style) for about an hour. I took off socks and shoes and wore shorts the entire 12hr flight. On the short flight from Madrid to Rome I didnt take off my shoes/socks. My legs did feel very heavy and achy on the 12hr flight.  \n\nIn terms of symptoms:\n\nI dont have any redness or hotness or swelling in the leg. Just pain.  \n\nI have become very anxious worrying and googling what the problem could be. This led to heightened anxiety which I have struggled to stabilise all day. I have experienced symptom such as rapid heart beat, a little dizziness, very mild chest pain, nausea, gas (burping), difficulty swallowing, and a general sense of uneasiness. In March I had my first ever panic attack(s), and over the last month I have had recurring anxious episodes, for example rapid heart rate, dizziness. So I am somewhat hopeful that these symptoms are just anxiety from worrying about this over the past day or more, and not DVT complications such as pulmonary embolism. However unlike before I was able to steady my nerves, where as today has felt impossible to do so.\n\nI do have large, protruding veins on my legs which I have had since I was a teenager. They have never been formally diagnosed as varicose veins but I have always assumed that is what they are as varicose veins runs in my family.  \n\nI am very hopeful that it is not DVT, however a quick google search of pain in legs after long flight doesnt yield many results other than DVT.\n\nIm wondering if anyone would know what this leg pain could be if its not DVT? Any advice as to what my next steps should be if DVT is suspected (or if something else is suspected)?\n\nI have travel insurance but I believe it only covers emergency treatment. If it is advised that I should seek medical consultation I will investigate the cost to see if this will be possible.  \n\nI would really appreciate any help regarding this so I can either take steps to seek help or try and put this behind me and begin to enjoy the trip.

I\'m 5\'3"" and about 140 lbs, I don\'t drink or smoke, I live on the east coast.\n\nMy medical history begins at age 7, when I received an mri due to inability to fully open one of my eyes. The mri showed a congenital asymmetry of the left lateral ventricle, but otherwise it was normal and the swelling went away after several months and we moved on.\n\nAt 12, I developed exercise induced asthma which was treated with an inhaler for 2 years before quitting sports.\n\nAt 14, I became concussed after two blows to the head a day apart. I quickly developed headaches that turned into migraines, but after a couple months of the concussion treatment plan, a majority of the symptoms improved. The fatigue and headaches lingered, which 6 months later was diagnosed as iron-deficiency anemia caused by menorrhagia which was treated by combo hormonal birth control.\n\nFor 3-4 months I had no symptoms, but the headaches and fatigue started coming back. I also started having severe nausea, vertigo, and palpitations. They reran my iron levels which came back normal. I then began falling and walking into walls with one spraining my knee so bad I needed crutches for a month. A month later, I was diagnosed with POTs and chronic migraines and was referred to cardiology and neurology.\n\nIncreasing salt and fluid intake did not improve symptoms so I was prescribed zofran, fludrocortisone, and midodrine to treat the nausea, low blood pressure, and other symptoms, none of which was very successful. I was on a new headache medication almost every other month, none had any great success with Effexor causing hallucinations and delirium and amitriptyline causing nightmares and worsening insomnia. During this time, I also had an episode of severe abdominal pain which turned out to be a kidney stone. Throughout high school, I had recurrent pinkish red rashes on my neck, jaw, and cheek.\n\nECGs throughout high school showed normal sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia. My cardiologist ran C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, and ANA which all came back normal. My CBC came back with high rbc (5.2 M/cu mm), high platelets (431 k/cu mm), high eosinophils (.56 K/cu mm) and low MCHC (30.9 g/dL). She reran the CBC with a CMP which showed high potassium (5.7 mmol/L), low carbon dioxide (17 mmol/L) and high anion gap 23 mmol/L. The second CBC showed high WBC (13.47 K/cu mm), RBC (5.71 M/cu mm), hematocrit (47.2 %), Platelets (403 K/cu mm), eosinophils (4.6%) and low mchc (30.7 g/dL).\n\nWhen I started college, I was started on concerta which had begun being used off label for POTs, and it worked very well for me with minimal side effects. Everything went smoothly until I got the sick my sophomore year of college, causing such severe abdominal pain I had to be checked for appendicitis. I was told they werent sure what it was, but it wasnt appendicitis. At this point, I was taking concerta, midodrine, fludrocortisone, birth control, topiramate, and gabapentin.\n\nI remained mostly healthy until the fall of 2019, when I started having severe recurrent abdominal pain, tremors, difficulty concentrating, nausea, and difficulty walking, at this point I stopped taking the concerta due to inability to find primary care as I moved. My cardiologist suggested I may have celiac disease and advised me to remove gluten from my diet, at this point I was having about 1 drink a week. I removed gluten and after a month symptoms had not improved, but I had begun to break through bleeding heavily. They ran a CBC, CMP, Iron panel, and screen for von willebrand\'s. My Iron Panel showed a high iron binding capacity (481 ng/ml), cmp showed elevated ALT (51 u/L), and CBC showed high rbc (5.32 Million/uL) and low MCH (26.7 pg). They ran a pelvic and abdominal ultrasound which showed a 3 cm cyst on my liver, but otherwise normal. I had an mri of the Brain and spine which came back normal other than sinusitis. I stopped the gluten free diet and stopped drinking any alcohol. Then covid-19 lockdown began, and after a couple weeks my symptoms began to improve.\n\nI remained relatively fine until August 2020 when I caught covid-19 and despite relatively mild symptoms, they continued for months. I had severe brain fog, confusion, shortness of breath, and fatigue that continued for almost 3 months. I began having severe allergic reactions to anything and everything and started breaking out in red rashes and hives every time I showered. After 3 months, my covid symptoms improved, but the new rashes remained. I changed laundry detergent and they began to improve. At this point, I stopped taking any medications other than birth control and benadryl.\n\nIn July 2021, I started to notice that my B.O. was beginning to smell like wet paint, and towards the end of July I started back on concerta. August 2021, I had a migraine that lasted 4-5 days. As soon as it began to improve, I had severe pain in my right shoulder that kept me from being able to move my arm. The shoulder pain only lasted 1-2 days. After that, I started having severe intermittent abdominal pain in the RUQ, RLQ, and LUQ. I was referred to gastroenterology who suggested a MRCP and a low fat diet with increased fiber to improve any constipation. Before I could schedule my MRCP, I started having visual distortions including floaters and visual static that look like tiny dots across the entire visual field. I never had aura with my migraines before so it was a little concerning. Shortly after, I developed weakness primarily in the right leg causing difficulty walking and numbness and tingling on my arms and legs.\n\nI went to the ER where they ran an EKG, estimated GFR, Tropinin T, HCG, CBC, CMP, and CT of the brain. The CBC showed high RBC (5.15 M/mcl), hematocrit (43%), and low mch (25.8 pg) and mchc (30.9 g/dL). I was referred to ophthalmology which ordered an mri of the brain and orbits which was normal other than cysts in the maxillary sinuses. My visual field and ophthalmic imaging came back normal. She also ran AQP4 AB, RO52, RO60, AND LA IGG, LYME ANTIBODIES, TREPONEMA PALLIDUM, SED RATE, C-REACTIVE PROTEIN, MYELIN OLIGODENDROCYTE GLYCOPROTEIN IGG, ANTI NEUTROPHIL CYTOPLASMIC ANTIBODY, ANA, AND ANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME, all came back normal. At this point, I began having severe muscle cramps and confusion with black outs. I followed up with cardiology, which assured me that the new symptoms were not related to my POTs.\n\nI began seeing a new neurologist who only did telehealth, she noted that I was unable to complete the tandem walk without falling, but the rest of the neuro exam was unremarkable. She ran a myositis panel, musk antibody, acetylcholine recep binding, and aquaporin 4 igg which were all normal. They ran and EMG with nerve conduction study which came back normal. MRI of the complete spine was also normal. Next was an EEG which came back normal as well. Then TSH, Thyroxine (T4), and vitamin b12. I started having difficulty swallowing which led to a fluoro esophagram which showed delayed stomach emptying and a small hiatal hernia. They then did a upper endoscopy with esophageal biopsy, which also came back normal. The neurologist tried beta blockers which dropped my heart rate down to the low 40s.\n\nI started seeing a new primary who ran Hep B and C, Rheumatoid factor, anti-ccp, anti dna, and porphyrins. My anti-ccp came back mildly elevated (22) and porphyrins, fract, random showed high coproporphyrin I (49.3). Genetic testing for porphyria came back negative. They did a cutaneous never biopsy came back normal as well. I saw another specialist who noted a mildly positive hoffmans sign on the right side. He started me on several types of vitamin and supplements, none of which helped. In June 2022, I started having sudden improvement only 3-4 after discontinuing concerta. I stopped having symptoms until October 2022 when all the symptoms gradually began to return starting with the abdominal pain.\n\nRheumatology ran x-rays of my neck, hands, and feet which showed minor instability in C3 and swelling in my feet. She noted hypermobility in my ankles, but otherwise normal and told me I likely don\'t have RA and referred me to ortho. I finally saw allergy who told me I likely have MCAS, and gastro sent in a referral for a gastric emptying study to confirm diagnosis of gastroparesis. Ortho ran an MRI of my c-spine in flexion and CT. The CT was normal and the MRI showed a loss of cervical lordosis. Ortho referred me out to neurology and that\'s where we are now.\n\nI ordered a full genome sequencing through a private company to see if there\'s anything there, I have an outstanding MRI of the brain that was ordered Feb 2023. Are there any suggestions of what I should do next?'"

Duration of complaint: 18 days. Location: pain in right upper quadrant, swelling throughout abdomen. Existing medical issues: extremely heavy alcohol user, recently had blood results of GGT 689 and ALT 117. Previously had appendix removed in 2018. Have had PCOS since 2013. Current medications: sertraline 50mg daily.\n\nThrowaway account because I\'m embarrassed. \n\n**Background**: I have been drinking alcohol on and off to various degrees since age 18. I began drinking alcohol much more heavily when the pandemic began in 2020, on average one litre of wine per day. In early 2021 bloodwork revealed elevated liver enzymes: GGT was 100 (normal range 12-37) and ALT was 61 (normal range 36 and under). I stopped drinking completely, had repeat bloodwork two months later, and both GGT and ALT were back in the normal range.\n\nI stayed sober for a while, but alcoholism got the better of me... for the past three months I have been drinking more heavily than ever, on average two to three litres of wine per day.\n\n**Current complaint**: on February 18 I woke up with a sharp pain in my abdomen which developed overnight, I had been fine the day before. The pain is in my upper right abdomen, where my bottom rib is. It doesn\'t hurt constantly, but hurts if I cough, sneeze, or if I push on it. It also hurts if I\'m jostled around, for example going over a speedbump in a car.\n\nMy abdomen is also quite distended. It\'s been that way for a few years, I was told due to PCOS, but it feels worse than usual now. Pants that fit me earlier this year don\'t anymore. \n\nThe pain wasn\'t going away, so I made an appointment with my doctor. Saw her March 1, she physically examined me and said I sounded short of breath, my oxygen levels were 96. Had an x-ray March 1 which came back normal. Had bloodwork March 2 which came back with **GGT 689, ALT 117**. All other blood counts related to liver (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) are normal range. All other results from complete blood count are normal, urinalysis normal. (I have access to the complete results if it would help.)\n\nThe GGT scared the shit out of me... I expected it to be high, but. \n\nDoctor called me March 3 to share the blood work results. She said she had never seen GGT this high ever in her career, and told me I needed to immediately stop drinking (which I of course have). She said she would send me for repeat blood work in one month.\n\nI asked if any other tests were needed at this point, like an ultrasound, she said no, just to stop drinking entirely and get repeat bloodwork done in a month. I asked if it was safe to take Advil for pain, and if I should adjust my diet: she said no, just no alcohol and repeat bloodwork in a month. I pushed a bit and asked if there was anything else to be done at this point, she said all I can do is avoid alcohol entirely.\n\n**Steps I have taken**:\n\n* Stopped drinking immediately and entirely (seven days fully sober)\n* At this point I am scared sober and have zero desire to drink, but have sought out alcohol support groups and quitting resources just in case\n* Started taking Vitamin B1, and [this natural supplement](https://www.omegaalpha.ca/consumers/liver-flush/) which contains milk thistle and other ingredientsdoctor said both were safe to take\n* Started gently exercising\n* Reduced salt intake drastically\n* Drinking a lot of water\n\n**Reason I\'m here**: I\'m trying not to do the panicked Googling, but from what I can tell my numbers are liver-failure, cirrhosis-level high and according to some, worthy of immediate follow up tests. I am trying to keep calm and trust my doctor, but I wanted a second opinion on a few things:\n\n* Should I be pushing for an imaging test now, or trust doc and go back in a month?\n* Is it safe to be taking Advil? Doc said yes, but I\'m seeing that it can stress the kidneys if liver issues are present. \n* If I have ascites, which I think I may, is drinking lots of water making it worse? I feel like the pain is lessened in the morning, and worse towards the end of the day after I\'ve eaten and drank. \n* Anything else I should be doing?\n\nThanks in advance and sorry for the lengthiness, wanted to provide as much detail as possible.'"

I have not been scanned in any way sense the headaches occurred so the purpose of this post is just to maybe brainstorm about why this is happening. Everyday usually around 11-12 midday, I will start to feel a swelling type headache above my right eyebrow the area is sensitive to touch, the bones the muscles, I can feel it slightly in my vision. It also causes a stiffness in my neck but I have ruled out a cervico genic headache because I have been to physical therapy and a chiropractor and nothing seems to work to loosen my neck, thus help with the headache. I have cut back on drinking alcohol, I quit smoking entirely, I have cut back on caffeine, and nothing has worked. It is visibly swolen when I look in the mirror on that side of my face. The only thing that brings slight relief are pain killers and an ice roller applied to that part of my face(pretty much just numbing it). I have been relatively dependent on ibuprofen for the past year and Im exhausted and miserable at this point. Anyone have any ideas, tips or suggestions.'"

She is of normal weight. She now thinks she's likely allergic to my dog, which is totally possible. The first time she got the reaction I was concerned for her safety. She went to urgent care and they weren't sure if it was bacterial or allergic reaction so they treated for both. She wasn't getting any better so I offered her a steroid pack since she was being stubborn about it and then she got better damn near immediately.\n\nHer second reaction lasted less long and benadryl helped thankfully. Now she wants to come over this weekend and thinks if she brings her own pillow that she'll magically avoid dog dander? I'm pretty sure that's not how allergies work, am I right here? Like, wouldn't the bed need to be free of the dog entirely and maybe run a hepa filter or something?

I have had a history of increased heart rate (HR) with no changes in blood pressure. \n\n24F ; 187lbs ; 165cm \n\nMedications: bisopropol, prazosin, norethisterone \n\nHere is the history:\n\nNov 2019: presented to hospital after serious right tibial plateau fracture requiring 5 surgeries. Was held for 2 weeks + a couple days presenting with excessive HR (130-170 at rest even during sleep). Did ecg, bloods and blood clot tests to rule out major causes. Was told it was most likely an interaction between medication (quatiapine and something else)and general anxiety. Only took this as needed and only twice during my stay. \n\nMid Feb 2020: presented to hospital with abscess and suspected osteomyelitis after complaining about pain and swelling in unrelated area far from surgery site. Removal of large area of tissue in leg and aggressive course of 24h IV antibiotic for month or 2? Unsure if high HR was present here. \n\n2020-2021: Health good, HR good though occasional surgeries to help with leg. \n\n2022: began presenting with elevated HR, crazy weight gain and a lot of fluid buildup. Fingers/toes/legs would swell often. Resting rate (~120-170) wake up in hot sweats and heart pounding. When exercising HR (170-190+). Drowsy, tired, light headed and sometimes nauseous. Symptoms were looked into but nothing came back abnormal apart from HR. Doctors elected to put on 2.5mg Bisopropol which helped with HR though sometimes would not. \n\n2023-present: Am still presenting with high HR, palpitations, lethargic, weakness, swelling of legs/ankles/toes/fingers but new symptoms as well. I often feel weak in my joints, my veins in my arms hurt, pain similar to the first time I got the bone infection and abscess, and feverish. I especially feel terrible on days where I have not slept well or little sleep. Increased medication to 5mg bisopropol. \n\nTests and results: \nECG (many): normal apart from high HR specially when changing elevation but can appear without change. \n\nEchocardiogram: all within normal ranges, volumes normal, no abnormalities. \n\nHolter monitor: no traces of abnormal rhythm though fluctuations between HR during day. \n\nX-ray of leg: no signs of osteomyelitis. \n\nBlood tests: all normal and within healthy ranges. No signs of lupus, thyroid or kidney disfunction, no signs of anti leuccocyte antibody, negative for autoimmune issues, negative for rheumatic disease, normal haematology. Lower rates of b-12 but within normal ranges 281 pmol/l (135-650).\n\nOnly issues that have been tested twice that have come back abnormal are: \n\n2 months ago:\n\nBicarbonate 18mmol/l (22-32)\nC reactive protein: 9.6mg/l (0.0-5.0)\n\nNow: \n\nBicarbonate 19mmol/l (22-32)\nAnion Gap: 21mmol/l (10-20)\nC reactive protein: 11.2mg/l (0.0-5.0)\n\nI am in need of advice. Most of the doctors I go to have given up and just placed me on the meds to moderate it. I am too young for these issues (24) and am frustrated that although tests come back normal other things are being ignored. I feel like I am being dismissed. Have appointment finally with cardiologist in August. If anyone has any hunches or can tell me some tests to suggest to doctors I would highly appreciate it. Also have blood test results and such if other figures are important. Thanks'"

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13n0rg0/paging_dr_house/,b'Paging Dr. House!',"b'Sorry for the long post, but here goes.\n\nMy wife (34F) has been stuck with a mysterious illness since about January of this year. She\'s been to the ER numerous times, many urgent care visits, has seen just about every specialist under the sun and we\'re still here with no answers, only things that have been ruled out. Just figured maybe someone on here might have ideas or further steps we can take to get a quicker diagnoses so we can get her on the mend. She\'s 5\'3"" and 120lbs if any of that matters. I\'ll go over the general timeline:\n\n\\-November 2019: She was sick with some undiagnosed illness (fever, sore throat, diarrhea, nausea, etc.). She tested negative for strep & flu and there were no tests for COVID-19 at the time as it wasn\'t really a widespread thing at that point.\n\n\\-Following that, she had shortness of breath off and on that\'s still ongoing, sore throat for about a year afterwards.\n\n\\-Spring 2021: She had blood in her stool, so she had a colonoscopy in July 2021 that came back clear except for some white plaques that her GI doctor had never seen before so he suggested she see another specialist about those, but her job was very tight with time off and her issues resolved so she never followed up.\n\n\\-2020-2022: During COVID, she worked in a rehab treatment facility that really didn\'t do much through COVID. They masked but barely tested and refused giving tests to their staff. So she never tested positive for COVID but she never tested negative either and was sick off an on during her time there. I had COVID in May 2022 but she didn\'t catch it at that time when I had it. She was vaccinated though.\n\n\\-January 2023: After going out to dinner and having Pho, we were walking around a bookstore and she felt extremely uneasy, heart-racing, lightheadedness, felt like her blood was on fire that was somewhat alleviated when she would sit down, but would start up again when she stood back up to walk around. Went to urgent care, all blood tests came back clear but the doctor suggested she look into dysautonomia. Sure enough, any time she stands up, her heart-rate shoots up for a little bit so we assumed she just had that and carried on.\n\n\\-March 2023: After mowing the lawn and eating some chips, she felt sharp pain about an inch to the right of her belly button. Went to urgent care in case of appendicitis or something emergent. They did an X-Ray and everything looked fine. Said he noticed she was backed up a bit even though she had pooped earlier that day and didn\'t feel backed up. Doctor suggested maybe it was an ovarian cyst that burst. So we went on our way.\n\n\\-March 2023: After having dinner (seafood), she noticed her nose running while eating and was having difficulty breathing. Went to the ER and they prescribed her some steroids and sent her on her way saying they didn\'t note any signs of anaphylaxis.\n\n\\-Since then, she\'s been having a multitude of symptoms which include\n\n\\-Chest pain\n\n\\-Shortness of breath\n\n\\-Abdominal Pain\n\n\\-Numbness in the back of her right knee\n\n\\-Burning hands (left palm specifically)\n\n\\-Throat tightness\n\n\\-Occasional electric jolt pains in tongue and throat\n\n\\-GI distress\n\n   \\-Routine diarrhea and loss of appetite (comes and goes. Sometimes she\'ll be extremely hungry and others she doesn\'t want to eat anything).\n\n\\-Occasionally sandy black vaginal discharge\n\n\\-Ice pick headaches in her temples\n\n\\-Visual snow\n\n   \\-Her sclera in both eyes are becoming a blue-ish/grayish tint and was referred to a research university for further evaluation on.\n\n   \\-Adrenaline spikes/feelings impending doom\n\n   \\-Increased heart rate that sometimes wakes her up from sleep\n\n   \\-Night sweats\n\n   \\-Fatigue\n\nA lot of these symptoms seem to come and go and it\'s almost like ""spin a wheel and see what the most prominent symptom is going to be for this week"" then it\'ll either subside or just become less prominent. The first two weeks she felt awful and just wanted to lay in bed, then she had a few weeks of feeling a bit better, but recently she seems to be feeling really rough again. Currently, she\'s dealing with intense abdominal pain that kind of circles around her belly button. There is a slight lump that seems to be where the pain is at the time. It\'s not a round bump but more of a line. She went to Urgent Care in Texas while visiting her father for it, the doctor didn\'t think it was a hernia and assumed maybe an abscess so he prescribed her clindamycin and scheduled her for a CT scan the next day just before our flight back home. The CT Scan showed a kidney stone (which she already knew about but wasn\'t moving), kidney cyst, and a ""tiny fat-containing umbilical hernia"". When we got back home, she called her PCP and he got her in right away, assessed her and her noted diminished bowel sounds and recommended she go to the ER in case of chronic appendicitis or a strangulated hernia. At the ER, they were able to open up the CT scan from Texas and were confused because the CT scan they did stopped just below her belly button so they did their own. In the most recent CT scan, they did not note any umbilical hernia, but did noted fluid in the pelvic cul-de-sac, the kidney stone, and said the ""appendix is not identified with certainty, although there are no secondary signs of acute appendicitis in the lower right abdominal quadrant"".  They also noted anteverted uterus. The ER doctor said she was unsure of what was causing it but thought maybe it could be caused by endometriosis and to follow-up with gynecology and to maybe consider PID. She has a Mirena IUD.\n\nShe had an endoscopy earlier this month that came back mostly clear other than a diverticula in the stomach and small throat nodules. The GI doctor said the nodules didn\'t look nefarious but she should go to an ENT for further evaluation so she has an appointment scheduled next month.\n\nSo far we haven\'t gotten any answers over the past few months and it\'s frustrating. Some things that have been ruled out:\n\n   \\-Negative ANA\n\n   \\-Negative RA Factor\n\n   \\-Normal 5-HIAA test\n\n   \\-Normal TSH:T4 Free\n\n   \\-Negative for Celiac\n\n   \\-Negative for Lyme Disease\n\n   \\-Negative for Strep, COVID, and Flu\n\n   \\-Had a Brain MRI last summer that came back only with a left choroid fissure cyst but nothing else. She has another scheduled in June to see if anything has changed since this all started.\n\n   \\-Normal Iron levels\n\n   \\-Normal Vitamin B-12\n\n   \\-Normal Magnesium\n\n   \\-Allergist tested her for allergies and didn\'t note any signs of any allergies.\n\n   \\-GI Doctor gave prescribed her omeprazole which seemed to help significantly with chest pain. \n\n  \n\nSome abnormal test results she\'s had\n\n   \\-Covid Spike antibodies were ""Greater than 2,500 u/mL""\n\n   \\-Low Vitamin D\n\n   \\-Traces of blood in urine detected by urinalysis\n\n   \\-Albumin levels have been consistently high-normal around the 5.1 g/dL range\n\n   \\-Glucose levels have been slightly high, then normal, then slightly high again off and on.\n\n   \\-Low BUN in one of her tests but has been normal every other time\n\n   \\-WBC were high once at 12.0 K/uL but have been normal every since. RBC has been normal.\n\n  \\-Numerous imaging scans (X-Rays, Ultrasounds, CT Scans) that mostly show nothing concerning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe\'s had multiple appointments with specialists.\n\n  \\-Allergist noted lung function of 67% back when her symptoms were at their worst. Allergist prescribed her an albuterol inhaler which seemed to only make her symptoms worse when she used it. Went to the ER when the inhaler wasn\'t working so they gave her a nebulizer which also didn\'t help at all. She saw a pulmonologist more recently who retested her and noted marked improvement in her test. Still not great, but much better. \n\n  \\-Physical therapist noted likely hypermobility disorder, likely Ehlers-Danlos.\n\n   \\-Cardiology tests: Normal stress echo, normal calcium scoring. She did a two-week heart monitor which noted ""Other SVT"" with count of 10 and longest episode of 11 beats. They told her that her heart was skipping beats on both the bottom and top of the heart.\n\nEverything else comes back fairly normal and doctors always say ""your bloodwork looks good"" She\'s probably had the typical CBC and Comprehensive Metabolic done 10 times since this all started because they always run those when she goes to urgent care or ER. Urine tests as well.\n\nWe\'re very much feeling extremely lost and scared because we\'re not getting any answers. We\'re wondering if anyone here may have ANY idea of what might cause what she\'s experiencing. \n\nShe still has a few specialist to see so hopefully we\'ll have some answers soon. She\'s seeing a surgeon for a consultation about her abdominal pain. She\'s seeing her gyno about her possible endometriosis and doing a intravaginal ultrasound. She\'s got an appointment with an ENT, the medical research university about her eyes, the brain MRI, oncologist, and another follow-up with her PCP upcoming. So it\'s possible we get answers soon, but it\'s getting really hard to be patient when she\'s in such distress. Her mother has a few autoimmune disorders so that was our first thought but all those tests seem to come back clear and it\'s been difficult getting her scheduled with a rheumatologist because it seems like they don\'t want to see anyone who has a negative ANA and RA Factor.\n\nJust wondering if anyone looking at what\'s going on has any ideas because it seems like the things we thought it was have all been ruled out and we\'re stuck with no idea on what can be causing these symptoms that seem to expand all across her body, not just in one spot.'"

I started writing ABCs with my foot and doing some other at home physical therapy exercises and the healing seemed to progress well. The swelling took a while to significantly go away (I do have horrible circulation) and the bruising went away completely after about 2 weeks. Never at any point did I lose my ability to walk on it. Fast forward to today and there is still some tenderness to the touch for the ligaments(?) that are above the ankle bone and to the left, almost feels like a bruise when pressed. There is still some very slight swelling, not noticeable to me unless compared to my right. It doesn\'t feel unstable but I haven\'t regained full mobility. \n\nAbout two weeks ago I started running at the gym once a week, for the first two runs it felt fine, but I noticed it seemed more tender and slightly more swollen after. I bought an ankle brace to wear, but the compression was a little uncomfortable so I didn\'t try wearing it while I ran. While wearing it at home, I went to pull it off after not unlacing it enough and I think I may have strained a muscle doing that. It\'s the muscle on the outside of my leg above my ankle. Due to this, my ankle has become more uncomfortable and I\'m more aware of its tightness and lack of mobility now.\n\nSo my question is, would wearing an aircast boot for a week or so help an old sprain heal? I really wish I had gotten one when I first strained it. I was wondering if reducing the weight on it when I\'m walking or going up and down stairs would help, along with doing more at home PT. I know I should go to physical therapy now that I\'m back in the US, but I haven\'t gotten health insurance yet and I want to exhaust all other options before going the most expensive route. \n\ntldr; I\'m 29F, 5\'8"" 135 lbs with no pre-existing conditions. I have a 7 month old ankle sprain that won\'t heal past about 85% of normal mobility and function. I want to know if wearing an aircast walking boot for a week or so, in addition to doing at home PT, would be helpful at this point or if it\'s too late for that and I should just do PT.'"

I have had sepsis twice this year \n\n\\- Constant nasal ulcers that become infected with Staph - they can't tell if the original ulcer is Staph or cold sore but they are grossly contaminated with Staph. I have to have on going anti virals and AB to control it\n\n\\- Raynauds - but it runs in the family. (Have been tested many times for Lupus (mum has lupus) and negative - however, have been put on Plaquenil to see if it helps with symptoms - i often get the butterfly rash)\n\n\\- Skin infections that turn into cellulitis quite quickly and need IV Antiobiotics\n\n\\- Episodic Vertigo but when it's bad I fall over\n\n\\- Started having seizures in 2021 - had never had seizures before that. Controlled with meds.\n\n\\- Enlarged and cupped/swollen optic nerves - waiting for neurology review but when i was in hospital they were certain it was not MS. However, I cannot have lumbar puncture. I have transient neurological symptoms such as gait issues/tremor/balance issues but hard to tell if its that or spinal issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy biggest concern is the weak immune system and severe itching and bruising - I end up in hospital way too often and am sick of feeling unwell. \n\nAny suggestions welcome because I will be pursuing another opinion and am going to start being more assertive to get help. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome photos here: [https://imgur.com/a/hILx8UI](https://imgur.com/a/hILx8UI)"""

After getting up I felt very sick and was trying to be sick, but nothing was coming up. I also noticed when I woke that my face has become very swollen and feels almost greasy... And it has this horrible yellow tint to it.\n\nIn retrospect I probably should have went to the hospital when I collapsed, but I really don't have a lot of money and it costs to get an ambulance. Things are definitely better now as I'm not shivering or being sick , but I'm obviously in a lot of pain and I'm quite worried about my face as I'm not sure what to do about it, or even what it is...

The spasms last 20min - 2 hours and are very painful, no clear precipitant. Initially once per week, now once or twice per day. They arent triggered by cold or activity, and will come on suddenly at any time. They have occurred in my neck, forearms, biceps (pictured), hands (pictured), legs, and feet (pictured). I have also been noticing a lot more bruises that I am unsure where they are coming from (I do not play contact sports). In addition to random leg swelling, mottled skin (never previously noticed), and dizziness with a few syncopal events. No seizure activity, textbook vasovagal. I dont think these are varicose veins as they are occurring all over my body, and are not visible when they arent in spasm. I have tried compression garments and they dont seem to help. They are also occurring most frequently in my hands, arms, and just above my clavicle on my right side. \nAny ideas what is going on?\nThank you!'"

This time it concerns an intensely painful swelling of my tailbone, which started 2 weeks ago for no discernible reason.\n\nPATIENT OVERVIEW\n\nI am a 29-year old White male from Vancouver, Canada. 57 feet tall, 130 lbs. 100% pure from all illicit substances. I have a genetic heart condition, a history of prolonged sexual / emotional abuse, and am afflicted by OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), which damaged my joints through ritualized cracking.\n\nHISTORY OF AILMENT\n\nMy maternal grandmother has a split tailbone and claims this is genetic. I am unsure whether I had tailbone issues as a young child, given that she locked me in a crib all day or a plush chair. However, at age 9 I fell down stairs and landed full-force upon concrete on my tailbone, which caused a small crack, excruciating agony, and inability to walk well or sit down for a week. I received no medical attention for this injury.\n\nDuring overweight adolescence, sitting became a constant pain, yet my grandmother kept me at a computer nearly 24/7. In adulthood, I lost weight and the issue resolved despite a continually sedentary lifestyle. Years later, *Return of the Tailbone Slam* is happening in my pants.\n\nTHE CURRENT PROBLEM\n\nTwo weeks ago my entire tailbone enlarged and now sticks out as a swollen, hard bump under the skin. It is impossible to sit on the softest surfaces, and getting up from a seat guarantees a lightning bolt of agony. I feel a duller pain even while standing or walking around. The locus of pain is the lower part above the anus. The top part creates no pain.\n\nMy legs are also spontaneously weakening and numbing out of nowhere. Moreover, I often feel tingles explode from the tailbone up my back while trying to fall asleep on my right side.\n\nNothing changed in my physical existence to induce these issues. I have a semi-bedridden existence ever since my Covid infection in February, given that bed is my current refuge from mental stressors. Though I browse the phone on my back, I sleep on my side. I eat the same foods (pizza daily), and take the same medication (Clonazepam aka Klonopin). Weight is stable at 128-132 lbs. No injuries or strenuous activity lately. FYI soon I will implement a healthier lifestyle.\n\nQUESTIONS\n\n- Can anyone identify the cause of this sudden tailbone swelling and leg weakening?\n\n- Will it resolve on its own?\n\n- Any remedies to encourage it to heal?\n\n- Does it require medical attention?\n\n- Is a split tailbone actually a genetic issue, as my grandmother claimed?\n\n- Can an infection get into an old tailbone fissure? If yes, how and why?'"

Docs arent talking about discharge at all. What gives?',"b'My FIL (69m, white, diabetes, hypertension, hx of gastric bypass) has had a really rough go of it after aortic valve replacement in March.  Within days, he was opened back up and a coronary artery bypass was performed.  They couldnt close him due to swelling, so he was kept open for 4 days.  Closure was successful, within days, he was starting to wake from his induced coma, and he seemed to be on the mend.\n\nSoon after waking, his O2 kept dropping and he was struggling to breathe.  They intubated him again and he was on a ventilator for a few weeks.  (He struggled with pleural effusion, fluid in lungs, and partially collapsed lung during this time, as well).  He was diagnosed with pneumonia and given antibiotics.  The tube kept moving, so they put in a trach.  His O2 stabilized and over the course of a few weeks, the trach was capped and he was breathing normally with oxygen through those nose things.\n\nHe was transferred to a rehab hospital where he was receiving PT, nursing, and OT.  But the pneumonia persisted.\n\nLast week, he was feeling worse and by chance had an appt already on the books to see his cardiologist for an evaluation to determine if some movement restrictions could be lifted.  The doctor didnt even take him to an exam room.  Told the medical transport to take him to the ED.\n\nHe admitted back into the cardiac ICU with a guarded/stable prognosis for acute respiratory failure, hospital acquired pneumonia, sepsis, and anemia.  A few days ago, he was transferred down to ICU but has IV antibiotics.  Apparently he has an 8 cm access in his lung, and he has tubes to drain it.  Things seem to be moving in the right direction again.\n\nHe cant get the trach out until the infection passes (according to MIL), but I suspect its bc they think he might need it down the road.  \n\nHe is definitely demonstrating some cognitive issues and idk if its the pain killers or infection or trauma thats causing it\n\nEverything Im reading about sepsis says to not expect him to go home for weeks, but my MIL keeps saying things like he stood up independently/took a few steps/sitting up to eat/etc. so hell be home any day now.\n\nShe wont ask questions that might result in any answers that differ from this notion of him being home any day now.  She didnt even know he had sepsis until I read his admitting documentation from the ED (with FILs permission) and told my BIL to ask his mom about it.  \n\nShes in some kind of weird denial.  I dont plan to press the issue, but I also dont want her to be caught off guard if his health starts tanking again.  I personally believe this kind of language is an elaborate coping strategy, but am willing and hoping Im wrong.\n\nSo Im wondering: is it actually likely that he will go home soon?  Is there a reason the doctors arent being more direct with her about his discharge?  Can IV antibiotics be administered at home by a loved one via picc line?  Is sepsis a long-term issue or is it done after treatment?\n\nI just am not understanding what is going on, and dont want to say the wrong thing or overstep.  I would appreciate any general insight into how sepsis runs its course, what treatment looks like, and what discharge criteria we might look out for.'"

He was an Oncologist who was supposed to specialize in blood disorders. He was very abrupt and spent less then five minutes with me, didn't look over the tests I brought with me and was overall very abrasive. I had several blood tests and imaging done that he didn't look over nor did he do an exam of the swollen lymph nodes I was in his office for. Just ordered a ct scan and left.\n\nFor a bit of background I have had intense pain around my thyroid and surrounding neck muscles as well as my shoulder and back of neck. I noticed swollen lymph nodes on my right side in September when I first noticed the pain but they may have been there since I was hospitalized for covid in Jan 2022 or the clostridium difficile I treated shortly after that. \n\nUltrasound and and X Ray I had in November confirmed I had a swollen lymph node but everything else was clear. All blood tests come back good except for inflammation which comes back double what is normal.\n\nThe pain migrates and is some place new everyday but tends to be worst in my neck. The area around my thyroid has been strange, sometime it feels like it has come loose and stings until I push on it and it pops back into place. \n\nAfter my covid infection I have had so many scans with radiation I have lost count. I had 2 ct scans, 5 chest x rays, I had a dentist mess up my teeth and it took 5 visits with xrays each time to get it fixed and 2 mammograms for unrelated issues.\n\nMy concern is that the ct scan will damage my thyroid more and not be precise enough since most of my pain is in soft tissue and I would eventually need an MRI anyway. I told the doctor about my concerns all he said to me was that some people get CT Scans every day. Then turned around and walked out the door. \n\nIt was very frustrating the way he completely dismissed my concern for my thyroid and more radiation exposure. Is a CT scan really preferable over an MRI when most of my problems are soft tissue? I always thought CT was more for bones?\n\nIf you stuck through and read all of this I appreciate it. It has been a difficult year for me health wise and it seems more and more problematic trying to get doctors to listen. I have all of the paperwork for the tests and imaging I have had if anyone is interested in seeing those.\n\nThank you"""

The following are the health issues I have.   \n\n\nI've had GERD since I was 23. Have been taking on and off medications for it. Recently got an endoscopy done which revealed H.Pylori and some swelling in duodentis so treating for it via antibiotics. Doctor said just to adjust lifestyle for this mostly.  \n\n\nPossible Arrythmia. I am not sure about this one. But I get tired very soon. I've had palpitations since I was 13. I can never long enough, or get tired very soon after a physical activity, it also feels like my heart begins to tighten if I overdo anything. I am worried about getting this checked out and seeing what it reveals. And If I will need ablation or something.  \n\n\nGeneral Anxiety Disorder & Persistent Depression. Got diagnosed with both of these when I was 25. Took medications for both for 3 years but later stopped after I felt it wasn't working anymore. I am functional and can manage most days and do have ambition and willpower to help myself so I feel its not bad but all this health problems and my domestic environment (drunk dad) makes things worse for me and makes me crippled to take any decision.   \n\n\nPossible ADHD. I've always had trouble concentrating, procrastination, being present in the moment. Have to get this diagnosed but worried about the lifelong medication on this.  \n\n\nNeuropathy. I drank too much one day in 2018. and next day woke up with my hands and legs on fire. Doctor said neuropathy, after that for few years I was fine. In 2021 towards end I started feeling severely fatigued. Arms and Legs would pain and twitch, also had restless leg syndrome. I did a nerve conduction study which revealed that my large fiber nerves were ok but my small fiber was a little messed up. Took medications, most of it got ok but my arms don't have the same power as they did before, get tired very soon if I lift something or hold them up in air for too long.   \n\n\nTinnitus/Migraines. I had an earwax impact in 2017, after that I removed my earwax and realized I had been hearing less than I should have. Had hyperacusis for a while. Now ringing is constant in my left ear. It doesn't bother me much although, but I wear earplugs because for some reason the vibrations and sounds affect my inner ear. In 2022 I got ear wax removed again after that I started having headaches and migraines constantly. ENT doctor told me to do a MRI Scan but I am worried about the sound it will make and damage my ears further or worsen the headaches. Idk what to do with this. Doctor says it could be some nerve damage inside the ear.  \n\n\nMale Pattern Baldness. Have been losing hair since I was 23. Did some treatments to grow hair volume on and off and mostly procrastinated this because I was too crippled by many things to take care of myself. Now recently spoke with a Hair Doctor. He said my hair is norwood 3.5 going to 4. And that I could either do HT without fin or I can just maintain some volume with minoxidil. I don't mind taking fin but worried about how it will affect my body with the host of problems I have.  \n\n\nI am not sure why my body is like this, maybe because its been in perpetual stress living with my alcoholic father or just bad genetics. But I want to feel good, and look good and want to be able to do physical activities. I don't know what to tackle first. I have taken so much medication in the last 7 years. I am mostly worried about my heart and neuropathy because I want to be able to be active and then hair because I want to look good. Please help me out and guide what I should do."""

I say joints, but it feels more like a muscular problem, affecting behind my knees, my elbows, shoulders. I'm in the UK and I'm on my second blood test with no working theory, having ruled out rheumatoid arthritis on the first test (and everything from that workup coming back ok). \n\nFor a bit of history, I changed role at work back in February. I was driving an hour to the office and back one day a week before, but the new very stressful role required me to be in 3-5 days a week. I wasn't enjoying the role and definitely burned out, and thankfully was able to switch back. Anyway, about two weeks in, I started to feel some pain in my left knee, and was finding it hard to put weight on it. My only idea was that it might be repetitive strain because it was my clutch leg, and traffic can be slow with lots of gear changes. I started to develop a pain in the side of my hand as well as my left elbow (right hand drive remember) so thought it might be the driving.\n\nIt deteriorated to the point that I developed a limp. I couldn't put my weight on my left knee and spent two months unable to walk normally. Work still insisted I come in of course. The joint pain spread beyond those joints however to include my right elbow, knee and both shoulders. \n\nI managed to see a GP and I was put on Naproxen, which didn't seem to do anything. I changed jobs as I mentioned before, and while I've not been stressed since and my walk is nearly back to normal, the joint pains are still there. My muscles in general feel weaker, going up and down stairs takes more energy, carrying shopping bags is painful, kneeling down might mean I need help getting back up. Doc doesn't know what it could be yet and I can't find anything close on the NHS website. The second blood test is looking for possible nutritional deficiencies, and I've been referred to a Physiotherapist but it'll take weeks to be seen.\n\nThere are no visual signs e.g. swelling or redness. On a pain scale, it's not that bad, maybe 2-5/10, but I'm still worried. I often wake up with my left knee just aching.\n\n37M, 6ft, 90kg, white British. Not on any medication.

I'm vegetarian and my partner and I cook most of our meals with plenty of veg, but I'm not the best at remembering to take vitamin supplements or drink enough water. Diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder but don't know if that's relevant.\n\nThe only change in recent months was that job change. Can't think what else this might be.

On 10dpo the rash appeared again but way less severe and limited to my left ankle ([pictures provided](https://imgur.com/a/KGmvKRe)).  Very painful and itchy, swelling caused skin to blister.  I can feel hard lumps under the skin.  No rash around my abdominal incisions, overall recovery from hysterectomy has been very good.\n\nI have had other procedures over the years that involved general anesthesia but no rash (two colonoscopies, an elective appendectomy, and a hysteroscopy with biopsy).  My obgyn hadn\'t seen this before and recommended seeing a dermatologist (I haven\'t yet).\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1.  Can you identify what type of rash this is?  Urticaria?\n\n2.  Any treatment suggestions?  Hot foot soaks seem to help relieve the symptoms\n\n3.  What can I do to avoid this after future procedures?  I can review the medications administered for my hysterectomy, but I doubt I can access my procedure info from 2004 (or can I)?'"

They repeatedly downplayed my pain and didnt care to look at the photos of rashes and swelling, they barely glanced at a couple pages out of the 3 folders I brought to the appointment. I heard their NP arguing my case as he was genuinely concerned since I was almost put in a mental hospital recently due to stating the pain was so bad I wanted to die. \nThe rheum has my labs but stated I just show possibilities of connective tissue disease. \nCan anyone help me with pinpointing if it is MCTD or SLE which I saw in the notes? I was diagnosed with asthma at 8 yrs old and started steroidal inhalers, by 12 I was started on Prevacid due to heartburn and GERD, 15 years old diagnosed with juvenile arthritis, hospitalized with jaundice at 17, fibroid cysts in both breasts at 18. Multiple other issues have of course shown up since then including deteriorating eyesight, bad dental health even with proper care, repeated infections and sepsis, allergic to many antibiotics, severe gastro issues and inability to feel anything but dull pressure when having bowel movements, in a year I ballooned from 132lbs to 184lbs even though I dont eat much and ended up losing almost all the weight within 6 months however my thought and calves keep getting bigger. I have random Migraines,subluxations, multiple bulging discs and rotated hip and of course depression and anxiety. At the end of it all, again Im just being dismissed as depressed, and honestly at this point I dont see a reason to keep fighting. I cant work anymore because Im in pain so much and constantly having issues with pain or my stomach so it interferes with any type of adherence expectations. I tried starting my own business but failed miserably and now I just have a room full of crap and now I am overdue on everything at this point and cant stand to be a burden Im so frustrated and would appreciate any help with advice on how to fight for my diagnosis or what it could be.

Obesity is self-explanitory.*\n\n*No drinking, smoking, or recreational drug use*\n\n*No sexual history*\n\nIn the months after losing a parent to lung cancer, I decided to start taking inventory of every unexplained lump I came across, and eventually report them to my doctor. I found some on my chest, leg, and groin, but my doctor immediately dismissed the chest and leg ones. However, I was sent for an ultrasound to get a better look at the groin ones.\n\nThere\'s one on each side, and they\'re not visible above the skin, but easily palpable. From the outside, they feel about the size of something between a bean and a grape. They\'re fairly soft and very mobile. If you were to run your finger across where they usually sit, you wouldn\'t notice them because they move out of the way. They\'re painless 95% of the time, and only get sore under extended physical activity like yardwork. I am otherwise completely asymptomatic.  I believe I\'ve had these lumps for several years, but never thought to investigate them until recently. While waiting for an appointment, I kept track of their size over that month, and there was no noticeable change in shape or size. I was initially under the impression that these were hernias, as I was a competitive weightlifter during my teenage years, and I often practiced without a belt.\n\nI got the ultrasound, and here was the report.\n\n>Narrative  \n>  \n>Exam: Bilateral groin soft tissue  \n>  \n>HISTORY: Bilateral groin mass  \n>  \n>TECHNIQUE: Real-time 2-D grayscale and color Doppler imaging of the soft  \n>  \n>tissues of the groin performed.  \n>  \n>FINDINGS:  \n>  \n>There are multiple lymph nodes identified. These are reactive appearing.  \n>  \n>The largest on the right measures 2.6 x 1.7 x 3.9 cm. The largest on the left measures 3.6 x 1.5 x 2.4 cm. No additional fluid collection or mass. No hernia.  \n>  \n>Impression  \n>  \n>Bilateral large groin lymph nodes. Recommend clinical follow-up or imaging follow-up. If these are persistent, enlarging or otherwise clinically suspicious consider fine-needle aspiration.\n\nOn one hand, this was a relief. No need for a hernia surgery, and they weren\'t liposarcomas either. On the other hand, swollen lymph nodes are irritatingly ambiguous. And they seem like pretty big suckers, too. The report doesn\'t mention anything like the loss of fatty hilum, or strange vascularity, or matting, so I took that as a good sign for them being benign swellings. What surprised me though is that, upon reading the report, my doctor decided to go directly to FNA biopsy. I was expecting a followup to maybe try to find the reactive cause, as I suspect it might be related to an assumed skin infection of the groin that I\'ve had for several years (frequent ingrown hairs, occasional itching, raised hair follicles). I\'ve never looked into treatment for it since it\'s not particularly bothersome most of the time.\n\nI\'ve asked my doctor questions throughout this process, but their answers are usually pretty short and not super reassuring. I imagine they\'re very busy. I haven\'t had this doctor for very long, so I haven\'t built up a strong repertoire. So, I have a few questions, and would be exceedingly grateful to get some impressions on them.\n\n**Does anything in my story here suggest an increased risk for some sort of malignancy? I know there is always** ***some*** **risk but is this like ""textbook presentation of lymphoma"" or something?**\n\n* Unfortunately, I\'ve also consulted with Dr. Google and now Dr. ChatGPT, if you can believe it. As far as I have read, especially after having GPT recommend me some papers and textbooks, is that the nodes\' size and possibly ""rubbery"" texture might suggest a malignancy like lymphoma. It sounds like Ultrasounds are pretty good at catching metastatic malignancies, but less certain about lymphoma. It also seems that the inguinal region is a pretty rare place for lymphoma to first appear. I\'ve been getting mixed information about whether the bilateral growth is of any significance.\n\n**My doctor hasn\'t been informed about the skin condition, would it matter if I do so?**\n\n* The jump straight to biopsy kinda feels like that\'s the plan regardless of any new information, and that it\'ll be more definitive than anything else. But several resources have said that FNA on an inguinal lymphadenopathy tends to generate false negatives. Part of the reason I\'m asking here at all is that the biopsy is a couple of weeks off and the whole situation is messing with me.\n\n**Is it possible that my doctor and I are just communicating on different wavelengths?**\n\n* In my reading, bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy is usually suspected of an STD. I have no sexual history so I\'m like 99.99% sure this isn\'t the case. But my doctor doesn\'t know that, and they never actually asked. Am I possibly misinterpreting their caution approach? Where I\'m thinking cancer and they\'re thinking HIV because it\'s just statistically more likely?\n\n**TLDR: I have painless bilateral swollen groin lymph nodes, they\'ve been around at least 2 months at this point, but probably have been there for multiple years. I have a possible chronic skin condition in the same area. Otherwise asymptomatic. From a layman\'s perspective, both the physical exam and ultrasound report suggest benign reactive swelling, yet doctor\'s short, guarded responses to questions and quick jump to biopsy have me concerned that there\'s something I\'m missing. But it\'s possible we\'re just miscommunicating. What do you think about this case?**\n\nThank you very much for your time.'"

A painful, hard lump appeared on the side of my throat two days ago. I had originally thought it may be a swollen lymph node because of my sinus infection, but the urgent care doctor I saw today told me that it was instead a nodule on my thyroid that I should get checked out by a specialist (he suggested an ENT) and prescribed 500mg of prednisone three times a day. \n\nSome medical history  Im female, 20 years old, 56 and 185 pounds but I go to the gym frequently, eat well, and have noticeable muscle mass, so not in the worst shape. I had a tonsillectomy as a kid, maybe at four or five years old. My father has just beat prostate cancer as of last week, his sister had a rare and quickly degenerative form of skin or blood cancer in her 20s (died within months of a semi-early diagnosis), and my maternal grandmother had breast cancer. \n\nThis lump has scared me all day. Its hard and swollen and about the size of a cotton ball, maybe a hair smaller. It would protrude from my neck if I were skinnier but even now there is slight, noticeable swelling on the side of my neck that its on. I experience severe pain when I cough to the point that I whimper, moderate pain when I swallow, sip or squeeze it, and mild pain when I turn my head too severely in one direction. Coughing or squeezing the lump causes me to have headaches because of the pain. I could barely choke down a donut and ten bites of spaghetti all day yesterday. Additionally, my custom-tailored collared shirt was too tight around my neck last night. \n\nAs you can imagine Im very scared  I tick a lot of boxes, even some obscure ones (like with my age). I have an appointment at an ENT tomorrow morning, but Im just looking to know what my odds are of having a malignant diagnosis. Again, not looking for a diagnosis, just peace of mind.'"

No major medical issues, no meds, do not drink, smoke, or use recreational drugs. USA. Podiatrist recommending removal. Second opinion?\n\nBackground: Hello and thank you for taking the time to read my post. I am extremely anxious about the possibility of having both my big toenails removed. Some background info: I danced for two decades and played many sports, which caused problems with ingrowns on my big toenails all of my life. As an adult I am very active and love to wear high heels so they have continued to be a problem. In the last year I found a nail tech who I trust (cleanliness, gentleness, etc.) with my feet and only have pedicures done by her. Typically I leave with my big toes a little bit red, but more comfortable with continued improvement in the days following. In general I only occasionally have issues with the left big toe, but almost always have at least minor issues with the right. After my last pedicure I attended a music festival and was on my feet walking and dancing much more than usual. I did wear shoes I have worn before and not had any issues with. Unfortunately, my toes really took a beating and swelled up more than they ever have before, to the point where I made my first ever podiatry appt (5/26/23; please see details in timeline below). I was also already on antibiotics for a dental procedure, which made the level of inflammation especially concerning. The podiatrist recommended removal of the left toenail, citing that it was loose at the base and unlikely to improve on its own. He also diagnosed a granuloma on the right, and said a portion should be removed permanently.\n\nTo say I am freaking out is an understatement. Of course I want to do what is best for my health. I have always been self conscious of my toes, so the anxiety and distress this is causing me mentally is significant. More importantly, I model full time professionally, so having pretty feet is a requirement of the job and this will impact my ability to provide for myself. In addition, I will be traveling all of June (lots of walking, beach & pool time).\n\nMy Questions:\n\n* What is the best course of action?\n* Should I obtain a second opinion?\n* What course of outcome should I expect if I proceed conservatively and hold off on removal?\n* Should I continue with this routine (see below for details)?\n* How should I handle traveling--footwear, protection, etc.?\n* If I must proceed with removal, are there any cosmetic solutions?

However, especially since being on HRT (past 2.5 years), they've done all kinds of wild things based on changing temperature.\n\nIf it is warm (70+ F) and/or I moderately exercise, my hands turn pink and swell a great deal, sometimes to the point that it's hard to bend my fingers.\n\nIf it is even slightly cool (generally below 60F), they turn outright purple, sometimes unevenly (the more idle hand/usually my non-dominant is affected most). \n\nThese events do not cause me pain or affect my lifestyle very much otherwise, but I'm royally curious as to what's going on. My own GP was concerned enough to order an echocardiogram and EKG last summer, both of which were normal (my mom has long QT and a weak heart muscle, so they wanted to be sure. I also have 2-3 maternal female relatives who died of aortic aneurysms, but everything about me personally tested fine as far as I know). \n\nI was diagnosed with Reynaud's about 2 years ago as well due to the coldness and purpleness, which was less pronounced at that time, so maybe it's just that? But I also have never exhibited the white fingertips that I often see from other people with Reynaud's. \n\nI haven't had my blood tested in about a year but do have my yearly checkup coming up soon, which means they will probably do hematocrit and such since I am on testosterone.

Non-smoker.\n\nFor the last 1 1/2-2 years the right side of my neck swells and it stays that way for days, weeks or even months at a time. It has gradually become longer and more frequent. At this point it always feels slightly more swollen than the other side and my jaw is less defined on that side. When it's really bad, the edge of my face will also swell, including my earlobe and even up to my temple and I get pain around the bottom of my jaw that goes up behind my ear and into my head. \n\nAbout a year ago I started gagging easily (especially when brushing my teeth) and choking on nothing as it feels like my throat is full and anything can set off my gag reflex.I have previously been prone to ear infections but I haven't had one for years. My mother has Graves Disease and I think there's other thyroid disorder in the family I'm just not sure what. I had a dental checkup recently that didn't find anything that would explain it.\n\nI had an ultrasound in Feb and they found nodules on my thyroid:\n\nRight lobe 4.8 x 1.6 x 1.4cm, volume 6.3mlLeft lobes 4.0 x 1.8 x 1.4cm, volume 5.3mlComplex exophytic nodule extending from right isthmus 29 x 18 x 22mm, calcified lesion in mid pole 6 x 5mm. \n\nTiny solid lesions in lower pole on the left measuring 4 & 3mm. The region of interest corresponds to the prominent edge of the right parotid gland. The right parotid gland is unremarkable. Normal appearing lymph nodules. There is a TIRADS-4 nodule on the right isthmus and the other nodules are TIRADS-2.\n\nI had a biopsy in Feb with the following results:\n\nThyroid: Right lobe. Mid zone. Size in mm: 9.2x8.4. Echogenicity: Heterogenous. Margins: Ill-defined (Border of nodule difficult to distinguish from thyroid parenchyma in areas) . Composition: Solid (0 - <5 % cystic). Echogenic foci: Punctate (Dot-like foci with no posterior acoustic shadowing \\[<1 mm\\] ? Calcium, ? Hyperreflective colloid crystals) and macrocalcifications (> 1mm +/- posterior acoustic shadowing). Shape: Wider than tall. Doppler: no vascularity identified. Number of needle passes: 1. \n\nThyroid: Isthmus. Left of midline. Size in mm: 32.3x13.4 . Echogenicity: Heterogenous. Margins: Smooth (Uninterrupted. Well-defined. Curvilinear edge). Composition: Predominantly solid (Soft tissue =/> 50% of the nodule). Echogenic foci: Punctate (Dot-like foci with no posterior acoustic shadowing \\[<1 mm\\] ? Calcium, ? Hyperreflective colloid crystals) and macrocalcifications (> 1mm +/- posterior acoustic shadowing). Shape: Wider than tall. Doppler:Vascularity is mainly lesional.Degree of vascularity: mild. Number of needle passes: 1.Remainder of thyroid: No abnormality.\n\nFINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION CYTOLOGY. \n\nBoth nodules were identified and confirmed by matching with the previous images.This nodule felt focally gritty to the needle when traversed in multiple directions in a systematic fashion. The smears contain abundant thin and clumped colloid and multiple follicular epithelial fragments. The cellularity of the follicular tissue is within normal limits and a mixed pattern with a predominance of macro follicles an absence of architectural monotony is identified. There is no significant cytological atypia or architectural disarray. The microcalcification did not yield any calcific material or psammoma bodies and nuclear features of papillary carcinoma are not present. There is no lymphoplasmacytic reaction and the appearances are those of a follicular lesion with a benign pattern.The solid areas of this complex nodule were sampled in multiple directions in a systematic fashion. The smears contain abundant thin and watery colloid and multiple follicular epithelial fragments. Clumps of compact colloid are also present. The cellularity of the follicular tissue is within normal limits and a macrofollicular pattern is readily seen and there is no architectural monotony or cytological atypia. No calcific material or psammoma bodies have been aspirated and nuclear features of papillary carcinoma are not present.\n\nI had blood tests done in August 2022:\n\nTSH 1.5 mIU/LFT4 19 pmol/L\n\nFT3 5.9 pmol/LAnti-Thyroglobulin Abs (aTGI) < 1.3 IU/mL\n\nAnti-Thyroidal Peroxidase Abs 33 IU/mL\n\nMy GP doesn't think I need to see a thyroid specialist but also said he didn't know how close an eye we should be keeping on the nodules. He suggested seeing an ENT specialist next as he thinks the neck swelling and the nodules could be unrelated.\n\nI just wanted to get some other opinions as I am worried, it really just doesn't feel right at all. Any advice on what it might be, what to do next or how closely the nodules should be monitored would be really helpful. Happy to answer any questions or provide ultrasound images etc. \n\nThank you for your time."""

Knee effusion, circulation and joint issues.'","b'I am a 24 year old male and have been having a boat load of issues with my body since a knee effusion over 8 months ago. I made a post about that a while back. I have noted all the symptoms Ive had and created a timeline and list. I had finally got an appointment with orthopedics where they tested my knee fluid for gout and infection to no avail. They left me saying they have no idea what is wrong and I have a referral to rheumatology 3 months from now. Since then things have been getting much worse. \n\nLink to images I will be referencing:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/gGTrZra\n\nThe linked timeline has most of the symptoms Ive experienced in that past year and then some. I have tested myself for the following already: HIV, Lyme, thyroid, kidney, gout.\n\n\n\nI am looking for any advice in terms of what tests to run, things to look out for, literally any direction or suggestion to help me track down what is going on and prevent damage to my body. Ive had multiple medical professionals just ignore that something is seriously wrong with me. Ive also had one tell me I need to be my own detective to track down what is wrong. I am legitimately scared for my life, and worried that in those 3 months I could be hospitalized or die if things continue to get worse.\n\nIn terms of complications I am a type one diabetic who had okay control until the last 2 years where I had a high A1C of 8.4. I have had my sugars in range the past two weeks to eliminate it as a cause of symptoms. Ive also cut out all substances that might be messing with me. Ive never smoked and havent drank more than a few drinks in my entire life. \n\nMy knee swelling up (no redness), the pain in my abdomen, and occasional back aches were my first notable symptoms. None has gone away although the abdomen seems to be tied to constipation. The doctors never identified what caused either of these and the leg has been swollen 24/7 and the other two returns intermittently even up to today. I thought this incredible discomfort was the worst of it.\n\nThe second wave of symptoms occurred last month where I started feeling a tingling in my Right foot (the same leg as the effusion) and also noted a giant cyst in the back of my leg. This is when I saw orthopedics. She moved my leg saying I had no reason to worry about arthritis even though my X-ray had shown minor arthritic changes. She also had no concern for the cyst in the back of my leg. I did a knee aspiration and had the fluid tested for gout and infection. The fluid was synovial fluid. Following this I began feeling inflammation in my arms and legs at different times. I would noticed my clothes felt tighter one arm or ankle. I also felt like my arm was heavier. \n\nAfter my rheumatologist referral all things got worse. I got Covid march 17th, and on the 24th I started feeling a slight tingling in both feet and hands. It happened suddenly, followed by both hands and feet becoming red. The tingling was not persistent, but instead rotated around different parts of the affected area. My hands then became a purple and bright red splotchy mess. Here is a picture of my hands. At this point I took control of my blood sugars and have been in range since.\n\nThis is when I began to be scared. After 4-5 days the tingling was reduced but still comes back after a day at work or driving in the car. Basically contact made it worse. Ive noticed my hands still have redness on all the joints and the light swelling Ive been feeling has become stronger and more often. They turn purple on occasion especially when I am moving around and are cold to the touch. Ive begun to feel more tightness in spots such as my jaw and neck. My finger joints ache from time to time and the redness on the joints specifically has not subsided.\n\nAt this point I am stuck waiting over 3 months to see a rheumatologist and I am scared of symptoms worsening, or permanent damage to my body. The scariest part is my hands/feet since it seems like an acute circulation issue. While people have told me its long Covid I do not believe that since I broke my fever in two days and it was honestly not bad at all I barely even coughed. Also the tingling in my foot began before Covid. \n\nAt this point I am left waiting and I am at my mental and physical limit. Again any suggestions or advice is extremely appreciated. The timeline has some symptoms I didnt mention and a better idea of how everything has been progressing. I can provide you with any test results I may have done as well as any information that can help you help me.\n\nTLDR \nMy leg has been swollen for almost a year straight, my hands are red and purple, tingly, and cold. I have 3 months until I can see anyone who MIGHT have a clue. Im scared.'"

If my symptoms are needed I've felt fatigued, foggy head, a strange feeling in my chest, cold sweats, my limbs feeling heavy and resting for a bit has helped.

Keeps me awake at night and sometimes the flare ups are so bad I cant move at all and feel like Im on fire. Random swelling on joints. Butterfly rash on face, random sun rashes on body after going outside, extremely itchy skin to any drastic temp changes (hot weather/cold). \n\nHowever, my skin issues havent resolved either. If anything after starting the medication its worse. Consistent itchiness on arms/legs and even neck/face. To the point where it will become hives and rip open. I try not to itch but it can be unbearable. \n\nPlaquenil 50mg once daily. Meloxicam as needed (25mg). Honestly- not helping much. Before I started any medications, my bilirubin was 1.0 normally (I was tested every few months because they couldnt figure out what was wrong with me- and 1.0 is consistent). \n\nAs of March, 2023, it shot up to 2.4-2.6 and unfortunately hasnt gone down below 2.4 at all.

Ill attach a photo of that one as well. \n\nWhat do you think? Is it because of my glasses? From mask wearing (although I barely go out)? Is it just dry skin? Why is it symmetrical?

They look quite normal, but I had cut the other toenails like twice and the big toenails just don't seem to grow at all.\nI did make some mistakes: 1. I remember cutting them back probably too short, but I thought it was going to be fine. 2. Since I've been busier than usual, I accidentally left nail polish on all my toenails for over a month. 3. I do have to wear (always fresh) socks and closed shoes a lot (I usually have my comfortable sport shoes on) and this year so far I've walked about 60-70 km a month on average, so there might be some unavoidable extra pressure on my feet.\nThere's no pain in my toes (only occasionally in my whole feet after a longer day, but that goes away the next morning) and no sign of an infection (no pus, no swelling, no smell). There's no numbness in them either, I can feel with them perfectly fine and I don't really see any discoloration although leaving (black) nail polish on for so long could not do any good. I've thought about them becoming ingrown but that usually (for me) occurs at the corner of the nails and I always feel pressure when that happens (I treat it immediately and it doesn't happen often, maybe twice a year).\nI can't seem to find anything online about non-growing nails without pain and without numbness so I definitely will have to wait to see the podiatrist... Also recently had a blood test which came out nearly perfect (I had slightly higher iron levels, but according to my doctor it is perfectly fine, just means that I've consumed more iron-rich food than what my body needed).\nIs there anything you would recommend me to do while waiting for my appointment?\nI don't know very much about proper feet care, so far I've just thought about some epsom salt baths for them, trying to rest my feet without socks and maybe some massage to aid proper blood flow."""

In particular, I swing left and the tee box next to me was being used by a right-swinging golfer.\n\nWithin a short time of being there, I was struck in the head by the other golfer\'s driver. Fortunately, I was swinging at the exact same time and there was a ""clink"" noise, indicating that our drivers hit together and my driver took some of the impact out of his swing.\n\nI thought I was perfectly fine after but very quickly realized I needed to leave. My boyfriend later informed me that I was incredibly dazed and out of it. I immediately had a bad headache, nausea, and felt like I was going to vomit (but never did). The driving range didn\'t even have an ice pack, so I iced i about 30 minutes later at the hospital. The hospital was jammed pack and I left without seeing someone after several hours. My bf woke me up throughout the night to check on me.\n\nI\'m fairly sure I\'m concussed. I have a history of head trauma (concussions from sports when younger and post-traumatic headache disorder diagnosed by a neurologist as a result of an MVA).\n\nWhat I am perplexed about, and what brings me to this thread is the following: I did not develop a goose egg on my head where I was hit. That night, the spot wasn\'t even sore to touch. Saturday and today the spot has been very tender and there may be mild swelling or a little indent, but there is nothing glaringly obvious. Does this tell me anything about the likely severity of any internal damage? I should also note that I have been experiencing other tender spots on the same side of my head, but I was not struck in those places. This includes the back of my right temple and the back right side of my head. I was struck on the right side about two inches above my ear.\n\nCurrent symptoms: The above mentioned tenderness, headaches, light/noise sensitivity (I know, I need to not be on my laptop..), some nausea, and trouble regulating my emotions (very irritable).'"

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12w533c/chronic_exertional_compartment_syndrome/,b'Chronic Exertional Compartment Syndrome',"b'Hi there, 27 M here. Im 58 and 77kg which, according to BMI, puts me as overweight, but I have a fair bit of muscle from regular weight training over the past 7 years. I also have high arched feet. For all my life as long as I can remember, I have struggled with any sort of distance walking. After about 10 minutes of walking (less if on an incline or at a faster pace) both of my lower legs become extremely tight, painful and rock hard. I also experience foot drop and a slight numbness in my feet. To add to this, I also get hot and sweaty when doing this sort of (what should be) low intensity exercise. My Apple Watch always informs me that I have a low VO2 max - 32.4 at my last measurement - and a walk does feel like it takes a lot of energy from me. My heart rate during a walk can rise up to 130 bpm if walking up a hill. \n\nWhen I stop walking it takes about 10-15 minutes for the pain and sensation in my legs and feet to go away completely. But, what I tend to find is that if I continue walking after this rest, I then generally do not experience the same problem. Its almost as if my legs are ok after that initial swell and once completely rested are good to go for hours afterwards. I guess my legs reset then when not using them for a long period (in bed) as Id have the same problem the following day.\n\nFor example, I recently did some walking in the Yorkshire dales. Initially, walking along the country roads I experienced my usual symptoms and needed to stop walking after about 10 minutes. After a rest, I was fine for the rest of the day. I did end up coming off the road and onto grass which I have found is less of a problem as theres less of an impact with each step, but in normal everyday life I cant avoid hard pavements. My heart rate was still higher than I think it probably should be for my age, but I guess because I dont do a lot of cardio, because of my compartment syndrome, perhaps my cardiovascular system isnt quite up to scratch? \n\nAnother example: I tried skiing recently. The ski boots force your feet into a certain position (if youve skied youll know what I mean) and after about 20 minutes, my calves and feet were in a lot of pain, just from standing in the boots. I think this was the compartment syndrome but could it also be from my high arches and the weight distribution. I didnt do any more skiing after that sadly. \n\nA few years ago, I went to a doctor and they advised me to take ibuprofen before walking to reduce the swelling and that did work for while. But ibuprofen isnt very effective for me now. Are there any other anti inflammatory medications that I could take fairly regularly before I walk out of the house? Obviously its not ideal to be on a regular medication but Id rather avoid a fasciotomy (if thats what the doctor would recommend). I d have tried shoe inserts in the past but they havent helped much.\n\nId be grateful for any advice on all this. It really does impact my life on a daily basis. Id like to be able to go for a long walk or even a run without it being such a big deal! Thanks for any help, its much appreciated.'"

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13x31s3/tiredness_dizzy_spell_postwalk_across_america/,b'Tiredness + Dizzy Spell Post-Walk Across America',"b'Age: 40\n\nSex: Male\n\nHeight: 6\'7""\n\nWeight: 220\n\nI\'ve been feeling tired the past week but especially in the last couple of days. Even when I eat, I end up just feeling tired and hungry again soon. Considering the details below, I figured my body is having trouble adjusting to post-walk living in some way. I\'ve been keeping up with 5-10 mile daily walks for general fitness (I was doing 15-20 miles/day) and went to the gym yesterday. But today I just felt exhausted, more than once, and had to sit for a rest.\n\nI stopped at a grocery store today to grab a bite to eat and felt like a hard cider (I\'m not a frequent drinker and haven\'t had alcohol in several months). My mouth felt dry near the end of my meal. Even after finishing a swig of cider to wet it. What felt like an alcohol buzz became dizziness then me barely holding onto consciousness. I started trembling and soaking myself and the table in a cold sweat. It lasted maybe 5 minutes? Hard to say as I was entirely spaced out and barely there. I almost fell out of my chair. I asked someone to bring me water and said I was about to pass out. I was super thirsty and downed it. And then a couple more cups. My throat started feeling sore/burning; I tried feeling it for swollen lymph nodes. I don\'t think so but I\'m not a doctor. It felt more like it had something to do with my salivary glands. Once they started flowing again the sensation left but it took a few minutes.\n\nIt felt like there was some faint nausea so I went to the toilet but nothing came out and there was no further GI upset. My urine didn\'t look super concentrated but I was very active today. I\'ve been thirsty all day but I hit water fountains constantly as I walked around town.\n\n**Background**: I had to halt an attempted walk across the USA last week. I spent 3 months walking on rural roads and did 1000 miles walking from Florida to Texas. I was doing great but I started having insomnia spells when I hit Texas three weeks ago. I\'ve had insomnia for years, btw. The humidity and heat made it impossible to sleep outside - and even when I\'d get a hotel it would take days for me to recover. So I had to end my adventure. I\'ve had a couple insomnia spells since I quit so I\'m still playing catchup on sleep. Faintly tired most of the time as I haven\'t fully erased my sleep debt but functional.\n\nAlso worth mentioning that I had been bitten on the leg by a tick maybe 3-4 weeks ago. The bite shows no swelling, spots, or bullseye but it does still itch faintly. I removed the tick before it was able to swell up with blood.\n\nThe calf in my **opposite** non-bitten leg has been sore ever since I stopped walking for some reason. Walking makes it fade but when I stop the soreness returns. Feels like it\'s more sore since it started up.\n\nI took a CVS COVID test just now and it was negative.\n\nDrank a lot of water before and after getting a Lyft to my place and feel okay now. What should I do? Not sure how serious all of this is and I feel fine now, if still sore in my calf. Dehydration spell? Exhaustion from lack of sleep?\n\nI\'m out of state right now from my Medicaid coverage and sort of homeless so medical care is complicated and likely expensive. But I also don\'t wish to die, so...\n\nEDIT: [Included photos](https://imgur.com/a/iiv0f5v) of the tick bite area. Does it look like a proper tick eschar? Or just a scar from all the scratching I did? Still itches faintly if I touch it after 3-4 weeks of being bitten. It isn\'t swollen and the tick wasn\'t latched on long enough to swell before I removed it.'"

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13rouih/too_many_diagnoses_ive_completely_lost_faith_in/,"b""Too many diagnoses. I've completely lost faith in medicine. What is actually going on?""","b'F34, 70kg. \n\nI was diagnosed with hEDS in 2017. A full genetic panel was done, but nothing found for the other types. I\'m a 9 on the Beighton scale and have all the classic features of it. My dislocations aren\'t that painful. The xrays of all my joints show a lot of spacing and not a lot of cartilage. There is often blood in the joints when I have had tobattend a&e for help with relocations when I cant manage it myself. I can dislocate pretty much any joint on command and relocate it without much fuss. I had a bad climbing accident in 2020 where I decked out from over 20m breaking both scapulas, sustained a scoliosis, smashed up my pelvis and wound up with a traumatic brain injury.\n\nSince then, here is a list of diagnoses I\'ve been stomped with:\n\nPure autonomic failure (following a 48hr holter monitor for repeated SVTs requiring me to go to a&e). Treatment ivabridine and betablockers.\nPOTS - which I don\'t understand, surely this is just PAF? Why does it need a whole other diagnosis? Treatment - high salt, high fluids (orally)\nUrinary retention - again, is this not just PAF? Urodynamics showed something to do with detruser underactivity. Treatment - self catheterisation. Previous SPC.\nOccipital neuralgia - never an issue until the climbing accident. Treatment - head tilts and sympathetic noises.\nChiari malformation - mri. Can\'t tilt head back without pain/vision being affected. Treatment - don\'t look up.\nScoliosis - dx via xray. Happened at height of covid pandemic when trauma/orthopedics weren\'t working. Treatment - try stretching out to see if it makes a difference.\nThoracic outlet syndrome - dx via ultrasound. Treatment - none.\n\nArms keep falling out of sockets (unsure of medical term) - been on waiting list to have both shoulders replaced for 3yrs now. One to be done, then the other 6mths later. Consequences of not having surgery - constant pins and needles down arms into hand/fingers. Painful pulling/tugging sensation when going from sitting to standing. Could be due to the TOS or PAF, but it feels like my arms are threatening to fall out.\nRaynauds - recommended treatment are compression gloves. More of an issue in colder months. \n2 broken scapulas - never treated. Slings offered, but to be fair with my pelvis being screwed and my spine being rearranged at the time, they didn\'t hurt too much in comparison, so I didn\'t take what felt like a prescription straight jacket.\nUnilateral blue nipple discharge- cause unknown. Discharged from breadt clinic with a shrug.\nGERD - a misdiagnosis. I don\'t have acid reflux. I regurgitate my food like a mammy bird. Taking cyclizine before meals helps keep it down, but moving around causes that food to slide right back up for a second or third chew. Gross, I know, but it\'s how it is. \nGastrointestinal goodness knows - I eat around 3000ish kcals daily to maintain my weight with a now sedentary lifestyle. My bowel motions are yellow, mucousy stuff with plenty of undigested foods in there. Resembles oddly coloured vomit.\nPCOS - due to growing a moustache and beard since age 14. Never any evidence of actual cysts on ovaries with ultrasound. Not overweight. Not insulin resistant afaik. Regular periods and 2 children. Another misdiagnosis?\nPMDD - This is hands down the most debilitating issue when hell week arrives. One week before I bleed, I am a sobbing wreck. Fatigue worsens. Suicidal thoughts creep in. Treatment - ssri. Outcome - I\'ve a propensity towards serotonin syndrome which I\'ve had twice, onelce requiring hospital admission for 3 days.\nHips - awaiting both replacements. I can still walk, but to be fair, the tachycardia sits my ass down before my hips do. Constant pain, mostly in left one, red splotchy hot rashes that develop on hips, but disappear when the pain subsides. Treatment - codeine phosphate/palexia. Opiates make me itch like someone has put me in a bath of fleas, so despite daily prescription for both, I take them once or twice a month when I am at the end of my tether with pain/immobility. Can\'t use crutches given by physio because my shoulders are shit and my heart is bowels. \nDVT, varicose veins and spider veins in legs - given compression stockings, but ingrown and flat growing hairs cause crazy pimples which I cannot for the life of me resist addressing since I let it go for a few weeks last year and ended up with multiple abcesses on calves. \nOedema - cankles. Compression stockings don\'t help with this. Instead they seem to encourage the fluid to form a donut  type shape around my ankle and increased feet swelling. Furosemide prescribed, which helped, but later not prescribed as ""I was too young"".\n\nOther crap - lipoprotein (a) levels 431 nmol/l. First stroke last year at 33. Suspected stroke last month, awaiting mri results, but have an urgent appointment with neuro vasculature next week, so I\'m guessing there\'s something up? Nobody tells me anything. We don\'t get our own results in the NHS and are kept like mushrooms (in the dark and fed on shit).\n\nUsual blood results are unremarkable afaik, except the fact that my crp levels stay low, even with ongoing infection (I had viral meningitis in 2015 and my crp level was grand. I was in ICU, but according to my crp levels, I was ready to take on the world.\n\nMy quality of life has declined massively over the past few years. My health is rubbish. After I got diagnosed with hEDS, I completely rejected the diagnosis, because surely if I had a connective tissue disorder, they could test for it. I responded to this information by taking up powerlifting and competitive rock climbing. Powerlifting resulted in a few fascia tears, torn ligaments etc. Yoga was easy peasy, but killed both MCL/ACLs. Was given braces. Chose to take up rock climbing stead, then I got dropped by a distracted belayer after topping out a route. \nI\'ve since started slowly accepting my diagnosis (ish), but not all this crap that comes with it. I used to be so fit and capable, but now I can\'t walk more than 2 or 3 minutes at a snails pace before my heart rate goes from a solid 60, to 160+.\n\nI\'m not sure that I\'ve been diagnosed properly. If I have, the treatments aren\'t working and I\'m getting worse. I have no faith in doctors at all.\nMy heart attack was labelled a panic attack and I was sent home from a&e, only to get a call in the middle of the night to tell me to come back because my teoponin was high. I told the doctor I felt better and to fuck off, I\'d enough gaslighting for one day and would follow up with my cardiologist. \nThe stroke - I was told I was having a migraine and that was the cause of the facial droop, slurred speech and headache etc. GP referred me to a private hospital for an MRI. MRI showed I had a stroke. \n\nI\'m depressed. I\'m exhausted. I\'m sick of being sore and frustrated at how much of an old woman I\'ve turned into since the accident. A slow stroll gives me angina ffs. If I hadn\'t had the accident and was able to keep up that level of cardiovascular fitness, would I be OK right now? How do I get back to that level? Not just for my physical health, but my mental health. I\'m really struggling right now and my inability to be a functional human has taken its toll on everything. I\'ve not been able to work for over a year. I\'m always exhausted. Not just exhausted, but you know that burning eyeball, verge of tears, everything hurts, my bones are too heavy exhaustion? I\'m sleeping around 14hrs a day. \n\nI\'m on 14 different daily medications, and a further 6 PRN ones. I\'m crap at managing my pain because opiates make me itch to the point I\'d rip my skin off and diclofenarse (100mg diclofenac suppositories) are awful to use because I have tearing in my poop shute (transanal ultrasound last year due to bleeding - unknown cause).\n\nThe house (my body) is on fire and there\'s no escape. I\'m in constant pain. I\'m so frustrated. I don\'t know how to help myself and the NHS in the north of Ireland has buckled. I\'m not sure where the line is between complications of untreated injuries and health issues are and actual deterioration. It feels like new issues are coming up all the time. \n\nCurrently seeing a therapist who has diagnosed medical PTSD.

What are my next steps?'","b""Hi everyone,\n\nI'm hoping to get some input on what my next steps are. My medical history is a bit long and complex, but I'll try to make it as concise as possible.\n\nI am an Asian female in my mid 20's. 5'2 and approx. 150 lbs. Socially drink, no drugs, but take allergy and prescription anti-anxiety medications. In the US.\n\nAbout 6 years ago, I discovered a lump inside my left cheek that continued to grow and swell that eventually progressed to my right cheek, making my cheeks swell up on both sides. After many months, extensive testing, multiple specialists, and a biopsy, I was diagnosed with lupus panniculitis and started treatment. After starting treatment, the swelling and lump went away and things were stable for 6 years.\n\nIn the middle of 2022, I discovered a lump growing in my left cheek again. I suspected it was a recurrence of the lupus panniculitis, but my doctors disagreed, and they were concerned about lymphoma. Since then, I have had **3 biopsies** of the lump and a lymph node FNA biopsy (as CT/MRI imaging has shown enlarged lymph nodes). All of the pathology reports have shown a **reactive lymphoid process**. They have done testing to rule out lymphoma (such as T- and B-cell rearrangement studies), which have not shown any evidence of lymphoma. Unfortunately, all of my specialists, which include dermatology and rheumatology, are not sure of what could possibly be causing this reactive process.\n\nThey suggested waiting a couple months to repeat imaging to see if it has progressed. However, I can feel the lumps getting bigger and I know that it is progressing. The specialists I am seeing are with a teaching hospital, so they are very knowledgable and trying very hard to figure out what my diagnosis is. However, I don't think I can wait anymore. This has been growing since middle of last year and I need answers.\n\nI was wondering if any specialists on this subreddit had any suggestions on any specialty hospitals I could go to for consult. Or any suggestions on what I can possibly do at this point. I can also answer any questions regarding my situation if that is helpful."""

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13mndmx/longterm_pinky_toe_swelling_with_pain/,b'Long-term pinky toe swelling with pain',"b""My (F20, 5'4, 170lb, white, toe swelling, \\~1 year duration, drink alcohol occasionally, vape nicotine) left pinky toe has been swollen, with slight pain when pressure is applied to it, for almost a year. It took me a while to go to a podiatrist for it (about 2 months ago) because I was almost certain I had just been wearing shoes that were too tight. However, when I was working from home for a few months and hadn't been wearing work sneakers or close-toed shoes really at all, I found that there was no change in my toe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are images of my feet: [https://imgur.com/a/0Ewz4zW](https://imgur.com/a/0Ewz4zW) (the photos on the left are the foot I'm concerned about)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I went to the podiatrist, he examined my feet, and said I have hammer toes in my pinky toes (I believe this was after an x-ray.) This explained why they were turned to the side, but they had been like that all my life, so that wasn't one of my concerns. He applied slight pressure to my swollen toe a few times, and I told him it didn't hurt. In my own time, though, I found that only pressure of a certain degree at certain angles caused pain (unlike my other pinky toe, which I felt no pain at all with the same levels/angles of pressure.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had one other question for him, and it was about my second toe. Around the same time I noticed the issue with my pinky toe (I think I saw the issue w/ the second toe first... but my memory is really bad :p) I noticed that my second toe, on the same foot, looked strange. The white border of the toenail was no longer a solid line and looked really uneven. Before I really looked at my toenails, I noticed that my second toes (mostly the left one) hurt after a shift at work in my sneakers. It also hurt when pressure was applied to it, so I went to Google and assumed that my nail bed was separating from trauma (I could see white stuff underneath the nail, like the images in some of those cases showed.) My work shoes felt too tight around the area of the second toe, and my left foot is a liiiitle bit bigger than the right one. So, I assumed this issue was because my shoes were too tight as well. I also disregarded fungus because I thought it was strange that it would only appear on the same toe on both feet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe podiatrist had an x-ray done on my foot, and found nothing wrong with it. He said it might be fungus, and that I should just buy a fungus treatment from CVS to see if it'll go away. I put this on the back-burner unintentionally and haven't started that... But he also said that he found it strange that my left pinky toe was swollen and more turned while the right one was normal. He suggested that I could get an MRI to give me a peace of mind, and he booked the appointment for me. A couple days later they called me and told me it would be $480 because it wasn't covered by my insurance. I ended up cancelling that appointment because it was way too much for me, and I haven't thought about it much since a few days ago. However, I've been sitting at my desk way more recently and have barely gone out/walked around (and I've just been wearing loose Crocs when I do!!!) for a month, and there has definitely been no improvement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is: Should I be concerned about this? Should I get an MRI? And/or should I just try a fungal treatment for a couple months because maybe that's all it is?"""

My boyfriend is into heavy metal music. He is a 21M, white, around 510. We are from the US. He has no existing health issues and does not smoke or use drugs. \n\nHe does the whole violent head bagging thing when listening to music. He doesnt just do it moderately either, I watched him yesterday and it look really violent and vigorous and he shook his head in this manner in all directions. Today he is complaining about sore neck and back as well as feeling a bit off. I know infants can get brain swelling from being shook. Can this happen to adults? Can we generate enough momentum to cause brain damage from violently shaking our head?  Or does it sound like he just strained his muscles?'"

The pain radiates from his groin shooting down his leg, as well as up to his chest. He hasnt been able masturbate regularly since this all started, in fact it actually causes him debilitating pain despite doctors saying masturbation shouldnt cause pain. This is also accompanied by severe UTI-like symptoms except he has never tested positive for any sort of bacteria or infection throughout these 6 months. It can get so bad that hell be in the bathroom trying to urinate once every ten minutes. Sometimes blood in urine and stool, also leakage of semen uncontrollably in the morning that causes burning pain when hes urinating. \n\nThe swelling is the most debilitating part for him because it causes a very uncomfortable pain. The only way to soothe it is by getting in quick cold showers. He also describes the swelling as sagging or drooping and it gets much worse at night or when hes trying to go to bed. He does think his testicles look and feel abnormal to how they always were throughout his life, doctors dont agree though. \nHydrocele and inguinal hernia was what an ER doctor finally was able to diagnose him with but it was quickly taken back by his urologist. Hes been misdiagnosed with a hernia 2-3 times now. \n\nFrom what my boyfriend tells me he believes it was a physical change in his testicles or injury that first caused all of this. When he was walking to the store he says they felt like they shifted out of position (or something) and since then these symptoms have been progressively getting worse and worse. \n\nA little more insight is he kinda had a vyvanse (adderall) dependency for a bit and he was using them regularly before this injury, as well as alcohol and marijuana. I just want to provide anything possibly relevant because this has left him so hopeless and truly effected his quality of life. \n\nWeve had multiple CT scans, ultrasounds, all came back normal. There was the concern of hydrocele and cysts reported by our last ER doctor but the urologist completely dismissed this as an issue. \nThe only thing we havent done is an MRI and camera up the butt to see if its cancer. \nI dont know if its just Houston doctors but hes been treated in a dismissive way throughout this whole thing by urologists, they even told him he just needs to go out and exercise despite him being in debilitating chronic pain.\n\nIf yall have any advice or have gone through something similiar we are begging at this point.

Saw a geneticist last year and recently got a letter from her saying that my closest match is 'Hypermobile Ehlers Danlos' however I do not meet the criteria for hEDS. Been having strange symptoms my entire life, half of which are neurological.""","b""I've been having weird symptoms for my entire life pretty much, one of the first weird symptoms for me was that my elbow dislocated when I was five after I was playing and hanging from my mom and dad's arms. I had to go to the ER, have an x ray done on my elbow. my elbow was halfway up my bicep and the doctor had to distract me while he forced it back into place. i remember being in tons of pain. I bruise really easily and when I was 13 I had some sort of 'stroke like event' which left temporary gliosis on my brain. strokes dont run in my family so they said its very unusual for someone so young to have an event like that.\n\nwhen I was maybe 17 or 18 I began to get weird neurological symptoms. the first symptom was tinnitus which improved when i layed flat. it'd go away within a few minutes but as the years went by it got worse and took longer periods of lying flat to get rid of it. first thing in the morning it'd be completely gone, I even plugged my ears with my fingers to make sure and all I could hear was blood flowing through my ears.\n\nIn 2013 my heart problems began, out of the blue.. heart rate of 280 beats per minute, had to go to the ER again where I was prescribed Verapamil. echogram of my heart was normal so they said maybe I have extra nodes and such. my heart rate gets gradually more unstable the longer im upright, it followed a similar pattern to the tinnitus. in 2018 i started to get even more weird neurological symptoms including muscle twitches, really sharp stunning headaches, and brain fog. all these symptoms when they first started would be gone in the morning but worst in the evening and at night. lying down made them better. My symptoms are now there all the time and may improve a little with sleeping through the night but not completely.\n\nWhen I stand up my blood pressure shoots through the roof and so does my heart rate. when I'm lying down my blood pressure is around 100/50, but as soon as i stand up it immediately shoots up to 150/108 and my pulse goes from 70 to 140. Some days are worse than others.\n\nI saw a geneticist almost a year ago since I have hypermobility, bilateral piezogenic papules, crowded palate and joint instability. the geneticist recently sent me a letter saying that the closest match is hypermobile Ehlers Danlos but I don't meet the criteria for it.\n\nI've had every test imaginable, neurologists thought I had a csf leak which was causing my symptoms but my MRI scans were normal. I did however have two blind epidural blood patches which didnt help me. I'm a 29 year old white female of European descent and I am taking Verapamil for my heart problems and Mirtazapine and Temazepam to sedate me and help me to sleep as my symptoms would be unbearable without."""

(Eating like rubbish)   \n  and i never go outside. (i\'m pale.)   \n  and my sleep routine is horrible.   \n\n\n  \n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n\n\n  \nSo basically, my dad died back in 2019. From lung cancer. I was 10 at the time, and I already knew he was gonna. You know. And after he died. I couldn\'t really believe it? but the grief didn\'t click in, until September / November, of 2019. But then at the time, I started going through really stressful, things like, bullying. Name-calling. Harassment. (These had happened online. I know it may not seem like such a big deal but it ruined my self-confidence, and mental health.) And it got worse in 2020, because I got abused online as well And my mental health, got worse to the point where I had urges to kill / harm myself, (I hardly have them anymore, which I\'m glad about.) Family issues? Stressing, and constant crying\n\n  \n \\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\n\n  \n (The reasons why I\'m saying this, is because it could explain why I\'m dealing with the stuff I\'m about to put down.)   \n\n\n  \n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n\n\n  \nDecember, 8th, 2020, was the time I got sick.   \n\n\n  \n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n\n\n  \nIt was in my stomach, and I though ""oh I\'m just sick it will pass"", but it just got worse. And it would keep, growling, and I lost my appetite fully and didn\'t even wanna eat. But the thing I realised was that I was stressed / worried about it. Because I though it was stomach cancer. (Still do.) And it would make me feel like I was gonna throw up,   \n\n\n  \nAnd in 2021. I still had. It. No appetite still, no nothing. Just feeling sick. But I still ate, and drank everyday. But online stuff happened again. (Which I think made it worse? I don\'t know. And my mental health worse.) But then I started thinking my stomach was gonna collapse. And I started worrying more about it.   \n\n\n  \n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n\n\n  \nAnd in this year, same stuff. With my stomach. But in April 2022. I had a panic attack? I also had left arm aches / pains. So basically went downstairs, and told my mum about it. And we started talking, about stuff. And i stood up from the chair, and then all sudden, my head started feeling SUPER weird. And I said ""mum my head feels weird!"" And she said ""your probably having a panic attack."" And then i started panicking, and said ""mum, mum I think I\'m dying!!"" And I went down on to the kitchen floor.and my brother said ""your fine."" And my mum said ""this is because of your dad."" And then she went to open the door for me to get air. And I still felt weird. And my hands were shaking. (I can\'t remember but I think my mouth /lips was dry.) But the thing is I felt like I was forcing the shaking. Because I was making myself shake (but again I probably wasn\'t. I did not do it for attention, I know that would of been bad. etc I was seriously scared, that I was gonna die in front of my mum and brother.) . But when I stopped my body felt like nothing. And my breathing was a bit weird a swell. And my mum was trying to talk me out of it. And then a few minutes later, I went to stand up, and go upstairs, but my whole body, and legs felt weird. Very weird. But then I felt the whole night, watching tiktok to distract myself. But then next day, my mum told my older brother that I was having panic attacks. That same day, I felt like I was freak, out and call an ambulance, because I felt like I was going to die. And I was worrying about my health. (Still do.)   \n\n\n  \n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n\n\n  \nOLD SYMPTOMS.   \n\n\n  \n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n  and i am also getting forgetfulness.  \n    \n  feeling like something is in my throat for a few minutes,    \n and feeling sweaty,(doesn\'t last long.) when i panic over something.   \n stuttering.   \n headaches.   \n weird head feelings.    \n and weird feeling slightly under my stomach by my hips.   \n dry mouth / lips sometimes.   \n and feeling like i will gag? on my foods / drinks.   \n no appetite.   \n stomach growling.   \n constantly seeking reassurance.   \n heart fluttering, and dropping.  \n \\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n\n\n  \nMY NEW SYMPTOMS THIS YEAR.   \n\n\n  \n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n stomach growling, even tho im not hungry. and it makes me have a sick feeling. (Still have.)   \n feeling a fuzzy feeling at the side of my face. (It feels like he fuzzy ealing you get in your hands sometimes.)   \n still no appetite.   \n constantly feeling strange. (Like I might die, or something will happen inside my body and ill die.)   \n forgetfulness. (Still have.)   \n hair falling out, slightly. (Just smallish.)   \n weird cold chills at my back and arms. (The slight weird cold chill you get when you\'re sick, or something.)   \n constantly seeking reassurance.   \n weird breathing. (Like when you walk around and your breathing gets heavy in a way.)   \n my heart sometimes making a dropping feeling, and it beats again.  \n \\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n\n\n  \nAnd my symptoms kept changing.  \n   \n\n\n  \nAnd now this year, my symptoms have changed like they have been.   \n\n\n  \nbut my stomach still keeps growling for no reason I lost my appetite, 2-3 years ago when this started, but I feel weird, like very weird like the weird feelings you get when you feel like you\'re about to end up in a hospital? I can\'t explain my weird feelings, and I feel like I can\'t think straight? But I can? But I keep looming at things without blinking for a few seconds and my face was just been blank? In a way, and I\'m getting weird fuzzy feelings at the side of my face. and I\'m scared I\'m dying, or it\'s an illness. But the weird feelings do go away, but they come back after a few hours, or minutes, I know I need therapy, and help but the waiting lists. I\'m trying to learn to cope with it. Because I know it won\'t go away just by ignoring it, and I know as much as I\'m worried for my health know I been through a lot of stress, etc and now I been going puberty for a couple years.Anxiety feels like a nightmare, and I hate it. I wish I could stop feeling constantly weird, and strange etc. It\'s a very very weird and strange feeling and it\'s odd. I can\'t explain anything.   \n\n\n  \nBut I can\'t keep letting it get the best of me because I will just need to learn, to accept it as much as its hard to. I\'ll just accept it and I\'ll keep telling my mum for therapy or even see a doctor It\'s terrifying but i know I can get through this oll run around my house etc etc etc for distractions etc until I can get a therapist which I know will take long, but I hope I won\'t be like this forever and ever.   \n\n\n  \nAnd I also have a white patch on my tongue it kinds looks like milk? And sometimes I feel a very weird weird feeling that something will happen? And most times I breathe I feel something in my throat lime its my heart beat? Or if my heart skips a beat or something when I breathe sometimes?   \n\n\n  \nBut also a good thing is, is that I can drink and eat fine, and I\'m not in any bad pains at all, I just physically feel weird, and I can\'t explain the feelings. But when I sleep, I wake up In the middle of the night for no reason, so that might be from stress.   \n\n\n  \nDoes anybody else experience or know what I mean? I don\'t know why I keep worrying about my health I constantly seek reassurance and it kinda makes me feel a attention seeker.but i also have this weird cold feeling at my back (the cold feeling you get when you\'re sick?) but i have it at my back, and i don\'t have a lot of symptoms of anxiety and it\'s scaring me. are people different with anxiety and stress? do they have different things with it? because i know everybody is different but i\'m still scared.   \n\n\n  \nhas anybody else had this? i feel like i\'m the only person. i think i actually have a illness or something i just feel sick and strange constantly. but i\'m planning on getting stress/anxiety gummies i\'m terrified.   \n\n\n  \nand i\'m thinking about therapy? but i just wanna take small steps for starters.   \n\n\n  \nand i also never see anybody with this same thing as me so i\'m scared.   \n\n\n  \nand my hear also makes a drop feeling, even when my heart isn\'t racing etc it happens out of nowhere, and it\'s weird, and when i breathed in, i like felt it in my throat? and i just feel awful, and weird constantly, it sucks. it really does suck. i just feel like i\'m gonna die or if i have some type of serious/deadly illness etc, i just want it to stop. i don\'t even have a clue if this is normal or not. i just hope others have, had the same things/thing has me. it sucks i feel alone. it feels like something is wrong inside my body and i can\'t explain it i\'m so sick of it. i feel like i\'m about to die any second.okay my body just did something weird and i think my body just bought something up into my throat? i can\'t explain it i\'m scared. am i okay?   \n\n\n  \nI\'m sorry if I\'m bothering anybody, I know others have more serious problems but I\'m just scared. \n\n  \nshould i change my diet, and sleep routine? and get anxiety/stress gummies from amazon? (they probably won\'t work but i wanna take small steps.)   \n\n\n  \nAnd I think all this has something, to do with my stomach. Because my stomach was the first thing that felt sick back in december 8th 2020, so I don\'t understand. Is my stomach okay? And it also feels like my body might bring something up or something? I don\'t understand why did this happen, so suddenly? Did I do something wrong?  \n \n\n  \nBut even if I am like this I can still eat, and drink fine. (Sometimes feel like I might throw up but yeah, I can eat and drink. But i also have a bad diet, and i eat and drink horribly.) I can still go bathroom, just fine. (Never really any problems with that.) I can still sleep fine. (But I do wake up around 1-2 times. Which is probably stress, but my sleep routine is also horrible.) I can also, walk around fine even tho my legs and body still feel sick, and weird etc.So I don\'t understand what\'s going on? Why am I getting these weird physical symptoms? Because I don\'t know if it is anxiety, or is just from stress or some kind, of trauma? I don\'t know but I feel like this could also be because of my dad dying.   \n\n\n  \n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n \n\n  \nThings that maybe caused this:  \n\n\n  \n \\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n  But maybe it\'s because, I\'m to stressed out?    \n Maybe I have low blood sugar from not eating and drinking well?   \n maybe because I\'m on the Internet 24/7 and I never go outside, and I\'m pale?   \n maybe I\'m not healthy. And I\'m not drinking or eating healthy the way I should?   \n maybe it\'s because I\'m still going through puberty?   \n maybe because of the online bullying? Or my dad\'s death?   \n maybe my bad sleep routine?    \n constant stressing?   \n maybe trauma?  \n \\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n\n\n  \nAnd I know I\'m not the only one. I\'m just scared incase I was because I didn\'t wanna suffer with it alone. If it makes sense   \n But I realozes when I\'m calmed down or something, and then I don\'t feel sick? But still feel a bit strange?  \n I\'m fearing that I might have a stroke due to the fuzzy feeling at the side of my face, or I\'m having a medical problem etc but I\'m trying to stay strong. Even tho it\'s hard and it feels like a nightmare.   \n\n\n  \nAnd I don\'t have any medical problems at all, I\'ve always been healthy, so I don\'t understand why this suddenly happens.'"

Anyways, I\'ve been feeling pretty crappy the last two weeks, and have a noticeable tremor in my hands now. This past week, I\'ve had a racing heart rate intermittently, felt like I was having a panic attack sort of, and a general lightheadedness. Today, I was feeling pretty decent up until a few hours ago. I got up off the couch and started to feel dizzy, but ignored it.\n \nI have a history of low blood pressure and positional vertigo. For the vertigo, I was prescribed zofram prn. Sadly, I can\'t remember where I put it, I think my bottle is at work so I\'m SOL tonight. My vertigo spells are rare but violent. The room spins around me, I struggle to speak, twitch pretty intensely, and sometimes puke. They aren\'t fun, and last for hours. I can\'t sleep, can\'t do anything besides sit there and cry and try not to vomit. \n \nSo, as I\'m making dinner in my kitchen, I start to feel lightheaded and...wrong. A few minutes later, I start to feel like I\'m going to faint so I sit down. It passes, but I still feel wrong. I manage to finish cooking, eat my food on the floor of my living room, and try to lay down. Then the vertigo hits full force. I\'m twitching, nauseous, and want to cry. I lay down, and the spinning/puking goes away until I try to stand up. Suddenly, I feel incredibly hot, the room is spinning, my head is in pain, and I feel like I\'m going to actively puke. So I lay back down. \nAfter a few, I sit back up, experience that whole meds again, and crawl slowly to my bedroom and into bed where I\'m typing this from. \n\nI live alone, with only my sister nearby. She has a newborn, and I really don\'t want to disturb her. She is the only one with a key to my apartment. If I call anyone else, I\'d have to somehow get to my front door and open it, and getting to my bed was hell enough. With my history and my symptoms, should I just wait this out? Or do you all think I need to go to Instacare or the ER? I don\'t think there\'s much they can do for me. Can\'t really afford to call an ambulance, so I\'d rather not do that. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated. I don\'t think this is serotonin syndrome, as I\'ve been on these meds for two weeks.'"

I have posted photos from the multiple stages, see attachments 3-8. \n\nHowever; a few weeks ago she began seeing white worms emerging from the wounds, and more alarmingly moving in her eyes (see Fig. 9 and 10).

She is Canadian, but she has traveled to many places including: Senegal, Brazil, and all over the Caribbean. \n\nOther background: Weve tried everything to get medical help, but as she has Bipolar Disorder going to the ER has resulted in the assumption that she is on drugs and that its all in her head.

My sister had gone out to have dinner and had two alcoholic beverages. Everything was fine and nothing strange or notable happened to her during the meal. While we were on the phone she arrived back to her apartment and had two boxes that had been shipped to her sitting outside the door. \n\nShe opened both boxes with me on the phone. One of them was a handmade plate and the other was a large box of dresses. She was trying on clothing from a subscription service in which you receive ten dresses, choose one, send unwanted dresses back, pay this company dollars. She is texting me as the dresses are being tried on with photos of each one while we are still talking and I hear the phone drop. \n\nI could hear some shuffling noises and then a terrible noise that sounded like a deep honk, the only way I can explain it is that it sounded like a guttural gasp or goose honk. I was yelling her name and then could not hear any movement, nothing. To get to the point (sorry, I can be wordy) I disconnected and then called her back several times. I actually thought someone had broken in, she passed out, etc. \n\nFour minutes elapsed and I finally connected with her, she sounded very sleepy, and a bit confused. She told me that she was unsure what just happened but that her throat had completely closed up and to the best of her ability, she understood she was having an allergic reaction and could not get air in- she was able to tell me that she had been gasping for air and I assume that is what the noise I could hear was. \n\nI called 911; she lives about 30 minutes from me in the county (a rural area) and stayed on the phone with her until they arrived. We spoke with dispatch on a conference call and she took four puffs of her Albuterol inhaler (prescribed one month ago for bronchitis) and one zyrtec (she had no benadryl). \n\nI stayed on the line throughout this experience in which EMS arrived and assisted her, O2 SAT was 100 which they stated was good and likely because she had taken four puffs of her inhaler prior to their arrival. Her pulse was ""normal"" at 98 and BP they stated was a bit elevated. I want to say it was 120/100 but I might be wrong.\n\nNeedless to say, the EMS told my sister that she had experienced an allergic reaction, to the best of their knowledge, was not showing signs and symptoms that she needed hospitalization. I asked her to ask them what could have caused this. She actually brought the dress out that she had tried on and one of the EMS team members stated that they could smell a very strong chemical smell on the dress ""that might have been used to sanitize"". I heard him stated there is no way to identify exactly what this smell was but that it was familiar to him. Another EMS team member then stated he actually has asthma and began to wheeze after taking a sniff of the dress!\n\nNow after reading all of this I want to thank you for making it this far and ask- what do you think this could have been? I will let you know that we are both in the counseling field and planners so she called her primary care doctor this morning to make an appointment and she has also requested to be referred to an allergist. This ordeal was really scary and has us both shaken up. I do not want to say she experienced anaphylactic shock but I know her throat constricted and this happened so suddenly! I want to receive any advice you have. I have tried to include every single detail but will be happy to answer any question. THANK YOU! \n\n(if you are wondering my ""normal"" reddit username is so obviously me and I do not want to identify my sister or her medical diagnoses/history- therefore the post from a throwaway account.'"

I live in upstate NY. I take Syeda, vitamin D, and metoprolol succinate. I am bipolar. \n\nIve taken half a dozen different SSRIs and SNRIs, as well as lithium and lamictal. My GP prescribed lamictal to me a year ago at a low dose after insisting lithium was too dangerous and I titrated slowly the way she instructed. I was doing fine on the lithium for a few months but she said it was a drug of last resort and lamictal is safer. \n\nAfter two weeks I became suddenly severely ill. My lymph nodes swelled, I got a high fever, a rash, pompholyx broke out on my hands, I got oral ulcers, etc. I went to the doc immediately and she thought I had mono and insisted it couldnt be the lamictal. I kept taking it, my body continued to do wacky shit for another month until I saw a rheumatologist who said hey you should really stop taking that.\n\nI saw a rheumatologist because my ANA jacked up and I began having joint pain and photosensitive rashes. It took many months for them to sort of decide I had drug-induced lupus, and those symptoms have faded away, but now my thyroid hormone is steadily increasing and my thyroid antibodies are jacked up over 900. The doctor said technically drug induced lupus wasnt possible but I had the ANA and anti histone antibodies that said I did, so I didnt really get a firm explanation from anyone ever. \n\nNow Im having abdominal pain and weight loss. I lost 5 pounds in two weeks because I can barely eat. I went through the ringer getting my gallbladder looked at which has shown an 8mm polyp but normal HIDA scan. Ive had hemorrhoids for three months that will sort of fade then come right back. \n\nEver since the lamictal I get pompholyx, rashes on my scalp, plus everything else. Theres constantly something. My thyroid hormone was always 1.2-1.5 for years before this, and now its 5, which my doctor says is normal. This really screwed up my life. I became so ill I couldnt work and ended up losing my job, which made me more depressed and worsened the symptomsand then I had no insurance and couldnt afford medication. \n\nI really feel like the lamictal did major damageIm not a doctor so I dont know, but I read AEDs have a very direct relationship with the immune system.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13hd1ix/21f_possible_levothyroxine_drug_eruption_rashes/,b'21F possible Levothyroxine drug eruption rashes',"b'Age: 21 \n\nSex: F\n\nHeight: 53\n\nWeight: 115\n\nRace: Caucasian\n\nI work in dermatology (as a medical assistant; I am in my first year of medical school), and I have already had the physician I work with take a look. I have worked in dermatology for several years now, but I wanted to post on here to ask for a second opinion and another perspective.\n\nSome context: on May 2nd, I began treatment with generic Levothyroxine (dosage 25 mcg). I was recently diagnosed with Hashimotos thyroiditis by my endocrinologist. \n\nOn May 8th, I noticed a few small, tiny, raised rashes on my abdomen; no itching whatsoever. Each following day, I noticed more and more of these tiny little rashes. Today is May 14, and these rashes are now distributed all over my abdomen, back, chest, and neck. There are even a few directly above the groin area. I have never had rashes that look like this before, ever.\n\nMy first thought was cholinergic urticaria. I am tachycardic, and I also take Concerta for my ADHD (I have been on a stable dose of this medication for 3 years now), so I sweat easily with heat. (Before you ask, I have seen a cardiologist recently, and my EKG and echo are normal; I have trace mitral regurg, but that is the only slight abnormality). However, I have never had cholinergic urticaria before, and the rashes are more rash-like than hive-like, and they did not go away within 24 hours. At this point I sent myself hydrocortisone 2.5, and began applying it to the affected areas. \n\nThen, I had the thought that these rashes may be caused by bedbugs. I did a complete search of my bed, bedroom, and apartment, and found no sign of bedbugs (or any other bugs for that matter). Just to be safe, I did a deep clean and disinfection of my entire apartment, mattress, bedding, etc. Also, if the rashes were in fact bedbug bites, they would be extremely itchy (which they are not), and the rashes would have a tiny dark blood spot in the centre, which they do not.\n\nAnd then I realized that the sudden appearance of these mystery rashes all over my body may be related to my Levothyroxine (which is generic T4, not any brand name). The sudden appearance of the rashes coincided with when I started taking Levothyroxine, or more accurately when I had been taking it for about a week or so. \n\n(No, I have not had any contact with any pets, new household products, no new shampoos or soaps either, and we have ruled out ACD).\n\nI reached out to my endocrinologist as soon as I came to the realization that these rashes may be a drug eruption. He informed me that I may be having a reaction to the dyes, fillers, and additives in Levothyroxine, and he sent out a prescription for Tirosint that same day. Tirosint does not contain any of the dyes, fillers, or additives that Levothyroxine, Synthroid, etc contain, and it only has a few ingredients as opposed to many. I did some research, and I found that quite a few patients reported reactions and developed rashes as a side effect of Levothyroxine/Synthroid/other T4 medications containing such ingredients. These patients seemed to do better on Tirosint. My endocrinologist also suggested I see one of the dermatologists that I work with about the rash.\n\nI skipped my Levothyroxine dose for two days, and as of yesterday morning, I took my first dose of Tirosint 25 mcg (my insurance refused to cover it, so it took me some time to actually get the prescription).\n\nYesterday (May 13), I had a dermatologist at my practice take a look at the rashes on my body. She found more on my back that I wasnt aware of. She also did not know what the rashes were, and was extremely puzzled, but she did agree with me at the possibility that they may have been caused by a reaction to the generic Levothyroxine I had been taking. However, she isnt sure, and I have reached out to another dermatologist at my practice for her opinion as well.\n\nI have attached three photos of the rashes below. The first is of my abdomen, the second is of my neck (I have coloured over my collarbone tattoo for anonymity), and the third is of my chest (the two pimple-like bumps in the middle of the rashes are benign and I have had them since childhood). Every day I find more and more of these rashes on my body, and since they do not seem to be resolving, I am looking for another opinion as to what they are, what may be the cause of them, and how I should go about treating them. The sudden appearance of these rashes is extremely upsetting and stressful. Summer is here, and I cannot be dealing with mystery rashes all over my body right now; it is devastating.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/S2ObZ3H'"

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/r4wcc3/could_me_being_drugged_years_ago_change_my/,b'Could me being drugged years ago change my reaction to alcohol or does my aging body just hate me?',"b'**tldr:** I think I might have been date rape drugged a few years ago, now I\'m wondering if that could cause me to have memory loss after drinking (booze).\n\n**Basic info:**\n\nI am 23F, living in a northern European country (as such, English isn\'t my first language, soz). I am 175cm (5\'9""?) and 102kg (225lbs). I have never taken any drugs, but I do take escitalopram for my depression. I also use alcohol recreationally and have been since I was 18 (Europe).\n\n**Situation now:**\n\nIf I drink more than 3-4 units of strong alcohol (e.g. 4cl of vodka mixed with soda), I often have problems recalling things the next day. As obvious as this is, I don\'t have the same problem when I drink things like beer or wine, even if I drink more. E.g. I might drink a bottle of wine and a few beers during the evening, be as or more drunk as with booze, but have no problems with remembering the next day. In general I\'d say I have a pretty high tolerance, drinking 4-5 units or a bottle of wine gets me somewhat buzzed, but not very drunk.\n\n**Backstory:**\n\nThis isn\'t a problem that I\'ve always had, I had my first severe episode of it two years ago when i was visiting Germany. I was drinking booze in our hostel\'s common area with some friends and some guys we had just met. When I woke up in my bed the next morning, I was told my friends had found me passed out on the floor in the hostels shared bathroom. They had great difficulty in waking me and and I was barely conscious when awake, and just vomited severely. In the morning I couldn\'t remember any of it, my memory went completely blank after a certain point in the evening and I never recovered any of the memories from that night. In the morning I felt somewhat hungover. \n\nAfter a year or so, when I thought about the incident, I started to find it really weird. I had gotten way too drunk before as well, but had never experienced anything like that. I have never before or since passed out anywhere but my bed or a sofa and previously had had no problems with losing my memory. After discussing it with the friends I was drinking with that night, they also found what happened pretty uncharacteristic of me, as we had also partied together many times before. We came to the conclusion that I might have been drugged by the seemingly friendly strangers we spent time with that evening. I had no signs that I had been sexually assaulted in any way, and I have no reason to believe that I was. Maybe because I was fortunate enough to pass out in the ladies\' bathroom and a male might have found it awkward to follow me there as someone could have walked in at any time. Or maybe I just got really drunk and blacked out. Who knows, I have no evidence.\n\nHowever, after this incident, I started to have problems with remembering the nights when I would drink booze. I find it really scary to be honest.\n\n**Actual question:**\n\nMy ""problem"" is solved easily enough, I have already have chosen to quit drinking booze, and I am thinking of quitting alcohol altogether. Right now I am simply curious. Could me being drugged have this long time effect or is it simply that my body\'s reaction to alcohol has changed? That seems reasonable enough too.\n\nThank you, hopefully this wasn\'t too long and boring :)'"

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/11xucd8/left_foot_has_worsening_purple_toes_initially_had/,"b'Left foot has worsening purple toes, initially had bright red inflammation 2-3 months ago'","b'Picture below. I\'ve had this issue for a few months now. I saw a doctor ~2 months ago and the issue has worsened in ways (left foot much more purple) and better in others (right foot not dealing with much discoloration if any)- they provided a few things it could be (reynauds, chillblains, diabetes, and some others i forgot) but I need testing to find out what it actually is. I cannot afford to spend really anything near what these tests cost but may be able to do whichever test seems most probable or indicative soon. My marketplace insurance doesn\'t cover blood testing until i meet a copay i dont have a chance of meeting. I will provide as much information as I can and let me know any questions I missed. The primary issue is my left foot having, what appears to be, very low blood flow in particular but my other foot/fingers are a bit colder than usual. Right foot has been paleish/purpleish especially when I saw the doctor 2 months ago but never as bad as the left included in pictures.\n\nParticularly the left foot has had the worst part of the issue for the 3~ months it\'s been ongoing. At this point, all of the toes are generally a little purple and there have been times they don\'t blanch at all.  My right foot sometimes seems inverse of this, but very rarely / not sure if it has happened since 2 months ago is also a little purple on the right side / right pinky toe. Currently the right foot is generally white and looks fine but still cold at the toes. I just put my feet under some warm water and the left foot gets red but the right almost turns whiter, brighter not pale.\n\nThe issue did seem worse around the time I saw the doctor, with my fingers having more profound coldness and issues with purple/paleness on the right foot. But my left foot didn\'t have nearly as many/much purple toes. Initially my left foot, 1st toe to the left of the big toe, would get sort of inflamed. Appears like fluid retention from my general research, gets red and a little itchy / sensitive , not super swollen but possibly swells a little? Looks like ""covid toes"" that I had seen. I still get this on my fingers randomly which dissipates quickly, where some fingers are red around the nail and it\'s a little more sensitive. I feel like this occurs a lot when I leave my apartment, now that I think about it. I have not had much pain aside from the early red toes/current occasional red fingers which is still pretty minor pain. No pain on the feet or anywhere else really, aside from the hemorrhoid(s) i had/have. If I excerise or run it under warm water it does blanch a little, but if I try it when I\'m at my desk sometimes it doesn\'t blanch at all. I haven\'t really lost feeling anywhere on my body, it doesn\'t usually get numb but every now and then. Doctors did check blood flow to my foot, seemed fine. I visited urgent care for a hemorrhoid and asked them to take a look as well, and they checked the flow to my foot which appeared fine and didn\'t deem the issue urgent to take any further steps. Color is restored pretty quickly upon excerise, warm water, or raising my feet. My foot looks practically normal if I just do any of those things, but gets back to purple/pale quickly if I sit. Unsure about Reynauds as a cause because my limited understanding of Reynauds is that it isn\'t constant like this, more so a reaction. My feet have never really been itchy, only a little when they were initially inflamed. Again, I have not really had much pain anywhere at all which a lot of causes seem to have. \n\nMy background: I believe my blood mother had blood pressure issues but it\'s unclear. I have psoriasis, I have never been tested for diabetes, I have anxiety/depression, started ADHD medication (adderall) ~4 months ago so around a month before this issue arose - no prior ADHD diagnosis in my family. Wheneve i don\'t take it or do take it, doesnt seem to have an impact but I am going to try skipping it both of my weekend days instead of the usual one and see if there are any changes. I have always had issues with dexterity and feel out of breath quickly, have seen 205 bpm or so on a smart watch when going for a run (smart watch, so who knows). I was obese at that time around 210 I believe. My peak weight was 225 during 2022, but since lost weight and now around 175. Issue probably began when I was around 190. I went from 200 to 175 over a span of 4-5 months I\'d say. All weight measurements in pounds. I work from home and don\'t know anybody here so leave very rarely, have had a pretty sedentary lifestyle for the last 2 or 3 years hence the weight gain. I did run a little when I got here but rarely leave for a run now. I do tend to sit poorly at my desk, with my legs crossed or one up but have been sitting properly the last week or so. I have been sleeping with my feet elevated. My diet is poor as I don\'t have a lot of spare money and struggle with most foods. I don\'t eat any meat right now, have usually eaten a lot of chicken in the past. Could have a minor lactose issue, but not diagnosed as the first time I\'ve seen a primary care doctor was at that visit in Jan. Blood pressure checks appear fine everytime I\'ve been tested. My resting rate is usually 78-85. I\'m a 22 years old 5\'9 ~175lb white male. I did use thc a while back 5 months+ but haven\'t since, never smoked or used tobacco, and don\'t drink. I was taking doxylamine succinate for the past few years but have recently stopped. Only known allergies are from a ""severe drug eruption"" due to Trazodone and recently another skin rash reaction to Quetiapine. Taking mirtazpine since 2 weeks ago, taking fish oil supplemements since a week ago. Have purchased some other supplements (Niacin, B12, Magnesium, Iron, L-argynine). The day after I took Niacin and L-argynine my heart felt weird, believe it was palpitations so haven\'t taken again. \n\nI know this is a lot of information, and it may be an obvious (you need to be active or eat better) to fix the issue. I\'m hoping to confirm that, or if it is something someone has seen before. I really struggle with excerise mainly due to insecurities and how tired it makes me, but have been doing jumping jacks on breaks and such to get my heart moving. It\'s difficult to go for a run when it absolutely exhausts me, went outside for 12 ish minutes total a few days ago and ran as much as I could which was not continous or for a very long period; at most I ran for 20-30s at a time and run out of breath. I had to chill for ~1hr30 afterwards before i could get up and try to play a game. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions or any suggestions, thank you. Photo below.\n\ntldr; unsure of cause of left foot having very purple feet from initially red/inflamed feet; and have limited resources for blood tests to figure it out for sure. Hoping someone has seen this before.'"

The chilblains are gone for the year now.\n\nOver the last few years I seem to be getting gradually worse circulation in my feet, to the extent that if it's even slightly cold outside they will go numb regardless of footwear (with feeling usually coming back after ten minutes of walking), they go blue even in a normally heated house, they are often so cold is painful to touch my feet together, and a meat thermometer shows them as being only a few degrees above ambient temperature. \n\nThe coldness I thought was just bad circulation (a GP once commented that I have very few capillaries in my feet) but the turning blue bothers me.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/123z7d9/trying_to_understand_how_my_brother_died_he/,"b'Trying to understand how my brother died - he ""stiffened up"" after being hit? Official cause of death is prescription drug overdose'","b'I also cross-posted this to r/RBI but I wanted to see if any doctor had experience with addiction, eating disorders and physical health and could offer insight.\n\nMy brother (24m, 6\'3"", 140lbs, white) was a drug addict, in and out of treatment programs/rehab for almost a decade. This past October, he passed away while in a sober living program after an altercation with his roommate. They fought over a sweatshirt, the roommate hit him, and my brother called my mom crying. She said he sounded incredibly upset and was hyperventilating. He was very sensitive and prone to debilitating panic attacks so this was not unusual - she reassured him that she would head over immediately to go see and comfort him and then they hung up (I\'m unclear on whether he had calmed down at that point or not). A staff member at the program went to go check on him - this staff member said my brother was crying in bed, and then started to stiffen up. The staff member thought my brother was overdosing on opioids so he administered Narcan. My brother passed away shortly thereafter.\n\nHowever, this staff member has given conflicting stories on different occasions. We were originally told my brother began seizing after he got hit, but later, in an official report from the sober living program, the staff member described it as ""stiffening up"" rather than seizing. This official report was conducted at my mother\'s request. Also, the staff member **originally told us he administered Narcan twice, and then in the official report wrote that he administered Narcan only once.** I\'m not sure if that distinction really matters or not, which is why I\'m asking here to see if anyone has knowledge about this.\n\nThe coroner said that **there were no illegal drugs in my brother\'s system** at the time of his death, so the Narcan would not have helped anyway. Google says that Narcan does not harm you if there are no drugs in your system, so I\'m assuming that it didn\'t cause his death.\n\nThe official cause of death was ruled as **""prescription drug overdose""** \\- the coroner who made the report was flabbergasted that he was on such a cocktail of medications. When we asked the rehab program about his medications, they said his dosages were standard procedure for all recovering drug addicts (I\'m wondering if they had him on methadone?).\n\nI do not know what medications he was on. My mom requested medical records from the rehab center **4 times before they finally complied and sent them over** (and they only complied after she contacted the owner in frustration). She just received physical copies of his records, but I can\'t get them from her until I visit home next month. I\'m also uncertain about whether their delay is a red flag or not - maybe they\'re just slammed with work, but it doesn\'t help assuage any questions about whether foul play was involved and then covered up.\n\n*Other details about my brother\'s health:*\n\n\\- He was addicted to ""whatever could get him high"" so he struggled with both meth and heroin/opioids at various points. His most recent relapse (\\~3 months before his death) involved meth.\n\n\\- He had **bulimia that went untreated for years.** He had been to the emergency room multiple times over the past few years with dangerously low potassium - he was very close to going into cardiac arrest a couple years ago and stayed in the hospital for a week on an IV. I think the eating disorder did long term damage to his body, but at the time of his death he had been learning how to cook and eat better as he was working on his recovery. He had been in treatment for months at that point. He cooked chili for all his friends right before he died.\n\n\\- As I said before, he was sober when he died, which sparks many of my questions...\n\nWhat caused him to ""stiffen up"" in the first place? Could internal bleeding caused from being hit kickstart such a reaction, or maybe a severe panic attack? The coroner firmly said that he did not die of a heart attack and she maintains it was prescription drug overdose, so I wonder why he died *then* if he had been on those meds for a few months? Could there have been an adverse reaction between all of his medications and the two doses of Narcan?\n\nI know this is a behemoth of a post, so I apologize, and please know that I greatly appreciate any insight that anyone has to offer. I\'m not sure whether it\'s worth it to dig into his medical records/the official reports of his death, so I\'m partially asking whether you all think that his death is explainable based on these facts, or whether there\'s more to find out here?\n\nI also would like to say, for posterity, that I do not blame either the person who hit my brother or the staff member at the sober living program for my brother\'s death. I understand that neither are at fault, and I only hope that they can move on from this event that was traumatizing to all involved. I just want closure, I guess? I wonder a lot about how he died. My biggest fear is that he died of a broken heart - from crying so hard - because he felt alone/hurt (I had recently gone no contact with him). I don\'t even know if that\'s possible in this situation.\n\nAny insight is greatly appreciated.'"

The rash creates a rough texture on my skin that looks like blisters but isn't fluid filled or weeping. It will generally last a few days, worst case was almost a week. It doesn't appear to be contagious because it doesn't spread on my body or to anyone I come into contact with. \n\nI originally thought it was a reaction to a higher dose of Lamictal, but the Dr felt a drug reaction isolated only to my hands and feet was odd, and it's continued to happen even after stopping Lamictal all together.\n\n I can't find a trigger that's common among when it happens, and it happens every few months. My white blood cell count has been consistently high for several months, going from 12 to 15 and now back to 14.7 with no known cause. This happened to me several years ago (the high count) and the cause was never found then either, but a rash has never been present before with the wbc flare ups.\n\nI've been to GI, and have also been tested for several autoimmune disorders including celiac and they have all come back negative. \n\nRemedies tried: hydrocortisone cream, benadryl, itching relief sprays, allegra, different Temps of water..nothing works or makes it worse.

Is it ok to take this dosage of Prednisone and Diclofenac like the doctor originally told me (next paragraph) as long as I take food with them? I do plan on calling my doctor first thing Monday morning since they closed early yesterday afternoon when I had concerns.\n\nI went to the doctor yesterday, late morning, for back/neck pain with horrible headaches. She said my muscles from mid-back up to the top of my neck were extremely tense. She double checked my current meds then put me on a steroid, NSAID (after double checking about my allergic reaction, we will try this and Im to let her know if anything happens), and muscle relaxer but didnt say names of prescriptions. She said I need to take the steroid and NSAID with breakfast first thing in the morning, then take another steroid around 2pm since it could keep me up at night if taken too late, then take another NSAID at dinner time, then a muscle relaxer at bedtime.\n\nMy background from working in a vet clinic had me concerned about taking steroids and NSAIDS together because Ive always been told they shouldnt be taken together. I ignored that feeling and trusted the doctor because shes the doctor. I get to work later but couldnt shake that gut feeling so I tried to call the doctor to confirm what needed taken at but they were already closed until Monday. I also wanted to know if I could take something OTC until I could pick up my meds after work and what would be best to take without reaction to new meds. Before I called the pharmacy, I opened my app to see my prescriptions so I knew what to ask specifically. I called the pharmacy and they said I could take Tylenol. I ended up not having Tylenol on me so I went without until I could get my meds.\n\nI got to the pharmacy and the pharmacist didnt question anything except my allergic reaction before filling the NSAID. Finally ready to checkout but the pharmacist was working with someone else and it was really busy so I had an intern go over my meds with me. First I noticed they were all labeled BID or BIDAN, not as detailed as what my dr told me. I asked about that the steroids and NSAIDS being taken together and the intern said it should be fine since its just a short term thing. I got my meds and left and figured itll be ok, shes the intern Im not.\n\nLast night at bedtime I only took the Diclofenac and Trizanidine. This morning I called the pharmacy and spoke with the pharmacist about my concerns and she suggested only taking the Prenisone until gone the switch to the Diclofenac. I still plan on contacting my doctor first thing Monday morning to double check everything.\n\nAm I being too paranoid or is ok to take this dosage of Prednisone and Diclofenac like the doctor originally told me as long as I take food with them?'"

He was amazing, the best part was he actually listened to me. It honestly felt like a partnership. I saw him for close to 10 years, and because it was a cancer treatment facility, when I got flare ups, I went in and was prescribed/administered IV pain meds and fluids.\nAs Dr. B was older, he finally decided to retire in order to spend more time with his family.\nWhen he did retire he referred me to a new doctor who joined the practice. Dr. S.\n\nRight off the bat, on our first meeting she was immediately combative, she went on a diatribe about my pain meds and how she\'s strict about them. She immediately made me sign a pain management contract and stated if I ever broke the contract I was out.\n\nThe first time I had my crisis, and came to the infusion center, she cut my prescription from 6mg to 4. Not a big deal, but now most times I have to go in 2-3 days to get my pain under control rather than the 1 day before.\n\nThen we had a discussion about a drug Hydra. I mentioned that Dr. B had me on it, it caused me to get sick more frequently and eventually caused me to almost die in the ICU. I was going into sepsis from toxicity from that particular medication.\n\nShe didn\'t care, wanted me on it. I tried to argue my case but she never listened. So, I decided I just won\'t pick up the prescription from the pharmacy.\nEventually she found out I wasn\'t taken the meds (blood tests), I reluctantly agreed to start taking them.\n\nWell my previous experience is repeating itself, I\'m having more frequent crisis, almost every other week.\nThe last time I went into the infusion center for pain management, the drugs were cut again, this time from 4mg to 2.\nI talked 4mg Dilaudid orally, which as I understand it, the bioavailability comes down to 2. So wondering why she\'did prescribe 2mg when I\'ve done 2mg every 3 hours at home didn\'t help.\nAnyway, talked to the administering Nurse and was told ""well you\'ll get a second dose later so it\'s the same thing"". This came from Dr. S.\n\nWith my crisis getting more frequent and having this, I pretty much stopped going to the infusion center. It\'s all the inconvenience of getting there, getting a ride to come back, without actually relieving my pain, seems like I\'m just as well taking the same dose at home.\n\nThis brings us to today, she had me stop the hydrea to try a new medication, an infusion of crizanlizumab.\n\nThis triggered a bad flare up, my pain was at a 9 in my joints and back, my face was flush. My bp which is normally 110/60 jumped to 155/70.\nThe nurses gave me benedryl, and steroids to mitigate the reaction.\n\nThe doctor refused to prescribe pain meds. The nurses asked her a number of times, finally she said I could have Toradal.\nAnyway, I wasn\'t looking/feeling better and both nurses decide to contact the doctor again requesting pain meds.\n\nWhen the nurse came back, she whispered to the other nurse that she asked the doctor whose response was ""I don\'t believe him"".\nIt\'s one thing to go through crap like that from ER doctors who don\'t know my history, but from the doctor that\'s been treating me for over 5 years?\n\nI know this is an unusual situation/question for this sub, but at this point I\'m at a loss for what to do.\nSo, doctors in the sub, what do you recommend?'"

I stopped taking the sulfa, went on a tapering round of prednisone (done now). I've been back to work a couple weeks now but I still don't feel right. Is it normal to still have symptoms after this long?""","b""When the allergic reaction first hit, my pcp was closed so I went to Urgent Care. They told me to stop taking the Sulfa drug, gave something for the nausea and benadryl for the rest but the Dr was clearly concerned. He asked me to come back in the following day (free of charge) because he was concerned. The next day the swelling was worse, though the fever had gone down. He wanted to run some tests but my insurance wouldn't allow it because my pcp was open (HMO) so I had to switch doctors. My pcp was (understandably) rushed, didn't order any tests other than checking my temp and blood pressure, put me on tapering doses of prednisone and sent me on my way, with the addendum of telling me to go straight to ER if I experienced any other symptoms.\n\nThe high fever, rash and swelling have gone away, along with the vomiting, confusion, chills and the worst of the fatigue so at first I thought I was in the clear. Now however, I'm getting bad acid reflux every evening and sometimes during the day. I've never had this before. My arms peeled like I'd had a bad sunburn (but didn't) and all my skin is suddenly dry to the point it's painful. Dry skin has never been an issue before now. My urine is medium to dark, no matter how much water I'm drinking and my stools still aren't normal. \n\nIs this all coincidental, or should I be concerned? None of it seems serious enough to warrant a visit to ER or an already overloaded doctor's office, especially given everything going on at the moment."""
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/139j0ck/reaction_to_medication_during_procedure_scared_to/,b'Reaction to medication during procedure- scared to go back to finish it',"b'Female 32 years old 54 approx 160 lbs\nMedication- methadone (tapering-currently down to 15 mg from 120 mg) adderall 30 xr & 30 ir but I dont always take the tablet in the afternoon and I would like to completely stop taking them altogether, 20 mg fluoxetine, 500 mg amoxicillin\n\nHeart disease and high blood pressure is in a lot of family members (parents & grandparents)- nobody smokes, nobody is obese, and everyone eats healthy \n\n\nYesterday I went to have my wisdom teeth removed and I opted for local numbing rather than being put to sleep.. Ive been clean for 5 years and I try to be as smart as possible when dealing with medical procedures that require medications. I had a wisdom tooth removed before while on all this same medication, and a few other dental procedures as well that required local numbing agents. There were no issues with those procedures. \n\nThe dentist administered a few shots of lidocaine and I still wasnt completely numb so he kept giving me more shots until after a few more ( I could have technically had 6 more) I started to feel extremely weird, my body got very hot and tingly, and my heart rate was up to 100 bpm and my blood pressure was high (he didnt say how high just that it was high). He told me this is normal because the shot has ephedrine in it. I had no clue what ephedrine was but he told me that it speeds up the heart rate and that I would be okay and I would feel better in a few mins. I was really scared at this point. I couldnt imagine that this happens all the time, I actually felt like I was dying and I asked him if I was dying which Im really embarrassed about now! I kept thinking of all the heart disease in my family (mom had 3 major heart attacks before 50 and has stents, grandma died of heart failure during hip surgery), and honestly I was probably making myself feel even worse by being so paranoid but I couldnt calm myself down and I just wanted to make it home to my kids. I asked him if the adderall could have caused this and he said even though its a stimulant, it should not have had any interaction with the lidocaine/ephedrine. After a while I started to feel better, he administered more numbing shots without ephedrine and again, my heart rate went up, I got blurry vision, my body was tingly and numb, my face turned red, and once they put the oxygen on my face I started to feel better within a minute or two. I have only had anxiety or panic attacks a few times years ago and I have dental stuff done all the time with local numbing shots plus Ive been on all these medications for years. I am extremely confused as to what could have caused this and I ended up leaving with a prescription for amoxicillin because the infection is so bad that it was blocking the ability to get properly numb. I have to go back next Friday to try this procedure again but honestly, I am really afraid to go back but I need these teeth removed as the pain is unbearable and I have 3 year old twins and a 2 year old who require a lot of my care. He then handed me a script for Percocet before leaving which Im sure is common for most people but I asked him for 800 mg ibu instead for obvious reasons. I was kind of surprised that he would even give me a prescription for opioids with my history of drug abuse especially just for wisdom teeth/molar pain. \n\nDid one of my medications interfere with those numbing shots/ephedrine? Or could this have been a panic attack? Ive had a few panic attacks before years ago and this was different. Ive had a headache and blurry vision since this happened yesterday\n\nI should note that I had a similar reaction once when I was in labor with my twins. At the hospital, the nurse gave me Stadol in my iv and immediately I had the same reaction, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, warm tingly numb feeling all over my body, blurred vision. When my MFM doctor came in the next morning, I was so scared so I told him what happened he said that medication should not have been given to me since Im on methadone and hes not sure why the doctor would have approved that. I got an epidural and all was well the rest of the labor and delivery. \n\nIm am very up front about medications Im taking with all doctors, dentists, or anyone who is caring for me.\n\nAnother thing that made me uneasy but it may be nothing at all- when I checked in the receptionist told me that their entire system is down: internet, phones, payment machine, everything so they were not doing surgery with anesthesia today but that wouldnt affect me since I was only doing local. Once I get back into the room, I hear okay Mr.____, wake up your surgery is over. Open your eyes...I dont typically pay attention to things that dont involve myself but I just thought that was kind of odd. I typically trust all medical professionals and am easy going/laid back so for that to catch my attention, I felt like was worth something. My dentist referred me here and United Concordia has already paid for this procedure with this oral surgeon and I already paid my portion so I dont even think going anywhere else is possible. Plus, I dont think this is his fault. I dont know what happened but I do know I am extremely nervous to go back'"
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13ejtn1/rash_on_lips/,b'Rash on lips',"b'32F, I take daily: Doxepin (to help *stay* asleep), Fluoxetine (for mild depression), Pramipexole (for restless leg syndrome), Daysee birth control pill, Unisom (to help *get* to sleep), Naltrexone (for substance abuse, but have been totally clean & sober for 10+ years now). I have been on all of these medications together for several years now, without any issues. I also use a daily probiotic for digestion, and a daily women\'s probiotic for feminine health. I often take Zyrtec D, Delsym cough syrup, and Mucinex for environmental allergies (dust). I also take a women\'s daily gummy vitamin. None of these things are new, and I have been taking them for years previously without any issues.\n\nWhen I was going through puberty (appx age 11-13), I developed a bad red/pink rash around my lips and mouth. It looked like very severe acne, but was only around my mouth (the rest of my face was perfectly clear). My lips were involved too, with them being incredibly dry, chapped, cracked, and peeling, while at the same time oozing yellowish clear pus from tiny pustules (I think pustules is the right word, I can\'t remember exactly)...little tiny bumps filled with fluid. Neither the bumps nor the discharge was white in color, the bumps being the same color as the skin around it (pinkish-red to translucent). The rash seemed to emanate from my lips and spread around my mouth (on my face) from there, particularly in the corners of the mouth, and below it, in my upper chin area. Applying plain chapstick or Vaseline seemed to help with the pain of the extreme dryness, but it\'s as if my lips and rash just soaked it all right up - within a few minutes, it was as if I had never even put any on, and was just as dry (if not more) than before. Both the rash and my lips were bumpy, oozing pus, while also dry and peeling. I remember it being very uncomfortable.\n\nBack then, the doctors initially thought that it was HSV, but then determined that was not actually the case. Dermatologists performed a patch test for allergies on my back (that\'s how I know about the dust), but what created the same reaction was a specific type of metal (I don\'t remember the name of it, but I remember them determining that it wasn\'t in soda cans, or any typical metal object that might be touching my lips). At the time, I had braces and headgear, and the dermatologists determined that it must be in those, and that I was reacting to that (even though they weren\'t new).\n\nBut when we discussed this with my orthodontist, he did some research, and determined (by speaking with the manufacturers) that that specific type of metal was not in any of the materials in my braces or in my headgear. And so, the dermatologists just kind of shrugged their shoulders and sent me on my way. The rash and lips eventually cleared up on its own after a couple of years.\n\nYears later, at age 21, I went to inpatient treatment for opioid abuse. After detoxing, the same rash suddenly began to appear again (although it did not get as severe this time). One of the NP\'s saw it and stated something like ""Oh yeah, that\'s just a skin sensitivity in reaction to whatever products you\'re using on your lips. Only use plain original unscented chapstick or Vaseline on your lips, and that should clear it right up. I see this all the time.""\n\nSo I did, and she was right, that did take care of it. I wasn\'t using anything crazy on my face or lips at the time, but scented/flavored chapstick was a favorite of mine. During the puberty episode, I had been using Burt\'s Bees Lip Balm or Blistex. I had also never used drugs or drank alcohol prior to or during the puberty flair up.\n\nOver the years since then, it would occasionally start to come back mildly, but then I\'d just load it up with Vaseline, which would take care of it before it got any worse. It made sense to me that internal times of stress within my body triggered it (going through puberty, detoxing off of addicting substances, ect). \n\nNow, at age 32, it has come back with a vengeance. It started off with just chapped lips and dry corners of my mouth, that would eventually get a little crusty if I didn\'t wipe it away and reapply the plain chapstick. I thought that was just due to the seasons changing. But then the corners of my mouth started to crack and become painful, and the rash began to appear, emanating from the corners of my lips - out and downward. \n\nSo I started to load on the Vaseline (which would always heal it when it got to this point before, except during the first puberty outbreak). But this time, it has only continued to get worse. It is presenting slightly different this time though, in that the rash has been worse on my lips and not spread out on my face nearly as much. There is also a very bloody-looking ring around the inside of my lips, where my outer lips meet my inner lips (which I don\'t remember happening before), although it is not actually bleeding. But otherwise, the symptoms are the same... My lips are swollen and burning, incredibly dry, chapped, cracked, and peeling, with tiny oozing pustules that just immediately soak up any chapstick I might apply. The same yellowish-clear pus oozes out of them. But some of the bumps are red at this point. My lips feel very tight, swollen, bumpy, wet, and crusty, all at the same time. But I have zero trouble breathing.\n\nI feel certain that this is more than simply severe chapped lips, due to the rash, bumps, pus, and history with similar outbreaks. But I cannot for the life of me think of anything that I\'ve been doing differently lately that might\'ve caused this. I don\'t use topical steroid creams. I don\'t even really use any products on my face. The only makeup I wear is mascara, which is also not a new brand or formula or anything. I don\'t use soap on my face, just whatever might run across it in the shower from my hair...but again, nothing new there. \n\nAt this point, it\'s getting worse by the day, and has gotten significantly worse over the course of the day today. I\'m planning to go to the doctor soon. Right now, I\'m looking for some expertise thoughts on what this possibly could be? Or what it might be caused by? Because to me, I seem to have symptoms that could fit many possible different things, but none are exactly spot-on and all-inclusive of my symptoms either. And also, I\'m not a doctor or medical professional. Hence, why I\'m here asking you. I will attach pictures in the comments. Thank you'"

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13yt9tj/can_you_possibly_solve_this_or_provide_insight/,b'can you possibly solve this or provide insight? (Long) (Very interesting case)',"b""First and last post here! \n\nThis may be a long read, but I truly, truly appreciate it if everyone would stick around and add their insight to this. \n\nBackground: 21 male, 5'10, Caucasian (Scottish, Slovakian, French) \nLocation: Canada \n\nI have 2 sisters, 2 nephews, and 1 niece, which is important to factor in, and I'll explain why briefly.\n\nWhen I was just little used to light up bright red only on my face and neck typically only in stressful or public situations (terrible social anxiety), it wasn't itchy, just hot and red and I would sweat a lot.  According to my mom (54), she used to get the same thing in front of people but eventually grew out of it. \n\nNow regarding my niece and nephews, they also get red in the face and have trouble regulating body temperature but not due to any type of anxiety, as it stands we could call it idiopathic and it resembles Lupus or maybe rosacea however - my oldest nephew also has some skin problems and my youngest often gets fevers and hives from many things but treats it with things like advil. \n\nThe above is important in MY case I believe because when I was around 13 I was put on 20mg of cipralex (2014), in October 2019 (17) I went into anaphylaxis for the first time due to amoxicillin which I took due to sinus congestion (mom also has chronically) and I had it lying around from a previous infection, the anaphylaxis scared me into not taking any medication so I abruptly cut down my cipralex and for some reason believed I wouldn't need them anymore. \n\nAfter doing this, I one day woke up with the most severe depersonalisation and derealisation anyone could ever have alongside a gross number of other discontinuation symptoms which lasted over 3 months and eventually subsided after reinstating 10-15mg of the same medication, the most IMPORTANT part of this is I had developed Tinnitus and anisacoria after this AND I couldn't take the meds anymore because I developed symptoms of seratonin toxicity so I had to get off all together and just deal with it. \n\nFast forward to 2021-2022 and now things are serious, my body is behaving terribly since I've changed things up and it's worth mentioning that the rash / redness I used to only get on my face and neck had began to progress down to my chest and eventually to my legs but it's not itchy and only happens in the sun, in stressful situations/ conditions. That's the least of it, I began getting constipated by almost ALL foods and chicken and rice were my only tolerable foods (until they weren't), I wasn't getting rashes but it's like I developed this hypersensitivity in the signals from my stomach, it began feeling tight and caused me to be severely constipated for over 33 days (not exaggerated), my blood sugar was 1.3, you could say I was intolerant to almost everything but not allergic. \n\nThis is where things got weird, at this point I've seen almost all of the BEST specialists in Canada and been to the best hospitals which costed me a lot of money that I just happened to coincidentally have (now I don't) and a lot of time, as I mentioned I had been extremely constipated UNTIL I received saline solution VIA IV injection overnight, I got home a day later and had the most excruciatingly painful poop ever and it was disgusting - I know it was from the saline IV because this happened more than once and that was the only thing I was issued other than the mix of vitamins (Please explain this if possible!) \n\nNow, I got the blockage out and still continued to have serious issues and kept myself near the hospitals (in Toronto), I had more needle holse in my arm than any addict ever (painful) due to the amount of blood work done but now I was down to 98 lbs from 184 (I was kind of overweight prior to all of this) and I had given up so I decided (f it, I'll have what I want) and started to intake calories again by what I thought was healthier (Boba, cauliflower bites etc) than what I used to have thankfully toronto had these options. \n\nAnyway, this is what leads us to the most current circumstances/ situation - everything I ate / eat lots of carbs, sugar or fibre  my body temperature increases and I get really gassy, my veins dilate massively, I become lethargic, low blood pressure and I have a red face BUT when I take things like vitamin C, D, Zinc, Dandelion, Burdock Root, Reishi (yes I taught myself natural medicine because I had to), the symptoms reverse BUT I get this 'tight' feeling in my stomach which is why I describe the whole hypersensitivity thing because I can feel almost everything. I get the tightness, the gas gets trapped, and my body temp decreases. \n\nNow I'll give a brief on the important tests I've done due to suspicions I and few doctors had about specific diseases: \nHATS(tryptase and genes), MASTOCYTOSIS(c-kit), POLYCYTHEMIA VERA (jak 2), LEUKEMIA (bcr-abl), MYELOPROLIFERATIVE NEOPLASMS(calr), PORPHYRIA, ANEMIA (MANY TYPES), C3, C4, CRP, INR, ANTI DNA, LEUKOCYTES, PROTEIN (urine), IMMUNOGLOBULINS, THYROID ANTIBODIES AND FUNCTION, DOUBLE STRAND ANTIBODIES, RHUMATOID FACTOR (10 >14), VITAMIN D,MRI'S, CT'S(brain amd stomach), ECHO'S, ULTRASOUNDS (of everything), ALLERGY SKIN TESTING, SERATONIN(urine) and maybe more that I didn't see. \n\nThe results that were 'positive' and stood out + dates discovered: \n\nThyroglobulin antibodies >184 (2023)\nThyroperoxidase antibodies >135 (2023)\nC3 >89 (2021)\nBilirubin >30 (2021)\nAlbumin >53 (2021)\nUrate >192 (2021) \nBetween 2021-2022, at my worst, I had consistently low wbc and neutrophils, whether from malnutrition or something else. I'm unsure\nSinus arythmia (2021)\nSlight pericardial effusion (2022)\nHead CT w/o contrast >scattered bilateral white matter lesions on brain?

I'm dying to know what's going on and I haven't given up, I've had one person be there with me through the entirety of this and they know good and well it's not like me, all of that just made things worse but I understand.\n\nI used to be into modifying cars (i had 4 already), boxing, weight lifting, bmxing, jogging, etc. \n\nYet people still thought I simply went mad.\n\nThe ONLY relief I've had through this is when I did strict carnivore diet, had the sedation for my colonoscopy AND when I ate a Scotch bonnet pepper - it relived everything for about 30 seconds (oddly) and I kid you not, I'm not sure the mechanism behind these things but they're which makes me think it's neurological? Nothing has remissed me to my old self completely.\n\nI've also taken several different medications, including (mostly under the suspicions of mast cell disease)\nPrednisone \nDiphenhydramine\nFamitodine\nCeterizine \nCompounded cromolyn Sodium\nCompounded hydroxyzine\nAspirin \nAlka seltzer \nA few more I can't remember \nNone of which provided relief and had rather strange side effects such as clicking in my jaw and tight stomach.\n+Meditation, Chiropractors, Accupresure etc.\n\nMain symptoms: \nGassy 24/7 no matter what!\nOn empty stomach (after colonoscopy prep, for example).

Increased TNF? Metabolic acidosis?)\n\nThank you very much for reading this far and taking the time to think over this if you have! I really appreciate it!.\n\nThe only 'good' that has come from this from my perspective is that I learned an abundance about body functions, natural health, psychology, and I was capable of making a few books out of it.

Never smoked but one parent was a chain smoker, drink once or twice a year, and even then only a unit or two. No drug use. All heart/breathing issues predate both testosterone and Concerta. \n\nI had some arrhythmia, flagged with a potential branch bundle block, on a recent ECG taken prior to starting Concerta. I also have breathing difficulties that have been presumed asthma, but with negative spirometry and no wheezing, but I\'ve long suspected maybe heart related.\n\nRegardless, my Salbutamol inhaler makes breathing easier when I\'m struggling and helps the headaches I get at the same time. Alleviating the heavy chest feeling I have. Counter to the common side effects, it lowers my heart rate, and seems to stabilise it, either from fast and what feels irregular/fluttery or on other occasions extremely heavy, but also irregular. \n\nI\'ve recently been titrated to Concerta 54mg and have been on this dose for less than two weeks. In this time my blood pressure has lowered from being on the cusp high blood pressure to around 105/73, and on a couple of occasions 96/66. My resting pulse at night is around 50-55bpm, so higher than the 45-46bpm common before, though it seems the same during the day (71ish)and seems to fluctuate less, no longer suddenly jumping high for no reason.  I\'ve also suddenly needed my inhaler less. \n\nI know this is a strange thought, but both the Salbutamol and Concerta are supposed to elevate heart rate and blood pressure, but are seemingly doing the opposite. Is it possible that the medications are causing a reaction in my heart that is correcting the arrhythmia, making it easier for my body to function?'"

I have been smoking for about 3 years now, pretty much every day, but only at night and at pretty small amounts (mostly just a bowl thru a dry herb vape, sometimes a hit or two off a pen).\n\n3 days ago, I woke up to an awful pain in my guts, something that felt like bad gas. Thinking I just had to go to the bathroom, I walked downstairs, but by the time I reached the toilet I was gagging. Nothing really came up, I was mostly just dry heaving. I felt immediately better afterwards, and decided to go about my day. I got in the shower, and after about 15-20 mins after my first time puking I started feeling crummy again, eventually dry heaving again right after my shower. Felt better, and was able to eat a banana and drink some water before throwing up one last time a couple hours later, this time with a few small chunks. Felt terrible for the rest of the day, and went #2 a couple times during the day as well (very soft, also worth noting it smelled so so bad). During the day I had some minor muscle aches, and ran about 100F when I took my temp. Went to bed real early, and woke up part way through the night and felt immensely better.\n\nNext day I felt better, had a bit more of an appetite but still felt a little bit off (fever gone luckily).

Didnt smoke last night and now today Im feeling a bit better, but still feeling not very hungry and my guts are still a little bubbly. \n\nObviously hoping its not CHS, but after doing research my symptoms seem to align very closely with other peoples experiences. My only doubts are: this appeared suddenly and unexpectedly (Ive had no prior reactions like this to cannabis), hot showers didnt help my nausea, and I felt better after throwing up.

I can\'t overexaggerate it and I can\'t imagine living like this forever. I\'m not organically depressed, but this life sucks.\n\nIbuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and hydrocodone have no effect. High concentration CBD oil, lidocaine, and herbal lotions have no effect. When I say no effect, I mean it. Nothing happens.\n\nLast year I was put on duloxetine. Quite frankly, the first and only dose made me trip balls. I hallucinated intensely for a few hours and stayed high with minor hallucinations for a few days afterwards. Next was amitriptyline. Also made me hallucinate (MUCH less) and gave me the worst head/eye-ache of my life. That was the first and last dose as well.\n\nI got put on pregabalin 25 mgs 2x daily and I started to see a small difference. It wasn\'t enough, but no side effects so we upped it to 50 mgs 2x daily.

My symptoms are debilitating and as I get older, life is demanding more of me. I can\'t keep up. \n\nI told my doctor all this and he seemed stumped. Today he gave me a muscle relaxer for ""better sleep."" I sleep fine. I need pain relief. I asked if there are any other options and he basically said no (I don\'t want to try gabapentin for family history reasons, plus it\'s so similar to pregabalin anyway. He doesn\'t want me on it either).\n\nI asked him about medical cannabis. It\'s legal here, even at my age. He insultingly said ""smoke as much weed as you want,"" and ""do whatever you want."" I\'m not trying to get stoned. He doesn\'t think it\'s ""all that"" and they don\'t reccomend cards at his practice anyway. I don\'t think it\'s all that either, but the drugs I\'ve been told really are ""all that"" either did fuck all or made me trip.\n\nI guess I\'m asking: what are my actual options at this point? This isn\'t pain I can stand anymore, and I\'m doing everything else damn near perfect. I should feel healthy.\n\nIs it worth it to spend hundreds of dollars to even START the process of getting a card? Especially with my previous reactions to non-psychoactive stuff?

With in 2 bites.\n\nWe call the childrens hospital, they tell us the dose of Benadryl to give her and it slowly clears up over the next few hours. Went to our regular doctor they said that in a few weeks try something where corn wasnt the main ingredient. So we did, same reaction. \n\nBack to the doctor, they send us to an allergist. They did a skin test and she has a reaction, they ordered a blood test, and it comes back negative. Doctor says that corn is a disputed allergy some dont believe it is a thing, and that she most likely dosent have it because of that. But we agree to set up a challenge, that is in 3 weeks. \n\nTonight we have her broccoli. Good and gather straight broccoli. Had the same reaction.

Bloodwork was all fine except for low B12 and very very low Vitamin D. They did chest xrays which were clear and a full abdominal ultrasound which showed nothing. She did notice I have always had a bit higher than normal blood pressure so she started me on 5mg Amlodipine. My primary doc then referred me to a cardiologist for a stress test.  \nIn Jan I did a treadmill test but could not keep my heart rate up as long as they needed to due to an old ankle injury and the incline on the treadmill. They just said it was \'not enough information to diagnose\'. Then I had a nuclear stress test and that showed a small percentage of my heart \'does not work properly\' (less than 5%).  \nCardio doc referred me for a CT scan but it\'s not until Sept.  \nCardiologist started me on the following meds (in addition to the amlodipine)  \nAsprin 81 mg daily  \nAtorvastatin 40 mg daily  \nBisprolol 5 mg daily  \nRamipril 5 mg daily  \nI started Atorvastatin and Ramipril on the same day and had an allergic reaction to one of the meds then had to wait for my system to calm down to try both again, one at a time. (I have severe food allergies and chronic idiopathic urticaria, so it set me off for a couple weeks). Ramipril was fine but Atorvastatin caused a reaction so we stopped that.  \nBy March I was on  \nAsprin 81 mg daily  \nBisprolol 5 mg daily  \nRamipril 5 mg daily  \nHad an anaphylactic episode on April 8 to (probably) food and ended up in the hospital on a Saturday night. They monitored my heart rate and bp there and they said nothing about my heart rate or my blood pressure (it seemed to be what they expect for the medical issue I was experiencing). The monday after the episode I was unable to regulate my heart rate or my blood pressure (both were high) so I went back to emerg. The doc said sometimes that happens, plus with my anxiety he was not surprised. Had the heart wires (ecg?) and blood pressure cuff on the whole time, said BP was high but not out of range for what he would expect. He gave me a few ativan and told me to just give myself a few days to even out again.  \nI relayed the episode to my cardiologist and the next week she changed my meds to:  \nAmlodipine 5 mg (no change from before)  \nCandesartan 4 mg (new med)  \nAnd instructed me to stop taking the bisprolol, the ramipril and the aspirin.  \nOne week after the med change I noticed my heart rate had gone from an approx 74-77 rhr to 85-89, and I wasn\'t sure why. Cardiologist said the bisprolol was the one that reduced my HR so it\'s fine to see an increase, and I need not be worried unless it\'s hitting 100 or higher with regularity.  \nHad a follow up with my regular doc for a shingles vax two weeks ago, mentioned that my anxiety was a little worse than the past month or so, she advised it\'s likely because the bisprolol was a \'beta blocker\' and was helping to keep me in a calmer state. I am super hesitant to try yet another new pill I could be allergic to (for anxiety meds) so she put me back on bisprolol, but at half the dose. So 2.5 mg.  \nI have a blood pressure machine at home and am trying to do more regular readings. I have had a notification for an irregular heartbeat twice now, once on Saturday and once today. So now I am completely spiralling again and sort of need to know what is normal and \'acceptable\' or when I need to be concerned.  \nFull disclosure, my anxiety is VERY high when I don\'t have all the information. I have been trying to learn as much as I can so that I don\'t keep ramping myself up with worry. I know that the irregular heartbeat could be just because I moved or because it\'s just a consumer machine from costco. But then, I\'ll get the tiniest little flutter or weird feeling and will be crazy obsessed with watching my heart rate on my fitbit (or even wearing my pulse oximeter for hours). I know things fluctuate, etc., but I am waaaay high up on this here ledge of anxiety, which does not help my damn heart.  \nThank you for your time.'"

At first I assumed it was a mosquito bite, but the spot always disappears within an hour or two and doesn\'t leave any mark, unlike a mosquito bite.

Other parts of my body have gained spasms such as my eye muscles and my back. What weve figured out so far is I experienced too much stress and my body could not deal well with it and has reactions to things now.

Reactin helps with getting by day to day. \n\nI also have a genetic disorder that only ten people have ever been recorded with, cant say the name on here due to privacy reasons but the only effects of it known so far are tube formations during pregnancy (me as a fetus not me pregnant) such as bowel malrotations, ureter placement, etc.. I do not think it has anything to do with what I am about to ask. \n\nOkay, now on to the actual post. CONTEXT THAT MAY HELP: I wear glasses. \nA few months ago I noticed a bump behind my RIGHT ear. I then started to notice dry and peeling skin, so I brought it up to my doctor. She said it looked normal and that it would go away by itself, and that it was most likely a swollen lymph node. So I put some polysporin on it and waited. I even tried putting a bandage behind my ear so my glasses wouldnt rub against it. \nA few weeks later, I started to get the dry skin thing behind my LEFT ear. No swollen lymph node, just the dry and peeling skin. At first I just thought it was because of my glasses. However its been months and my left ear looks like this (I will attach a photo in the description). My right ear still has the swollen lymph node, but it seems to have healed a bit. Ill attach a photo of that one as well. \n\nWhat do you think? Is it because of my glasses? From mask wearing (although I barely go out)? Is it just dry skin? Why is it symmetrical? What do I do about this? And why wont my swollen lymph node stop swelling?'"

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13b6yyn/what_could_this_be_dermatology_question/,b'What could this be? Dermatology question',"b'I (24F) have had many confirmed MRSA infections over the past 2.5 years. Med history: 150ish pounds, 5 4. Confirmed endometriosis, two full-term pregnancies not without complications, gallbladder removed, skin graft in my mouth. Hypersomnia (potentially narcolepsy, but treated as hypersomnia for now) treated by armodafinil and Adderall for ADHD. \n\nInfection history: infections started on my right forearm. They gradually moved up my arm, across my chest to my left breast, and proceeded to pop up elsewhere including my legs, back/hip, and face. One at a time generally. Presents as a small pimple-like spot and quickly expands to a larger, painful, inflamed infection. Ive had the emergency room lance many and start me on oral antibiotics normally. Urgent care docs have done the same a couple times. The one time it made its way into my breast, it presented as mastitis from breastfeeding (was a rough go, lots of bleeding nipple instances and thrush passed between babe and me). Oral antibiotics did nothing. Ended up in the ER due to severity who immediately started me on 3 intravenous IVs (including vancomycin which I ended up having an allergic reaction to). Once the pain had gone down some, they admitted me and the abscess was aspirated the following day. 4-day stay overall. This was April 2021. All instances of infections being lanced have also been cultured and come back as MRSA.\n\nOk so the current problem: Sunday last week (4/30) I noticed a pimple-like spot above my right eyebrow. I probably popped it open as I do with most pimples. Monday morning, it was swollen, hard, painful, red, large - classic MRSA infection for me. Swelling up my eyebrow and below. I tried everything throughout the week to help it be overcome without having to drain or lance it. Neosporin, other OTC antibiotic cream, baking soda+coconut oil, warm washcloth soaks, nothing was helping. It was growing a little, extremely painful to the point of not using my eyebrow, the head of it was turning black. With soaks, that head would turn greenish and goopy. I was able to get that greenish goop top off once but it didnt make a difference. I was unable to get any puss out, despite the swelling and raised head. \n\nYesterday I was feeling a bit sick - really tired, nauseous, whole body just off. Today I felt not great, temp of 99.6, but spent time working outside in the sun for a few hours anyway. Showered when I came back in, normal face wash then coconut oil+baking soda paste left on for a while. When I began washing the paste off my face, the head had turned from black (before shower) to green goop again. I pressed lightly on the outer edge to see if it was puss that would come out. I got a small amount of pussy-blood then just blood - but it all came from around the head instead of inside the head.\n\nUsing toilet paper, I dabbed the head to see if it was going to absorb into the tissue or stay where it was, get a feel for the texture. It would stick a little to the tissue but wouldnt come off. It was also tender when it was pulled even just the little bit by the tissue. I overcame that fear of the tenderness and used my finger to gently roll the puss out to see what would happen. It came out as a solid ball. It left behind a bleeding crater with a little bit of green goop on one edge. I pressed the perimeter again to see if there was underlying puss and all i got was a bit of blood. Could not get the remainder of the green goop out between pain and a weak stomach. \n\nWhat the heck caused this though?! Its definitely a first for me - having an open, raw crater in my face and a ball of green goop come out. Photos attached of before my shower today, then after. \n\nI see a dermatologist for the first time tomorrow (Monday) to address this MRSA crap and see if theres a way to prevent these infections. The nose swab I had done a year or two ago came back clear. \n\nWhat do you think the derm will do about this tomorrow? \n\nThanks!!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/muKXEtO'"

When a doctor saw it, I was referred to a chest x-ray. No fluid appeared on the x-ray, and I was not diagnosed with any illness, but I was given Alvesco (the steriod) to be taken two times a day via inhalation. I stopped taking that first dose of Alvesco a long time ago (maybe 18 months) and have kept the doctor updated throughout my visits for other issues these past two years.\n\nThe cough can sometimes morph into throat clearing (doesn't hurt the chest as much) but is REALLY annoying to everyone around me, so I try to keep to coughing. The cough usually riles up after physical activity, especially in cold weather. There have been times in cold weather when it hurts to breathe, but it usually goes away within an hour.\n\nAfter another visit with the doctor due to an unrelated issue, I was once again prescribed another dose of Alvesco, which was to be taken two times a day via inhalation until the end of May. The Alvesco definetely seemed to help, and the cough was pretty good through May and has been fine up until now, where coughing has become a bit more prevalent. I have also been taking over the counter Menthol cough drops, which help as well. I do not have any photos of the Alvesco inhaler, as it has been recalled by the doctor, and the cough drops are normal.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas on what I could do about this issue? I do not want to be coughing my lungs out every time I do something physical in the cold for the rest of my life (especially as I get older). I do not take any other medication, and I do not indulge in smoking, drinking or recreational drug use.\n\nThanks."""

I had an IUD in 2018-2021, but before then and also after I didnt have any except one excruciatingly heavy one a few months after IUD removal. \n\nAnyways, I also have a lot of other health issues going on. I have a chronic rash on my legs and stomach no one can figure out, even after a biopsy in 2 locations. I have tried every steroid cream, prednisone, and more recently an injection called Kenalog and that did nothing. The prednisone helps a LOT, but it always comes back. \n\nI read kenalog can affect periods, so when I started heavily bleeding all of a sudden, I figured it was a normal reaction to me not having a period for so long and that weird affect. After 3 weeks, and increasingly large blood clots, I called 2 doctors. They both told me to go to the ER. Im very glad I went.\n\n\nThey did an ultrasound which showed my ovarian cyst and thicken endometrial lining. It shouldnt be as thick as it was at 8.2-8.5mm after bleeding so long, is what they told me. \n\nMy white blood cell count is 18k\nMy RBC and differentials are low\nPlatelets are 515\nAnd theres more too\nI also saw rare Polychromasia and blood stippling present\n\nIs this all explainable by anemia? I was also on amoxicillin for my jaw surgery. Th swelling was mostly gone by the time this happened, it was a very unpleasant surgery but not as bad as some jaw surgeries because the tumor was so front and center. I was awake and they only used local anesthesia. \n\nAnyways, I found out after downloading the app for the hospital and seeing my blood work, my blood levels are all over the place. They said to see an OBGYN asap, and I have an appointment next week. \n\nMy question is: how likely is this cancer?\n\nI also have had a jaw bone tumor removed and biopsied that I will be finding out the results of tomorrow, and I am scared it is advanced and metastatic due to the fact that it seems megace / megestrol is used for advanced endometrial cancer according to doctor google :P\n\nBut for real, Id like to be somewhat emotionally prepared, some for myself, but mostly for telling other people. \n\nI really do believe in my gut that it is. My mother had atypical precancerous cells in her uterus by 45, and I have PCOS and a high family his for cancer unfortunately. Plus, my SED rate (50mm/hr) & C Reactive Protein (17.5)  was quite high recently. On top of all of that, I have such severe issues with pain and fatigue right now that I cant even do my laundry properly or grocery shop without getting very dizzy. Ive been desperately trying to get a diagnosis for months because knowing whats wrong could mean not feeling this awful anymore. \n\nOh also I have tachycardia and high blood pressure often, and pre-diabetes (have been pre-diabetic since 15)\n\nIll post a photo of my other blood work in the comments..

At first the doctor thought it was hand foot and mouth disease, but that's not the case now. They can vary from a few small spots, to raised and widespread over her body (or even a combination). It seems to be the worst in the warm months, and less frequent in the cool months. We tried tracking food and medication to see if anything was triggering it but no luck. No medications seem to help (tried allergy meds, steroids, topical creams). Sometimes her hands and feet turn red and swell. Most unusual of all, she says the rash *does not bother her.* She says it does not itch or hurt. She feels fine! We saw an allergist, and while she did have very small reactions to almost everything they tested, the doctor said they were likely false positives. No real answers from the allergist. We saw a pediatric rheumatologist, and they ruled out JRA. We saw a pediatric endocrinologist, and thought maybe she has Hashimoto's but her bloodwork was improved by the time we saw him and he said to follow up in a year. Next step, we are going to see a dermatologist, and maybe infectious disease?? Maybe I shouldn't be so concerned because she says she feels fine.

Today I took it at 330pm just about four hours before I talk my BC. I just woke up with foot cramps Im not cold or dehydrated. I just have cramps in my left foot. And they dont go away with heat, exercise, or massage. Is this a possible drug interaction? I havent seen anything that says I cant take them at the same time. \n\nI have also had weird drug interactions with other drugs. For example Metformin and LoLoEstrine gave me temperature flashes. It seems I may be sensitive to drug interactions but I havent seen literature on either reaction.'"

We were sitting in a house with the door open (my friends live by a river). I noticed I got bit and left it alone. Before we left, I felt a bug bite on my leg too, but then got distracted and forgot about it.\n When I went to bed that night (this past Sunday), I woke up to my arms being SO itchy, as well as my legs, and I realized that I had been bit 7 times. \n Its not abnormal for me to get eaten alive by bugs. Over the past year Ive started to realize just how sensitive I am to mosquitos specifically, but who isnt?   \n I think this next part is relevant to note though: this past summer I got bit 6 times in less than 5 minutes and quickly broke out in huge hives where the bites were at. That was the most intense reaction Ive ever had to a bug bite. \n\n Now since this past Sunday and the 7 initial spots, Ive had a few more bumps form. One on my chest, one on each shoulder, and a bunch on my lower back. Ive been so itchy all over, feeling like new bumps are forming, and the original bites dont seem to be looking better. They seem enlarged even though I havent itched them, the area around them are swollen and red, and some of the bumps look white. \n Even though they dont look like hives I feel like they are. My husband and my friends didnt get bit by anything. I did laundry yesterday thinking maybe I had something on my bedding and clothing, yet I still had new bumps pop up today.\n\nSo my questions:\n- Whether or not theyre hives, if they keep popping up should I see a doctor?\n- Since I do take prescribed adderall, if I wanted to take an antihistamine would there be a drug interaction? There is so much conflicting information about this online. \n- Could I be having a breakout from anything else? Nothing else seems new to me. Only thing I do that is bad for my allergies is eat dairy and wheat all the time, but Ive never broken out in hives from that...\n- Last question and I feel so stupid asking this, but could it possibly be chicken pox even though I had those when I was three? The only images I find that resemble the spots I have are images of chicken pox. I feel like theres no way it could be that though.  \n\nI know I probably seem ridiculous for this lengthy post, but I just dont want to have to see a doctor if I can help it, and Ive never had a reaction like this.

Not sure why?',"b'Hi all\n\nWriting on behalf of my partner who doesn\'t have an account but we\'re looking for some more opinions and advice on what is happening with him. \n\nHe seems to be EXTREMELY sensitive to the cold and has been for a few years now. As soon as we approach winter he essentially catches a cold that doesn\'t fully go away until winter ends and the weather changes. He is exhausted, congested, sore throat and coughing. No fever or body aches. He is always freezing and wears multiple layers, socks, beanie, multiple blankets and heater on and will still often be cold. He is miserable and we really want to try and figure out what to do for him. It never develops into a full blown flu or infection or anything, just this constant mid range sort of cold symptoms that don\'t go away. Medicine doesn\'t seem to help at all he just sort of deals with it as best as possible til spring comes and it eases off. It definitely seems seasonal. But it disrupts his life and his mental health as it affects everyday life, work and training.\n\nHe has been ""symptomatic"" the past couple of weeks and I\'ve not caught anything he might have so it doesn\'t seem contagious. I\'m hesitant to really call it a sickness as it seems more like a reaction he doesn\'t pass onto anyone. \n\nWe also believe he has Raynaud\'s because his fingers and toes go white and numb and he can\'t move them if exposed to the cold, this happens regardless of season, even in summer if he goes in really cold water it happens.\n\nInfo/background on him: he\'s 35, Australian/Italian, living in Australia, around 170cm tall and 75kg weight. No smoking or drinking or drugs. Rarely eats ""junk food"" and is quite health conscious. Eats meat, fruit, veggies, eggs and small amounts of bread/grains. He trains martial arts usually around 2 hours a day and works in some weight lifting sessions too. Sleeps usually 8 hours, though it\'s more when this sickness comes on. He usually wakes up jumping out of bed but as soon as this sets in he struggles to wake up and sleeps in more hours then still wakes up groggy which is not like him the rest of the year. \n\nIt\'s almost like clockwork!\n\nHe has had bloodwork done which didn\'t show anything, doctors don\'t seem motivated or invested to help and constantly just want to send him for blood tests. He did traditional Chinese medicine for a few months last winter which he did seem to have some response to but ultimately didn\'t cure anything and everything disappeared once the weather warmed up so there\'s nothing there to treat at that point. And it\'s back a year later.. He thrives in summer and loves hot Australian summer weather haha. The rest of the year he is rarely sick at all.\n\nAt this point we\'re just kinda stuck on what to do or how to manage it but want to try get to the bottom of it. \n\nOur first baby is due in a little over 2 months which is mid winter and he really doesn\'t want to be feeling like this in general let alone when our baby is born. \n\nThankful for any thoughts and opinions '"

In mid April, my wife noticed a small bruise-like mark on the back/interior side of my left knee. At first I thought it was a small bruise earned during house work or me just being dumb - but turned out it never went away. I have a picture taken a few days after I noticed it - and a picture taken a few days ago. Looks about the same - hasn\'t changed in size. No pain, no swelling, and the area is not warm/hot to the touch - only knew it was there because my wife saw it. Is it raised? No, its totally flat. Has it changed in size or location since first notice? Nope. Do have anything else like this on my body or have I in the past? Nope. Has anything major changed in my life in the last 6 months? Yes, I have been dieting and exercising considerable more then I have in the last 6-7 years, I have been for about 3 months consistently now. I also stopped drinking anything with caffeine about 5 months ago (apparently it helped fix a lot of my anxiety issues). Does it change in color? Yup, all the time. So if I am laying down for a while, its color fades away until is rather hard to even notice but you can still see it. If I stand up and put weight on my leg, I notice this purple-ish color return. Logically - I believed this meant it has something to do with my veins or circulation? I have a 3rd photo but this 3rd image was taken like 2 years ago (and its extremely poor quality so not worth posting). To my eyes, it looks like its the same ""mark"" in the same place which may mean I have had this for a few years and never noticed it. I can not be 100% sure that is accurate but thought it may be worth noting. Do I think it just showed up? Unknown - only relevant statement I can offer on that is she noticed it right when I switched over from my long pants to shorts all the time due to spring weather. That makes me think it may have been there for a while before. Either way - I will ask my primary about it, but that appointment was supposed to be today and they delayed it another month on me, so wondering about this is starting to weigh on me. Images below.\n\nI do not have a history of bad bruising, and I have no known issues with circulation, heart issues, blood clotting, or anything else like that - and yes I have yearly check ups with the docs. \n\nIf any of this rings a bell to anyone, would be most welcome to get some feed back!

Obviously I'm not a doctor but I can't help the feeling that something more is wrong or something is being missed. Here is a general timeline of how the issue has progressed and treatments I've received. I have been extremely consistent with lid care over the entire course of this (No makeup, Ocusoft lid scrub, warm compresses with a sock filled with rice for about 15 mins once a day when my symptoms aren't terrible, up to 3 times a day when symptoms are at their worst).  \nSeptember 2022 - Stye on my left upper lid margin, had a white head that would drained itself and refilled multiple times over a few weeks. I was prescribed Ofloxacin eye drops twice by my PCP during this time.  \nNovember/December 2022 - Early November the stye progressed to a large chalazion on the middle of my eyelid. This was pretty painful/swollen, was referred to an ophthalmologist for this, and received a Kenalog injection in December. This helped with the inflammation but was still left with a small white lump on my eyelid just above my eyelashes. Was told that I could return for either a second injection to resolved the remaining bump or drainage if the symptoms got worse  \nJanuary 2023 - Bump in the middle of my lid became very swollen/red/painful again so I returned to the ophthalmologist, he inverted my eyelid and said he couldn't really see an area to drain from the inside of my eyelid, so we opted to do a second steroid injection since it seemed to somewhat help the first time. The swelling went down, but after a few days a second large painful bump started growing on the nasal inner corner of my eyelid. Emailed the doctor and he said it could just be a reaction to the steroid, but then prescribed neomycin/polymixin/dexamethasone eye drops. Both the bump in the middle and the new one in the corner never fully went eye drops since it wasn't getting better after a couple days. Also was put on Doxycyline for 10 days but didn't notice any difference with this either.  \nMarch 2023 - Both the bump in the middle and the new one in the corner did get smaller but never fully went away and both had white heads on the surface of the skin. Was referred to an NP to do a drainage. They were both drained through the surface of my eyelid in March and she said oily material and scar tissue were removed. The middle bump seemed to completely go away after this and the one in the corner was considerably smaller but still had a small area of swelling/redness.  \nMay 2023 - Follow up with NP and she said I likely have eyelid rosacea, MBD, and also diagnosed allergic conjunctivitis. Was told to use olopatadine drops 2x/day, neomycin/polymixin/dexamethasone ointment 3x/day to help reduce the remaining inflammation and scar, and erythromycin ointment at bedtime. After using the steroid ointment for a few days both bumped on my lid started becoming inflamed, red, and irritated again. NP said I could stop the steroid ointment but it feels like I am back at square one with this entire issue.  \nSorry for this extremely long post! I want to include as much info as possible. I'm just worried that this feels like it's something more than just chalazia. I have never had significant eye issues or dry eyes in the past, so this all seems to have come out of nowhere.  \nhttps://imgur.com/a/YjiNO6q some photos of how this has progressed"""

Pheochromocytoma???'","b'Hey there docs. Looking for some peace of mind or any advice on what could be causing my symptoms. I\'m 29, 185lbs, female. History of depression and anxiety, most specifically health OCD (which definitely isn\'t helping me here).\n\nSeveral weeks ago my doctor prescribed me fluvoxamine 25mg to help with my OCD. I took it for ten days, then realized I was taking it everyday with an allergy pill (10mg loratadine). I\'ve previously had allergic reactions to antidepressants so I decided to stop taking the allergy meds to see if I would react to the fluvox. A couple days later I started feeling my scalp and ears itch, so I stopped taking the fluvox. \n\nA couple days after stopping the fluvox, I started experiencing what I can only describe as hot flashes. It was localized to my chest and neck. My skin was not red or sweaty at all, but I felt extremely hot and feverish. No fever though! I used wonderful Google diagnostic tools (I know, I know...) and discerned I was suffering from withdrawal from the fluvox, so I took it again for two days (this was last week - Tuesday and Wednesday). I was still having the hot flashes so I talked to my doctor on Thursday. She suspected a drug reaction and told me to stop taking the fluvox, which I did. My last dose of fluvox was last Wednesday. The hot flashes stopped on Thursday last week. \n\nSaturday night (one week ago today) I took a diazepam to calm down, as I was having a hard time falling asleep. No issues there, however, Tuesday morning of THIS week, the ""hot flashes"" returned - note, that when I say hot flashes, I mean my chest/neck/left side of face randomly get very hot and stay that way for hours. \n\nI became concerned so I went in to my doctor on Thursday (two days ago today). She said that either I am still reacting to the fluvox, or there\'s a chance I could have something called pheochromocytoma. Naturally that scared the heck out of me. \n\nAfter researching the heck out of everything to try and calm myself down, I came across the fact that fluvox and diazepam have very strong interactions. I am wondering if taking them a couple of days apart could be causing this hot flash reaction. Or...could this be a hormonal issue? Or something else? CBC a month ago was completely normal. Thyroid panel done last year was normal. \n\nRelevant past medical history. Had a total hysterectomy done in December (kept my ovaries). LEEP procedure done in December 2020 due to pre cancerous cells on my cervix.

I bring it up throughout the day, and it\'s very thick. I took NAC for twenty days and I felt much better. I asked the doctor if I could try Carbocisteine because even though I felt better than I did beforehand on NAC, I felt as if the effect didn\'t last long enough. Therefore I asked to go on Carbocisteine. My doctor obliged, and I started taking the Carbocisteine.\n\nOn the day that I started taking Carbocisteine (19th of July), I noticed a few tiny blood blisters near my armpit and on the crook of my left elbow. I didn\'t think much of it because these were tiny and could have berm caused by anything. I continued to take the Carbocisteine until the 24th of July when it became obvious I was having some sort of reaction.\n\nI had developed several of the blisters, that can be seen in the link I posted, on my armpits, arms, crooks of my elbows and a few on my torso. I phoned the doctor\'s that advised me to stop with the Carbocisteine. This was on Wednesday.\n\nThe blisters were completely clear and they weren\'t painful at all.\n\nI had a doctor\'s appointment on the Friday the 26th of July, and I explained the situation. The blisters had already begun to disappear for the most part by then. I could barely find one to show the doctor.\n\nHe seemed surprising unconcerned by my apparent reaction to the drug. I expressed my concerns of going back onto NAC since it\'s closely related to Carbocisteine. He said ""You won\'t know if you\'ll have a reaction unless you try it."" So with that, I started taking NAC again.\n\nThat lasted until the 30th of July. The blisters had returned, although to a lesser extent, and I had developed an all over body itch to boot. The itch mainly affected my face, hair, nose, and torso.\n\nThe blisters disappeared again rather quickly after stopping taking NAC, but the itching remained. Around this time, my eyes started itching a bit and getting sticky. My throat was a little sore as well.\n\nI read somewhere that antihistamines can help an itch brought on by NAC, so I started self medicating withLoratadine, which I had in the house anyway because I suffer from hay-fever. This helped with the itchiness.\n\nMy symptoms subsided after a week, so I thought that was the end of it. I started my keto diet again, which I initially took a break from while taking the NAC. Within a few days I began itching again, albeit not as bad as before, and I noticed a few more blisters. This was last Thursday. I stopped the keto diet and this improved the itchiness and the blisters full disappeared.\n\nI thought that must have been it, but today I found three more blisters on my armpits despite not having taking either drug for nearly two weeks. My itch seems to be returning as well.\n\nDoes this seem sound like Steven Johnson Syndrome? Apparently, that\'s a possible side effect of both of these drugs. If not, could it be another sort of drug reaction?\n\nThank you for reading.'"

Ive gotten biopsies and more medication prescriptions than I can count because I was getting a severe allergic reaction to something since 2019 and it got progressively worse over the years and was a near daily occurrence. \nUltimately, I figured out on my own that I am allergic to allergy medication. I have cat allergies and was taking cetrizine almost daily for years before the outbreak of small, flat hives started that, at first, only appeared on my hands and then progressed over many years to everywhere else on my body. I dont know if this is a factor, but these symptoms started after a very bad and traumatic breakup that caused me severe depression and anxiety and required therapy to heal from. \nAnyways, when I finally started putting the pieces together, every doctor gaslit me and told me its rare if not impossible to be allergic to allergy medicine so thats likely not it. But the condition went away the moment I stopped and comes back a few hours after I take it. \nThat being said, I still need allergy medication because I love my cat and Im allergic to her - its nothing severe just lots of sneezing and stuffy nose particularly in the mornings but otherwise gets better throughout the day. Cetrizine and Claritin have this effect on me. The only medication that doesnt is Benadryl but I was told you cant take Benadryl too frequently. So what should I do? \nTLDR: Allergic to cetrizine and claritin. Benadryl doesnt seem to have negative affect but was told you cant take it often and it only lasts 12 or so hours. What do I do to combat cat allergies? (if you say get rid of the cat pls know that I would rather die than do that. She has saved me from the brink of suicide and severe depression and has been with me through the hardest and best years of my life).'"

I have had some red rash marks that were not that itchy for a few months prior to this that the doctor said was likely eczema so I started treating with aproderm ointment (which still has yet to resolve fully). I started using aproderm cream that I\'d bought instead of the ointment a few days ago, because I felt the ointment was really messy and sticky. I don\'t know if this is related at all to this new rash but a few days ago I noticed my legs were really itchy and had slight redness on my upper thighs. I\'d had quite bad night sweats the previous night (not sure if related but I get night sweats very often that I\'ve been tested for and came back fine so the jury is still out on that one). I wasn\'t sure what the cause of the rash was but I went to a pharmacy and tried to show a picture but it\'s very hard to take one that shows the rash well enough. He said it could be sweat rash and to use sudocrem. Started doing this, after which yesterday it was starting to look worse. The rash had spread slightly down my thigh/legs and the itchiness hadn\'t improved much. I went to a different pharmacy, tried to show a picture and they said they couldn\'t tell but maybe to try taking a stronger antihistamine (fexofenadine) than the one I\'m on (I take regular cetirizine usually.)  \nSo I took their advice and started the new antihistamine tablet last night. Over night I had terrible anxiety, bad dreams and night sweats, but waking up I didn\'t feel great (however this can happen if I have a bad night sleep). I have a sliiight headache (not enough to take meds), and I felt very hot earlier but I think that might have been the anxiety. I don\'t know now if this was caused by the new antihistamine tablet or perhaps because there\'s something else going on. The rash itself is still there and looks kind of worse actually today. I tried to see if it blanched but I can\'t honestly tell, as it looks like there\'s weird pink heads that still show up, but it doesn\'t LOOK like meningitis, however I\'m scared it might be lol.  \n\n\nI do have health anxiety so obviously I\'ve been a little panicky over what this rash might be. Since it\'s been a few days and I\'m not in a terrible state health-wise yet I imagine it can\'t be too serious but I still don\'t know why it\'s not clearing with the sudocrem/antihistamines. I also wish I knew whether it\'s a reaction to something or an allergy or even a viral thing??? I did get back from a trip to Japan/South Korea on the 16th April but I don\'t know if it\'s relevant, just figured it worth mentioning. My partner is fine tho and has no issues/rashes/anything.  \n\n\nI\'ve added a few photos but honestly I\'ve been struggling to take a good one as it doesn\'t seem to show up well.

I have tried to lose weight in the past but it doesn\'t stay off even with diet changes. I have ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder, and IBS. I don\'t smoke, drink, or take any non prescribed medications. \n\nI, 24F, had my gallbladder removed laproscopically 5 weeks ago on Monday. For some backstory, a large singular gallstone was found during an ultrasound of my abdomen to look at my liver. I had recently gotten poor liver numbers on my annual blood results in December and similar results on the requested follow up blood test a month later in January. It took a while to get everything scheduled but I had my gallbladder out through a benefit my company uses called Surgery Plus. I don\'t have to pay for anything, just had to go to their closest qualified surgeon that was over 3 hours away (they also paid for my gas!). I was told as long as I had no complications I didn\'t need to follow up in person and could do a phone appointment. \n\nPost surgery I was in a lot of pain. I\'m on pain meds already for chronic pain and took the prescribed opioids. Wasn\'t thrilled about taking an opioid, but was in so much pain I couldnt sleep or take a deep breath. I pushed water drinking a small glass every 45 minutes, and also walked for 15 minutes before setting my watch timer for 30 minutes of rest. I was miserable but had to be back at work 7 days post op. My dad came to stay with me so he could walk my dog, I live in an apartment and he wanted to be sure I could manage everything before he left. The night he was supposed to leave my glue came off my incisions and I noticed one had some pussy discharge. This alarmed me and I called my aunt who is a nurse. She told me to send a picture and was very worried since the skin surrounding the incision was red and puffy, she called it \'angry looking\' and wanted me to send photos to the surgeon. In the meantime she told me to keep it covered with gauze. I was told there would be no wound care, so luckily I keep a decently stocked first aid kit. \n\nI sent a message to the nurse describing the discharge and attached photos of all the incisions. All incisions were now open since the glue fell off. I had to wear work pants which rubbed on two of the four incisions and the one on my chest would also produce fluid I was worried would get on my work shirt. I work in the leasing office downstairs, so while I have to dress nice I could go upstairs to change bandages which I made sure to change in the morning before going down. I got a call from the nurse around 2 pm. She told me to leave it uncovered and that I didn\'t need to do anything unless it continues to produce pus (clear ish discharge when I looked in the morning) and I should take off the bandage I had on when I got home immediately. I told her it was hard for it to scab over when it\'s on the hem of my pants. She sounded annoyed and told me she supposed I could cover it when I was working but make sure that was the ONLY time it was not open to the air. My aunt was annoyed but my parents suggested I follow my nurse\'s advice since she deals with post surgical wounds more often. My aunt did look at the other pictures and said the border looked red and angry on all the incisions, so I probably had a reaction to the adhesive which could\'ve caused irritation causing the glue to come off early before it was really ready. \n\nWell this was Tuesday or Wednesday and my post Op was the following Monday. Meanwhile my dad left and I had an allergic reaction to the adhesive of the surgical bandaids (it was marketed as a large gauze with long lasting tape along the entire border for a full seal) my dad got me. I\'ve had adhesive reactions before, normally to specific bandaid brands that are often knock off brands like Kroger. I kept it uncovered until Monday, but the scab came off in the shower every evening when cleaning off the incisions even though I never scrubbed the area directly with anything other than a gentle lather with soap and my hand. \n\nThe surgeon called me for my post-op and told me he heard I had some discharge. At this point my top incision had a similar one day of pussy discharge which then returned to normal, though the puffy red border on this one had actually opened so the open line from the incision now was about the size of a quarter and looked pretty deep in the area that had just opened. He told me to keep them all covered at all times with gauze and Neosporin, no airing it out at all. I was confused, but he did say any benefits from a scab wouldn\'t apply if it fell off every day so maybe the nurse didn\'t think it would? I felt frustrated since I had been trying to deal with discharge from the nightly open wounds and hoping it scabbed before I put work clothes on for almost 6 days at this point. \n\nMeanwhile this same week, week 3 post-op, my anxiety that I was initially told was pretty normal post-op as anesthesia worked its way through your system went to a level it hasn\'t been since high school. I broke out over my entire body. I also have a skin-picking disorder and couldn\'t leave these new bumps alone, so I was now also covered constantly in blood from picking at bumps and scabs. I also have ingrown toenails and was nightly convincing myself I was helping and then being almost unable to walk the next day. Ever since I had returned home I was not able to get to bed until 1 or 2 am, I just wasn\'t tired and couldn\'t wind down. Then I would realize the time, go to bed, then spend an hour picking at my arms no matter what I tried to do to stop myself. Each night got later until I was sleeping 3-4 hours each night and barely able to function in the morning, but wide-awake by dinner. My dog also got sick so I\'d finally get to sleep and then he\'d wake me up at 4 am to make me rush him outside to be sick. \n\nMy aunt wanted me to book a doctor\'s appointment when last week I still had the one top incision open. She wanted me to make sure there was no infection or something they wanted me to do. Again I was told not to cover it and not to even put Neosporin on it. My aunt mentioned after this appointment when I called to chat that Neosporin can actually slow healing, she just didn\'t want to overwhelm me with another conflicting message. Back to the appointment, he said it looked absolutely fine and couldn\'t get any discharge out so not to worry, some wounds just take longer to heal. He then put the bandaid across the part of my skin that was totally raw and bleeding from over 2 weeks straight of paper tape, even though there was a section that was okay. I then asked him about my sleep and he asked me why I thought that was happening. I told him my aunt brought up that thyroids can get out of wack post-suegery, and to have my cortisol and a general thyroid panel run. He told me it was too late to take cortisol that day, so to come back. Then offered a temporary, non-addictive sleeping pill. I took it twice and didn\'t notice a difference except having a hard time getting up. Well upon googling it doesn\'t help you fall asleep or get sleepy, just stay asleep. That\'s not what I told him I had problems with, and it actually was just causing me to not be able to get up even when taking over 8 hours before my alarm. \n\nI\'m frustrated, not sleeping, feeling like a teen with this acne that I can\'t leave alone, and feeling so anxious I also feel like a teen again not able to cope and constantly using ticks like hair playing or skin picking to get a break from the anxiety (though I don\'t always realize I\'m doing it). I don\'t know if anyone can help, but I don\'t know what to do. I\'m also interviewing for jobs right now and doing the job of several coworkers who are out sick/not there for various reasons. I can\'t keep going this way and need some ideas at least as to how to get myself through this.'"

However, my face and the top of my scalp were not affected, and my arms and legs did not experience any itching either, except for the creased areas (possibly where sweat glands are located).\n\nFluconazole is supposed to eliminate all types of fungus, and I suspect it may be affecting these areas with sweat glands, leading to the allergic reaction in this specific pattern.\n\nAfter four weeks, the condition improved, although there was still some slight itching, mainly in my armpits.

I do not smoke or drink, and I do not take any form of drugs. I am from Poland, EU. I experienced the death of my father pesonally in 2020 and he died due to COVID. I consider myself a stressful person, but I am working on improvement. I exercise a lot (although without a gym becuase there is no gym where I live) at home.\n\n   First, something that happened that might or might not have influence over my issue. When I was a little child I went with my dad to drive electric go karts on a race for kids, and I remember I hit myself really hard in the chest with the driving wheel because we crashed against another kart. I had an ache in that area for about a month I remember, then it was gone. I didn\'t tell my parents about that.\n\nNOW THE ACTUAL ISSUE:\n\nCONTEXT:   As of writing this, I\'m experiencing it. I don\'t know if it\'s breathlessness, but what it is is I just have to take a deep breath or yawn every 1-2 minutes. Besides that I\'m pretty groggy and tired/sleepy. As of writing this, I have been experiencing this for over 12 hours (started yesterday 3pm). I have no other symptoms.\n\n   It is worth mentioning that I had infectious mononucleosis AND COVID consecutively last year\'s summer and I experienced breathlessness several times AFTER COVID, not during it. I\'ve become very stressed about my health since then.\n\n   I\'ve been to a pulmonologist and to a cardiologist regarding these issues several times (I actually booked another appointment with another pulmonologist). I was not diagnosed for any issues with both of the systems. I was deemed healthy, with suspicions of being depressed or anxious. I took an X ray photo of my chest as well (immediately after COVID) and it revealed nothing to be worried about (healthy lungs and heart) \\[on the photo there was a black spot next between my heart and lungs, but my pulmonologist deemed it an error on the photo\\].\n\nISSUE: Like I said, I don\'t know if it\'s random breathlessness (even if I don\'t feel anxious) or what, but I feel air hunger and the need to take deep breaths almost every 1-2 minutes. I have no other symptoms besides that. I am experiencing it right now, I experienced it last week for 1-2 hours two times, other than that last time I had it was in december last year. It really bothers and concerns me because it feels really uncomfortable.\n\n   Something I wanted to add and that has been bothering me a lot as well, but this I\'ve been experiencing my whole life. DEEP BREATHING. It is hard to describe but I will try my best:\n\n1. I take one, filling deep breath. If I try to take another deep breath right after, the next one is not as filling - it feels like only my chest gets air.\n2. If I try to force myself to breathe in more, I don\'t get more air and I get an urge to yawn.\n3. When I yawn, I either cannot take a full deep yawn or I can. If the FIRST happens, I keep the urge to yawn and try to yawn again afterwards. I don\'t yawn, I try to sigh or just take several shallow breaths, and the urge goes away.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT thing: it feels as if I have a blockade around the trachea area and no matter how much air I try to inhale, I feel it. The trachea blockade feels like a mild ""pain"" (it feels the exact same way something heavy is put on your body).\n\nI am really bothered by these things. This is my first post here so please don\'t judge harshly. I will provide any information you need below if you ask me. I WILL REALLY APPRECIATE IF ANYONE TELLS ME IF I SHOULD BE WORRIED OR NOT.

I was already on losartan 50 mg for blood pressure, the met was added to that.\n\nBetween the two of them my BP and heart rate came down to about 110/70, pulse of about 70 most of the time. The first 3 weeks went ok but then I started getting REALLY constipated. \nFor the record, before the metoprolol I have never have a serious problem with my bowels. On just losartan I could almost set my watch by when I pooped in the AM. My diet is healthy, with plenty of fluids and fiber.\n\nIt really got bad last week so I took a packet of Miralax last Tuesday evening. Within 2 hours my blood pressure spiked from 110/70 to 150/90 and stayed there, give or take 10 points, for 8 DAYS. In addition to the high BP I felt surges of adrenalin most of the time, including teeth-chattering shakes when I wasn\'t cold, anxiety, racing heart, etc. \n\nI assumed it was the Miralax and that I was sensitive to it (though I had a colonoscopy 5 years ago with that used a PEG solution as a cleanout and didn\'t have an issue with it then). It got better the evening before last, and then yesterday was a really good BP day again (back to 110/70), only I was again constipated to the point of concrete. \n\nLast night I took 1 single regular strength Senokot pill and 2 hours later my BP was up 20 points both systolic and diastolic.  This morning it was 145/76 and topped out at 160/85 this afternoon. \nI contacted my cardiologist today and we\'re switching meds, no more metoprolol for me.\n\nWhat I want to know is WHY this happened? It seems clear now that, after reactions to 2 completely different laxatives, this is not probably specific to the laxatives but something gone haywire in the gut signalling and the hormones influenced/blocked by metoprolol.  I\'m concerned I might have this same reaction to the whole class of drugs (beta blockers) so I\'d like to understand the scientific reason if anyone can figure it out.\n\nFeel free to completely nerd out on me, I really want to know and I have a degree in biology. And DON\'T tell me this is impossible, I have detailed BP/med/dietary logs  from the last month to prove it happened to me, and they have been shared with my cardio team. \n\nThanks!'"

Overtime, this is grew to me waking up in the middle of the night due to how itchy it can be. It doesn't really itch any other time, and while lotion and vaseline help it a little bit, it doesnt solve the over all issue of it not being healed. On top of that, they will occasionally grow some dead skin over it, to which it all peels off instead of forming into skin that would heal over it. At first I kinda thought it could have been some sort of rash.\n\nAnyone got any ideas? This has sucked for the entire duration, and a lot of the stuff I do outside of work is hindered by the uncomfort from them.\n\nAnd before anyone asks, I do where gloves at work. Not like work gloves, like the kind that are latex or whatever. I didn't wear them before this, however I don't believe that's linked. They started around the time I started receiving a few cuts and burns from work, but there are spots in places I didn't receive those. I also don't think it's an allergic reaction kind of thing, as i've never been allergic to anything that i've ever known about. If any more background info is needed i'll gladly answer.\n\nPicture for reference.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13k8lfo/episodes_of_numbness_and_muscle_constriction/,b'Episodes of numbness and muscle constriction after eating',"b'30M, 6\' 2"", 141lbs, no smoking, I do drink, no drugs, no existing known medical issues\n\nI have been having this issue for probably 8 years or so, but recently in the past 2 years there were two more extreme episodes. It is always triggered by food while eating out. I have never had this happen while at home or eating at any friends places. What usually happens is while eating or shortly after I will start to feel a tingling sensation in my face and particularly my lips and eyes. It\'s a bit odd but usually doesn\'t bother me that much and goes away within 10-30 mins. This probably happens like maybe 1 once in two months so not super common. I have not been able to find a pattern with what food triggers it, but I would guess it\'s more fatty food with lots of butter and oil added into it. \n\nSo to the more extreme episodes, in Feb of 2022 me and some friends stayed in an air bnb for a weekend and the Sunday after we were headed back home and got food at Panera. I had a egg and sausage sandwich and some coffee, so nothing super crazy. I could tell pretty much right away that my face was getting tingly and I was like whatever this will go away pretty soon. I started driving back with my girlfriend in the car and after like 10 mins of driving I told her I needed to pull over at the next exit because it was spreading to the rest of my body and didn\'t feel safe driving. We stopped I got some water and by that point I was feeling pretty weird. I was finding it hard to move properly, my speech was slurred, my vision was getting somewhat blurry. Most of my muscles were constricting and felt super stiff. My fingers looked super skinny because the muscles were so tight. It never really hurt, but it was very scary and we went to the ER. The nurse took my blood pressure and did some basic tests and said I was probably not going to die so I had to wait. They said there was no swelling or anything so it was very unlikely to be an allergic reaction to something. After like an hour, I was starting to feel back to normal and people had been there for going on 4 hours so I decided to leave because whatever was going on was done and I would just go see a doctor back home. (unrelated but they charged me $2200 just for a nurse to take my blood pressure... Just wanted to point out how insane that is. First time going to an ER. 5 mins of work for that much money. Feel really badly for the old lady that had been there for 4 hours who was in a ton of pain the whole time.)\n\nAt home my doctor had me do a bunch of testing stuff, but she has no idea what the issue could be. I had blood labs, ct head scan, ultra sound of chest arteries, and they call came back normal. She wants me to go see a neurologist, which I am going to do, but I am doubtful they will have any good ideas either.\n\nThroughout the next year I probably only had 1 or 2 other very minor occurrences with just my face having some very minor tingling. Then 2 weeks ago had another bigger episode not as bad as the one a year ago, but still scary. I had pretty much the same symptoms as the first time just not quite as bad. I didn\'t go to the ER for that one because it started getting better by the time I was about to say we should leave the restaurant. I had fish and chips to eat this time.\n\nOther things to note, I did drink fairly heavily the previous night in both instances. If I were to guess maybe 6-8 beers. That doesn\'t seem to be needed for the more minor occurrences, but figured it worth mentioning. I don\'t usually drink that much. I think I have pretty bad blood flow to my extremities. My hands and feet are always freezing and in winter they can go super pale and numb after just a few minutes in cold weather. Looks pretty freaky, but this doesn\'t bother me that much. I like to think I have ok diet and exercise but it could probably be better. I just had a yearly check up today which is when my doc wanted to go see a neurologist since it is an ongoing issue and somewhat scary. I will also say it feels very similar to if I throw up while sick. I haven\'t been that sick since I was a kid, but I remember puking one time and all of my muscles ended up constricting right after and I was stuck curled in a ball on the floor for a good 20 mins.\n\nMainly just wanted to see if anyone else had any ideas, since my doctor is stumped.'"

Tentatively diagnosed with Cyclothimia/Bipolar II\n\nI take a daily dose of Quetiapine 50 mg and Sertraline 50 mg.\n\nA month ago (april 16th) I had a course of pharyngitis with a fever of 39C (102.2F) and was prescribed Levofloxacin 500 mg, 1 dose x 7 days and Acetaminophen 500 mg, every 8 hrs x 3 days.\n\nThe infection seemed to solve and felt well afterwards, however, I started to experience some heavy peeling on the palms of my hands, which persisted until a few days ago.\n\nOn may 11th, some days ago, I started to feel unwell again. I started do develop a pruritic rash on the trunk, very inflammed neck lymph nodes and a horrible sore throat (damned pharyngitis once again).

I asked her if it could be a Scarlet Fever.\n\nShe said it wasn\'t possible to have bacterial infections that close and told me she had absolutely no idea what was going on with me and couldn\'t explain the rash. She also told me it definitively wasn\'t a Scarlet Fever.\n\nShe said maybe it was an allergic reaction and prescribed me Loratadine 10 mg, 1 dose x 10 days and Metamizole 500 mg, every 8 hrs x 4 days.\n\nI did take the medication, but started feeling a way worse and the rash kept spreading to my limbs.\n\nSymptoms weren\'t going away, I started to have a slight runny nose and a plugged ear, and afterwards, another sign of a Scarlet Fever: a strawberry tougue.\n\nStrawberry toungue: https://imgur.com/oV02X6v\n\nI decided to go to the doctor again. This doctor is a friend of my family and he\'s ""the golden standard"" of a doctor according to my dad. This doctor also knows I\'m a medschool student.\n\nAnyways, he inspected me and actually asked me if I had an idea of what could be happening to me.\n\nOnce again, I asked him if it could be a Scarlet Fever by a damned S. Pyogenes.\n\nHe said I was right about the Streph, and that I very likely had a badly treated Streph Throat. \n\nBut then again, he negated the rash as a Scarlet Fever and asked me to take a **febrile reactions test** (uh... ok?) test to discard a potential Typhoid Fever and Roseola by a consecuence of it.\n\nHe prescribed me:\n\n* Azithromycin 500 mg, 1 dose x 3 days; \n* Ibuprofen 500 mg, every 8 hrs x 4 days;\n* Levocetirazine 5 mg, every 12 hrs x 2 days.\n\nI took the meds. Today I took my last dose of the antibiotic and currently feel better.\n\nThe result of the febrile reactions came back today as well. **It marked Typhic O positive, with 1:80 units, all other values were negative.**\n\nI sent it to the doc and told me it was positive to Salmonella Typhi. \n\nI doubted it a lot, they had told me in medschool those values could come positive in that range if the patient went a Salmonellosis course at some point in their life (I did, 7 years ago).\n\nThey also taught me that the mexican population will most likely present a range of 1:60 - 1:80 because of the huge Salmonella Typhi presence in the country.\n\nHe prescribed me Moxifloxacin 400 mg, 1 dose x 5 days.\n\nAditionally, he said I should take some prebiotics because that quinolone is going to fuck up with my gut bacteria. He said I MUST take the medication because of the Typhoid Fever.\n\nHonestly, I don\'t know what to do next. I don\'t know if I should take antibiotics again; my parents are pressuring me to do so.\n\nI feel kinda lost here, they trust this doctor ( I don\'t) and not me and my inconvenient with the medication.\n\nShould I go foward and take the antibiotic even though I feel well again?\n\nAgain, I\'m just a student, I acknowledge I\'m still very naive on this field, but at least I have some notion now.

Nonspecific Lucent Lesion was noted initially incidentally on a CT scan in 2019 when I had a bad reaction to a medication and was hospitalized and had mental status changes. They didnt mention a size of the lesion so I have nothing to compare the new finding to, and docs seemed unconcerned at the time/didnt feel a need to monitor it. They didnt even tell me about it actually, I only found out when I read the report out of curiosity and followed up myself months later, after which I was told ""don\'t worry, it\'s probably just a larger than normal vein"". A CT years prior made no mention of it. Is this normal? Is it something that I should insist continues to be monitored even if the rest of the testing from this round suggests it hasn\'t grown?\n\n2. Can a hemangioma of the skull cause neurological symptoms? It still seems pretty small (2cm x 2cm) so is that even enough to make a difference? I dont want to be chasing leads that dont exist.\n\n3. Had MRI today, lesion was noted again in more detail this time. Said it looked like the inner and outer table were intact but remodeled and that there was also possible evidence of expansion. Osseous hemangioma was listed as the likely cause but was unconfirmed and they recommended a CT and potentially a bone scan in the MRI notes. I thought MRIs were pretty good at identifying these things though and I dont understand how they cant be sure from the MRI if the CT scan from 2019 also didn\'t seem very confident. Which imaging is better for this sort of thing? Should I trust the 2019 CT was adequate? I feel like if it was growing it would probably be bigger by now and causing a lot more problems, right?\n\n4. How urgent is this? Is this a call my primary doctor tomorrow if they dont call me first sort of thing? Im just unsure because this doesnt seem to fall into the category of the specialist doctor that ordered the MRI in the first place and may or may not be related to the ear symptoms I have been experiencing- the ears turned up fine on the MRI. Im not sure if this doctor will follow up in a timely manner if its unrelated to his practice/what he was looking for.\n\nThank you.'"

I don\'t know how long she had been taking it, 3) She had been experiencing unexplained falls for a year or two, possibly because she took 150mg atenolol per day. (At the time I didn\'t know she was taking atenolol.)\n\nCurrent medications: Losartan, bumetanide, Aricept*, Gabapentin**\n\nHealth habits: \n\nShe and her husband walked their dogs one mile every day, at a medium-slow pace. She drank white wine and ate salads, chicken, salmon, fruit, and vegetables.\n\nIn February, 2016, an 82 year old woman was taken to the emergency room at a prestigious teaching hospital after falling with (probable) loss of consciousness. She had a 1.5 cm laceration on her scalp, which was the given reason for the ambulance (which a distant daughter had summoned in a fit of neurosis). The scene suggested that she\'d hit her head on the edge of a door as she fell, and that she landed on a plush, padded carpet. She didn\'t get up until her husband finally found her. She was conscious but weak. She was conversant.\n\nShe was admitted not long after she arrived at the ER because she failed the orientation quiz, which asked her name (which she stated), her birthday (which she didn\'t state) and what city she was in (which she also didn\'t state). She hasn\'t known her birthday for decades, because she doesn\'t believe in celebrating them. It\'s a quirk, not a strange religious practice. Plus, she lives in a big county with many small cities, and ambulances have no windows.) \n\nShe underwent various tests, including x-rays and a CT-scan of her skull, ultrasound for deep-vein thrombosis, blood work, and ekg. She was given IV fluids. \n\nThe first mention of drugs is notes made on the morning of day two. A nurse called her pharmacy and was told or misheard that the woman was on 50 mg of Atenolol per day. Because she probably for none on the day she fell, and because that\'s a big dose reduction, it\'s possible that what happened next was she went experienced panic and anxiety as a symptom of atenolol withdrawal. The staff say she was combative and wanted to get out of bed in the morning. In that order. I didn\'t know you had to engage in hand-to-hand combat to get out of bed in a hospital these days, but times change.\n\nA resident ordered intramuscular haloperidol on the morning of day 2. The records only mention one injection, but when she got home two days later, a friend who visited said she looked ""drugged."" \n\nSo the high dose of Atenolol and the abrupt drop from 150 mg to 50 mg is one drug event, and the haloperidol is another. I was wondering if the atenolol dose change, or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            the Iv haldol could gave caused\n\nGraphics and P.S.s\nWhen she got home, her feet were badly swollen. They\'d be less swollen if she kept them elevated. They didn\'t get better, and she now takes bumdetanide. This link is to her blood work: http://pasteboard.co/Rgcehx7dE.png\n\nIt is a set of simple graphs showing the results of blood tests since 2012, in blue, and the results on Day 1 and Day 3 at the hospital.\n\nThis is a link to the heart test done on the day she was discharged, Day 3. http://pasteboard.co/5koufiyZ6.png\n\nIt also shows the list of drugs that might have been used in the hospital. Labetalol was definitely used at least once in the middle of the second night in the hospital. I don\'t know anything about the warfarin\n\n*The Aricept started last fall. I wish she were not on it.\n**The Gabapentin started recently, and was prescribed for very pain muscle cramps in her right hand. I wish she were not on it. When not cramping up, her hand feels both numb and tingly. That started  two weeks after she was prescribed the bumetanide. Apparently it\'s very a common side effect.'"

So, I really appreciate any thoughts on the following.  I have received really great care thus far - especially in the ER last night but wouldn\'t feel right if I didn\'t try to access the resources I have access to before my upcoming appointment.  Thank you so very much in advance!\n\nFebruary ended up in hospital with puke/poops and dehydration which was written as gastroenteritis... ended up having some anti-nausea and was give some fluids - felt amazing after the fluid.  Few days later had broken a tooth, had to go to dentist bc it was a previous root canal - was given Amoxicillin 500mg 3x / day - took with no issues.  This is important for later.  Never had issues with anti-biotics, no known allergies, no known drug allergies.\n\nLeading up to this I was experiencing extreme thirst, so much thirst, was drinking a lot of water.  I\'ve always had issues with my sugar consumption, esp in relation to juice.  In early March I had blood work ordered because I was worried about blood sugars and possible diabetes.  Blood work ordered - I didn\'t do the blood work promptly.\n\nEnd of March 2023 - travelled to UK, was ill upon arrival - presented with strep like symptoms, spots on tonsils, fever, chills, unable to control body temp., extreme night sweats, body aches, etc. - this resolved in 2 or so days, sinus stuffiness throughout the trip...  During the trip I didn\'t have much appetite and tend to not when travelling - also didn\'t enjoy the traditional family foods - lost about 20 pounds over a week... granted there was A LOT of walking, some days upward of 17KMs, trip to London, etc.  I tried to keep up as best I could but was definitely not able to as I would have normally.\n\nAlso then ended up getting sick on the way home.. which I attributed to the long dry flight... my throat was sore and raw, started smoking again when I got back so thought that likely had something to do with it but was also night sweating, congested, etc.\n\nOnce I arrived home a there was one day my husband went to bear-hug me and hugged me very tightly and unexpectedly and cracked my upper back - between shoulder blades - it took my breath away and i hugged him because I didn\'t want my legs to give out underneath me.  After this I noticed my feet were very tingly and numb in places.  At first it kind of migrated from the bottoms and tops but then it just kind of settled in a persisted for about 2 to 3 weeks.  This along with the previous concerns around blood sugar and diabetes prompted me to do the blood work and urine.\n\n\\- Random glucose was 5.6\n\n= Hemo A1C was 5.3\n\nApril 14 blood work came back pretty normal aside from very slight abnormalities - things that flagged:\n\n\\- MCH LO @ 27.4\n\n\\- Platelet HI @ 408\n\nUrine came back with:\n\n\\- Blood (prob bc I was starting my period)\n\n\\- Positive for enterococcus species\n\n\\- Postive for group B strep\n\nI have been prone to UTIs and have had an ongoing pain in my power left stomach for 2 or so years - they flare up, have had kidney stones, etc.  So, thought it was exactly that - another UTI.  I end up having so much pelvic pain for so long that it becomes normal and then get on anti-biotics, the inflammation and swelling goes down, the bloat goes down, and my pelvis, and back feel a ton better -  this has occurred before.\n\nApril 16 I started Amoxicillin 500mg 3X / day.  1.5 days in my legs started to present hives - obviously looked it up and saw the relation between ammox and hives.  Let it be over the weekend and then went back to the clinic the following Monday.  I will include photos.\n\nApril 25 I was give Macrobid for 5 days (don\'t recall #), Bilaxten, and Betamethasone cream - proceeded with this.\n\nProceeded as normal.  UTI seems to have resolved - feeling a lot better in that way.  Trying to stay hydrated.  The ""hives"" that presented with the Amox had persisted - each evening they would get itchy and I would scratch, they would bruise.  I had bruises all over my lower body, ""hives "" all over lower body - butt and legs - and then own sores where I had scratched.  The ""hives"" were presenting in two ways, little small raised pin point red spots and then larger blotchy raised what looked like welts - all would bruise.  Joints have also flared up and have brusies and welts, very sore to bend and move - swollen.  I will include a photo.\n\nLast week around May 4-5 the welts continued to persist, kind of ""flaring"" up in the evenings - I was taking an OTC allergen that was not really helping so I stopped.  Continued to use to cream that was also not really helping.  Showering would hurt them, hot water would hurt.\n\nMay 8 my feet started swelling, my joints were very sore, the welts that I had scratched were bruised and my left ankle was extremely swollen and stiff.  The swelling started to spread toward my feet and toes.\n\nI called a telehealth service, described symptoms and details - was advised to go to hospital.  I wanted to wait until today AM to go to the clinic but the nurse was adamant - so we went at 9:30PM.\n\nWent into ER, vitals stable and normal.  Was admitted to ER.  Older ER doc took a look and was pretty shocked, brought another guy in... said it was purpura and was not blanching.  Will include photos.  He said that I was too old for Henoch-Schnlein despite it being all over my lower body, etc.  Said it could be Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura.  Ordered blood work and urine.\n\nHad blood work done - didn\'t see it but was told nothing abnormal.  No comments on urine.\n\nThey ended up taking more blood, prescribing me with a heavy step down plan of prednisone to help combat (what I understand) is my immune response... causing petechia under my skin.  They settled on what they think is vasculitis... took a punch skin biopsy... referred me to internal medicine... and sent me home.  Provided prednisone before I went home.  Felt like what I thought was some relief within minutes but idk if it was psychosomatic and I was desperate lol.\n\nAnyway... day 1 of pred. step down plan... waiting for IM appointment on May 26... and living with these... legs.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/kXLmVz6](https://imgur.com/a/kXLmVz6)'"

In January 2023, she started saying that her neighbors are harassing her and she didnt sleep at night.

Initially the reaction was severe and I was diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis which took several weeks to clear up. The reaction came in the form of increased Eczema activity all over my body (not too as massive a degree as described later, but considered a typical breakout) and extreme irritation to my eyes. Follow up visits to the same woman that occurred every 3 weeks resulted in extremely massive eczema outbreaks, resulting in symptoms such as extreme outbreaks and redness across my entire body (including the majority of surface area on my back, typical outbreak areas such as neck and crooks of limbs, and across hands and arms).\n\nSymptoms included typical redness and irritated skin, but unlike typical eczema outbreaks, these explosive reactions also included oozing from back and beard as well as from areas that showed the worst symptoms of the outbreak. These symptoms would start within 12 hours of the visit and would maintain severity for the duration of the visit. They would start to calm down over 3 days after the visit had ended and general healthiness of skin took many weeks to return to a nominal state with typical eczema symptoms. Over these 6 months, my SO and I have taken steps to eliminate potential exposure vectors (detergent, soaps, lotion, perfumes, makeup, environment, location of being with each other, whether we have intimacy of any kind, etc.) A visit to an allergist indicated that it would likely be a combination of factors that led to this level of reactivity, and that it was unlikely to be a factor derived directly from the person themselves.\n\nWe worked to remove any of these factors as possibilities by having her bathe and stop usage of the various products she typically uses as well as by swapping to products and detergents that I have used for a quite a while without issue. Additionally, stress was indicated to be a potential factor. This person has quite literally caused zero stress in my life, and has been one of the most positive and supportive people I have ever had the pleasure of dating, and my stress with her is generally significantly less when I spend time or interact with her. Additionally, we interact virtually as well as in person, and this reaction happens after only close exposure, which to me eliminates stress from her as a likely source. The only thing that is common between all our interactions after eliminating all these potential sources is simply being around or near her for more than a few hours. I have been told multiple times that there is virtually no chance that this by itself can be the issue. I have never smoked or done drugs, and I don't drink more than once a month in a casual setting. I have had Eczema since the age of 12, but have never had reactivity even close to this in my entire life, and I any of my typical sources I still get outbreaks from don't cause reactions any more heavily than they normally do.\n\nCan anyone provide any advice or potential experience with having heard of such a situation?\n\nTL;DR: Experiencing massive eczema outbreaks when interacting with S.O. Eliminated all possible vectors we could think of or have been advised to, leaving just her existence in interaction as the source."""

In early March, neurology decided I also have fibromyalgia and advised 500mg magnesium glycinate daily for body aches. I\'m super sensitive to drugs & chemicals so I took just 100mg that night with my evening meal. Two hours later I experienced severe gut cramping followed by four or five bouts of explosive diarrhea. No vomiting, no fever, no headache. I blamed the magnesium.\n\nThree weeks later I again had the severe gut cramping and explosive diarrhea, except this time I had not taken any magnesium. Two nights later it happened again. So painful I was crying. (I gave birth to twins with no drugs so I\'m not a wuss.)  I went to the ER where everything was ""unremarkable"": blood and urine labs, EKG, and CT w/contrast (oddly, my left eye puffed up a bit, perhaps a reaction to the contrast.) Lipase was low-ish at 28. (A second lipase from a week ago was 20.)\n\nI have been in constant pain in the six weeks since then. It took about a week for my bowels to return to (mostly) normal and I no longer have lower abdominal pain but I continue to have dull/cramping pain and pressure under my sternum and along the bottom edge of my left ribs, with occasional icepick stabbing pains. No reflux or GERD. I am eating half of my normal portions because I get uncomfortably full very quickly. Eating doesn\'t make the pain better or worse, it\'s just always there 24/7. It feels like there is a hand squeezing under my sternum. Breathing in and lifting my ribcage up gives me some relief.\n\nI\'ve seen my PCP and a GI doc who are both telling me it must be IBS, functional dyspepsia, or (my all-time favorite) anxiety. They\'ve run absolutely no tests because ""the CT in the ER was clean."" I\'m thinking it\'s my pancreas as my mother, great grandmother and great-uncle all died of PC and I myself have had bouts of unexplained pain (same place, sternum and left ribs) nine or ten times over the past 13 years. Each of those bouts lasted about a month and then resolved (with no answers.) In 2019 I had a 72-hour fecal fat test come back flagged high but that\'s the only ""proof"" I have of pancreatic issues.\n\nBefore I took that 100mg of magnesium way back on March 5th I had been fine. I\'m pretty sure I didn\'t suddenly develop IBS, functional dyspepsia or anxiety out of the blue (LoL) so I think the Mg triggered something or perhaps the violent episodes of diarrhea caused some kind of damage? Since then I\'ve been taking daily probiotics, peppermint oil, and 300mg of gabapentin (which I\'ve taken for years for hot flashes) but nothing is helping me feel better. I\'m exhausted after two months of non-stop pain.\n\nI would love to hear y\'all\'s thoughts.  Cheers!'"

My heart rate will routinely get as low as higher 40s low 50s while at rest, and even as low as 42 while sleeping (my dad and sister have the same thing). My ecg has always shown normal. Basically, I know you guys can't really give medical advice here, but if there's anything you think could put my mind at ease, or that I should be concerned about, I'd really appreciate it.

For additional info, I\'m roughly 137lb, 5\'3"", caucasian, and currently take sertraline (100mg), testosterone, and a rescue inhaler.

They also appear on my elbow, and very occasionally my knees, but the knees are very rare. They don\'t itch at all, but are pretty painful.

If you\'d like to take a gander, I have a few photos linked HERE: [https://imgur.com/a/2HSpt33](https://imgur.com/a/2HSpt33) . She suggested I see a rheumatologist rather promptly, but the clinics in my area require a referral with a more extensive history than I currently have, which is partially why I\'m seeking a second opinion before calling my primary care doctor, especially as I\'m waiting for my new insurance policy to start. Additionally, my hands are not broken out at the moment, as I was able to get an appointment only after it had run its course. These rashes used to occur maybe once a year, but now happen every few months. They last for a few weeks, but typically leave a small bump or two behind that ends up blending almost perfectly into my skin.\n\nMisc. Hand Ailments: I have a few issues that occur in my hands (in addition to the rashes). I have raynaud\'s, and my the skin of my palms are pretty mottled. The raynaud\'s I\'ve had for as long as I can remember, and the mottling I unfortunately don\'t remember, but the first time I noticed it is when my sister commented that my hands resembled colby jack cheese, which was about six years ago. My finger joints often swell as well, especially after periods of activity. I\'m also unable to do push-ups due to inflexibility of my wrists, but I have no clue if that\'s related.\n\nKnee pain: I suffer from knee pain, but honestly didn\'t think much of it. I was always a short kid, so any time I\'ve had awful knee pain, I\'ve always brushed it off as growing pains. Pain usually occurs when I have my legs extended, in the mornings, or when the weather is cold. This knee pain has happened for a few years now.\n\nPoor blood flow: My blood flow is pretty poor, and has been for multiple years. My hands tingle pretty often, and standing for long periods of time leads to blood pooling at my feet, and of course tingling there. I also generally bruise pretty easily, and when I worked as a cashier, I developed varicose veins. \n\nMisc symptoms: I did the one thing you shouldn\'t do, and that was google ""arthritis symptoms."" Any symptoms that seemed a little far-fetched or unrelated, I\'ve listed here: tinnitus, chronic swelling of throat (tonsils have always been very large), redness of eyes, shortness of breath, chronic fatigue, lymph node swelling, and loss of appetite. All of these symptoms have presented for a few years now, but have just become a part of my daily life. \n\nI appreciate the feedback! If you have any questions, feel free to comment or message me. I also will be seeking a second opinion, this post is more to give me the idea of how pressing the matter is, any other possible options.'"

Typically I would get hives on my skin, sometimes an itchy mouth, but nothing too severe. Over the past two years, my reactions have skyrocketed.\n\nRandom things will give me hives and welts on my skin, im sensitive to many topical creams (my skin bled after using ketoconazole for suspected seborrheic dermatitis), and on Christmas eve of last year I went into anaphylaxis with angioedema on my face and body from an unknown trigger and wound up in the ER. Since then, I was prescribed Epipens in case of anaphylaxis, but I havent reached that point of severity again.\n\nWithin the past 3-4 months, my eyes have begun to swell and I have recurring angioedema of my eyes and mouth. I was put on hydroxyzine and monteloukast as well as a baby dose of Zyrtec, on top of my occasional benedryl. I am intolerant to most other allergy medications (allegra, claratin, etc) and they give me an intense stimulant effect and tachycardia.\n\nWith the eye swelling comes hardened and sore skin, which is why a doctor suspected Seb.Derm, though I dont have many of the other hallmark symptoms.\n\nMy eyes are swelling to the point where they are hard to close/blink, and feel as though the skin around my eyes and eyelids is sunburnt or raw. Typically these flare ups will last for a day or two, then my skin will calm down and be okay for a few weeks. I have been using vanicream facewash and moisturizer, as well as Aquaphor for the very dry spots of my skin.\n\nDuring this current flare up, my eyes have been even more swollen than usual, giving a red and bruised appearance all around. I work as a therapist, and this is incredibly embarrassing meeting with clients while looking like this.\n\nIve tried ice as warm compresses on top of the medications, but am not finding any relief. Ive been to a dermatologist, an allergist, and my primary. All think different things (seb.derm, allergies to my pets, pollen allergies) but really have admitted they have no clue.\n\nI do have pets (cats, dogs, small animals) but have grown up with animals my entire life and have only had mild cat allergies that cause sniffles or runny nose, but my cats dont cause any reactions  only new cats if I visit someones home. This also doesnt feel like a typical allergic reaction to pets, this is much more painful and chronic.\n\nAny ideas of where to go from here?\n\nI will include photos of when I went into anaphylaxis last year, as well as photos of the eye swelling.

I have a question regarding a recurring eye issue that my younger brother (M, 18) has been experiencing. His complications began when he was around 3 or 4 years old, characterized by red, watery eyes. Ophthalmologists initially believed that his symptoms were due to an allergic reaction to something in the environment, and they expected the issue to resolve as he grew older. \n\nHowever, a few years ago, he was diagnosed with corneal ulcers in both eyes, which was a distressing ordeal for our entire family. Thankfully, he made a full recovery. Recently, he has been experiencing irritation, swelling, and blurry vision in his left eye, along with a milky-looking discoloration.\n\nWe reside in a rural area of Zambia, where booking an appointment with an ophthalmologist can be challenging and usually involves a lengthy waiting list. While we await an appointment, I was hoping to gather any insights or advice from this community regarding my brother's condition. Any suggestions or recommendations are greatly appreciated.

November 22 I developed an itchy rash on the back of my neck which soon spread to my shoulders, back and eventually my face/ears/scalp. I work in TRAUMA/ER and the only thing I could think of was a recent exposure to a homeless woman that we believed to have scabies and some sort of visible lice or bugs all over her. Unfortunately, she did not survive so follow up at the onset of my symptoms was not available. I was treated for scabies with permethrin x 3 as well as lice shampoo. Symptoms temporarily subsided and then returned in the same spots and other places. 20 years in the hospital and prehospital setting I had never experienced anyhting of this nature, I was so freaked out that I bought a new bed,new bedding, rugs and drapes. I steamed and deconned other furniture, had air ducts cleaned,bombed my house and car multiple times, washed and bagged every item possible, you name it ....I did it, did a second round of topical permethrin x 2, sulfa baths etc. Things mellowed out leaving areas that resembled mosquito like bites with dark spots in the middle that would come back after a week or so plus new ones. I went to derm and they acted like I was crazy, standing so far away from me I don\'t know how she was able to evaluate eventually telling me contact dermatitis. Offering triamcinalone, keflex and benedryl. I started crying and she eventually said ""fine, Ill give you ivermectin and that will be like an atomic bomb!"" She prescribed one time dose and sent me on my way, they never discussed or called me for follow up lol. After ivermectin things got worse, flaking and bareley improving. I was done with derm and employee health at this point. My PMD did telemed apt and told me to stop steroid, start doxy, permethrin again and 6 more doses of ivermectin.

Since my teens I suffer from asthma, though, thankfully, it is mostly in remission. I have a reaction to dust and some other things, including, apparently, to cold temperature that causes bronchospasm. \n\nBut few months ago I have started experiencing a new phenomenon: after having a cold with an incredibly strong cough -- so I even damaged by vocal chords that required months to heal -- I am now not only can experience bronchospasm if I breath in cold air or if I lay to sleep on a cold bed, but I also immediately start to have a dry cough.\n\nIt is very annoying since the ""low"" temperature that triggers this reaction is actually not low at all -- about 27 (!) Celsius or something (this is probably due to vegetative-vascular dystonia that causes poor termoregulation). This makes me almost unable to have a job with people around me as I would annoy everyone to death, let alone harming my vocal chords all over again UNLESS I will put on absurdly warm clothes or few layers of them.\n\nFrom what I was able to gather from reading the Internet, the main recommendation is just to avoid the circumstances that trigger the effect. And, indeed, all is fine when I work from home where I can be as warm as I can in terms of clothes and/or regulate temperature of my room to my liking. However, this is obviously not possible when I have to work from office.\n\nSure, there is probably a way to deal with this by constantly, FOREVER taking strong anti-chough drugs -- medium doses do not help me since the irritation of the upper lungs and, hence, the cough reaction is strong -- but is unhealthy.\n\nI wonder if there is a therapy to stop this reaction altogether, to reverse things back to half a year ago when my only effect from cold was bronchospasm that is at least silent and does not harm my vocal chords. \n\nThanks in advance.'"

I was rear-ended mid-January. This is my 10th car accident, able to walk away from all of them. Multiple concussions through accidents and sports. Hypothyroidism controlled with medication. Currently struggling with histamine over-reaction that is not controlled despite taking four different anti-histamines. Allergy doc has been consulted and doesnt believe this is having an effect on current condition. Asthma currently controlled with Advair.  No smoking, no recreational drugs, and occasional drinking (absolutely no drinking on current meds). \n\nMeds - Levothyroxin 50 mcg 8x/wk, Allegra otc 2 2x/day, Pepcid otc 2 2x/day, Claritin otc 1/day, Hydroxyxine 10 mg 1/day at bedtime, Gabapentin 300 mg 3x/day, Meloxicam 7.5 mg 1/day, Advair 115-21 mcg 2x/day \n\nCurrent - We were rear ended at a stoplight.  Other driver was going maybe 40+ mph - hit the accelerator instead of the brake. My pain was really well controlled with physical therapy and massage for the first month after the accident. The right side of my face has been numb since the accident. I wasnt worried because I had ice-pick headaches after the last accident (also rear-ended at a red light) that came with right facial numbness and shock-like pain. Unfortunately, in the last couple weeks my numbness has been increasing and now experiencing intermittent pain and burning along with the numbness. This past week I woke up to my neck, armpit, breast, arm, hand, last two fingers, hip, and outer thigh numb - all right side like my face. Numb as in decreased sensation.  I can tell something is touching me, but couldnt tell you what without looking. The vision in my right eye is affected - lots of pressure and I can tell its working much harder than usual to focus which is making my headaches worse. At the same time the pain in my hands had increased until they became almost unusable. They were painful to open, painful to close, and werent able to hold things reliably. Also couldnt lift them above my elbows without terrible pain.  I reached out to my healthcare team. My GP prescribed the meloxicam and told me to continue therapy. My neuro told me to cancel all therapy and get and MR and MRA of the brain, cervical spine and neck to check for brain or spinal cord injury. Thats scheduled for 6 weeks from now. He also prescribed gabapentin to help with the numbness. My pain has come crashing back without therapy. The gabapentin is controlling most of my pain, including my headaches and severe hand pain, though its very hard to function on it - havent driven since starting it. The meloxicam is controlling the muscle pain in my neck and low back, but I am absolutely having psychological side effects - no filter and no patience to put it mildly.  I have a customer-facing job so this is going to be difficult.   \n\n\nDespite no longer going to therapy as instructed, the numbness is continuing to get worse. Starting this morning, my right lower leg and foot are numb. Also strange that I can now feel the numbness despite being on the gabapentin (when I first started taking it, the numbness went away).  I dont have any drooping or loss of motor function (outside of the expected from the gabapentin - just a little wobbly). Im also having new circulation issues in my feet and hands, I usually never run cold. My left hand is consistently colder than my right and my feet are ice cubes.   \n\n\nQuestion - Were the neurologists instructions out of an abundance of caution or are there other activities I should be avoiding to prevent whatever is going on from getting worse? Currently no heavy or high impact activities, just hiking 2 miles in the morning with our dogs - critical for my mental health which is rapidly deteriorating. But strange that I cant get a massage, but no lifting, stretching or exercise restrictions. In your experience, does this generally come to nothing or is this going to continue to get worse until I do experience motor deficits. Just really getting scared and anxiety never helps anything. Already planning on reaching out to my neuro on Monday but hoping for some comfort over the weekend. Never experienced anything like this.   \n\n\nThank you in advance for your time. It is really appreciated.'"

I went to the doctor, and she used the stethoscope, made some other really basic tests and found nothing. So, her first reaction was to tell me it was just anxiety -- even though I go to the therapist and we both agree I am in perfect mental condition with no worries besides being worried for my heart\'s health -- and ask how did I know I had blood in my throat if I never saw it. And I was like ""WTF?! I know the taste of my own blood! Why is sight a good criterion but other senses like taste are to be ignored?""\n\nMonths later, and after basically fighting a war against everyone in my healthcare service, they finally found evidence that I indeed have something: a slight offset in my EKG. They explained that the last line of the EKG was offset by 6 little squares when the maximum is 5. So now they will be start doing more tests. Finally!\n\nBut this is not the first time this happens to me: I have a neurological complex condition from childhood that started with daily tantrums so big that they ended with me fainting. I\'m no doctor, but fainting after a tantrum doesn\'t seem just a psychological condition to me. However, docs said I was just a spoiled child and were constantly threatening my mum with sending social services for me. After several years of constant pushing, my mum finally got them to actually send me to tests and found that I have an arachnoid cyst pushing the temporal lobe and a hypoactive frontal lobe, and they had an opportunity to scan me while being in a ""tantrum"" and found out that they were actually hour long seizures. They started medication and my seizures weakened to the point where I only have one every \\~four years. Afterwards, occasionally I have had other neurological symptoms (body disobeying my conscious self, traditional epileptic seizures, headaches and migraines, jaw muscles tensing so hard that I think my bones will be crushed by them, etc.) and every single time I -- or previously my mum-- have had to fight to prove the doctors that we were not just being paranoid. It\'s exhausting. And I experienced this with many doctors in many institutions.\n\nBut after talking with other people with disabilities and chronic illnesses, I\'ve heard that same story over and over again: Getting a diagnostic is a war against doctors. And it does not seem to matter what institution it is or who the patient is: Britain, US, Mexico, private sector, public sector, women, men, healthy looking, sick looking, John Doe, Celine Dion, everyone has that same horror story.\n\nSo, I cannot stop wondering: Why? I don\'t want to be judgemental -- even if it is really hard from my side -- Is it something about your training? I know everyone seems to think they know about medicine  because of Daddy Google and Aunt Karen Essential-Oils and you have to be skeptical of evidence, and I heard that tests have the risk of creating false positives and one should not test just because, but from my side, there should be easy solutions that don\'t involve the need for your patients to wage war against you 24/7 just to get diagnosed. Or is it so common for people to be paranoid and/or hypochondriac that we people who actually have something are being self-selected within patients\' groups so that we are not seeing the other side? What is happening?!\n\nAnd, finally, some tips that would help actually informed patients to get you to know that we are actually informed and are not being paranoid would be highly appreciated and sorry if this sounded accusatory: I am genuinely trying to understand, but this is exhausting.\n\nP.S. to comply with the rules even though the problem has nothing to do with it: Valproic Acid 200 mg, Citalopram 20 mg.

I took a picture of it and it has patches that look like scabbing. Primarily around the lower portion. \n\nIt is persistently giving me a slight stinging pain and is quite painful to the touch. In the picture I took I noticed portions are just entirely red, as if the skin fell off or peeled and it bled/scabbed. The entire area has a flaky feel to it. \n\nThis goes up the length of the back of the ear, but the worst of it is at the bottom by far, behind the ear lobe.\n\nAdjacent to my ear on my neck (almost where they meet) I have what seems to be a tiny bit of the rash. It\'s similar to what I developed on my chest (see next paragraph).\n\nI also simultaneously had a mild and small rash develop of my upper chest. It\'s in two parts near each other and the entire area is smaller than the size of my palm. It has no bleeding or anything like that. It just seems like a rash. \n\nTo be clear, these both occurred at the same time. \n\nI did a bit of Googling and after being lead about 5 different ways I gave up.\n\nThis is all behind the ear and doesn\'t show in the front at all. \n\nI have never had the ear thing happen before. The only time I\'ve had a rash like this throughout my life was as a reaction to something (like cheap laundry detergent).\n\nI have re-cleaned all my bed stuff thoroughly as well as my clothes and I have noticed the rash is gradually getting smaller and less dark red.

It\'s hard to tell. \n\nJust weighing my options before I go see a doctor about it on my next day off if it doesn\'t improve soon. \n\nThanks in advance!'"

For context, I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. I have been on 11 different psychiatric medications over the coarse of 6 years. These are: Prozac, Zoloft, Cymbalta, Abilify, Lithium, Trileptal, Buspar, Trintellix, lexapro, Viibryd, and lamictal. I am currently still taking Viibryd. Lamictal is the only medication that has ever helped me with my depression and suicidal ideations. I took this drug 2 years ago but had to stop once I reached 75 mg due to a skin reaction. My NP told me it was not Steven Johnsons syndrome, but told me I had to stop taking it. 2 weeks ago, I asked if I could try taking lamictal again. She agreed and I have been taking 25mg for the last 10 days. Yesterday, I noticed what seemed to be hives on my hands/wrist and above my knee. I am not able to reach my NP because the clinic is closed and she wont get an email until Monday or Tuesday. Because I know she would tell me to stop taking it, I did not take it today. I am wondering if I go to urgent care tomorrow if a doctor would be able to tell if its a benign rash? This medication is saving my life and if its benign I do not want to stop this medication. Would a doctor be able to tell if its benign by simply looking at my skin, or would a blood test/ patch test need to be conducted? I also have Eczema so I am not sure if it has to do with this.'"

I know that functional/integrative medicine is generally dismissed by the  scientific medical community, but I\'m wondering if there is ANY merit at all  (e.g., even speculative) to what she is getting on about. Looking for not just completely dismissive comments, though- if you do want to dismiss completely, please help me to understand why or point me to something I can read to understand why(for my sake!).\n\nSome  background: I\'ve had depression/anxiety issues since I was a teenager  (now in my late 30s). Lifestyle changes help, but minimally. Psychiatric Meds (mainly  SSRIs, and viibryd in particular) DO in fact help me quite a bit, but they cause some nasty side effects  (mainly GI-related, e.g., daily diarhea) that can be difficult to manage and concern me about my overall health in the long-term. So I decided to try working with this functional  nutritionist as an experiment. I have NO scientific  background, so I have no way to evaluate what she\'s saying. This puts me in a vulnerable position, of course. I\'m a bit a the mercy of this nutritionist since she is the one with a masters in dietetics . I\'ve taken  the position that this is just an experimental treatment, and as long as  it doesn\'t cause harm to me than there\'s no real loss (besides $$) if it\'s  pointless. I will back out if it turns out to not give me noticeable benefits.\n\nOn to what she\'s told me:\n\nWe did a ""GI-map"" stool test (me pooping into a carton and sending it off to lab) and the results show a high  levels of pseudomonas overgrowth. She says that this is a big issue. Here is a picture of the relevant part of the test: [https://imgur.com/clIMaH6](https://imgur.com/clIMaH6) . She sees this bacterial overgrowth  as potentially the cause of some my mood struggles, and says that she has seen many  others improve vastly after eliminating this. We are  attempting to eradicate the pseudomonas through an elimination diet and some supplements (which I can list, if anyone wants to know). She has me both gluten-free and dairy-free for reasons  that I don\'t quite understand , but that may be related to the high  secretory IGA and anti-gliadin IGA result (I have no idea what that is...) shown in the image (link, again, here: [https://imgur.com/clIMaH6](https://imgur.com/clIMaH6))  I am a month into this treatment and I see no  benefits as of yet... I have never had anything like allergic reactions to gluten or dairy, but I do experience some bloating, I suppose, after eating them (nothing painful though). \n\nI have a medical doc in the family who says that the presence of pseudomonas in the gut would be expected in just about anybody and probably isn\'t much concern.\n\nAny comments or insight would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR: I would like to know how likely it is that I have developed a penicillin/drug allergy? I also suspect I have strep right now, but can not go to the doctor for a few more days. Wondering what I should do to mitigate symptoms/if I should take the antibiotics that I have at home from a previous medical incident. More details below. \n\n\nI am a 21 year old female. \n\nWhen I was around 19 years old I had a weird incident where one side of my face swelled up badly, my mouth hurt, and I was feeling generally ill/feverish. Doctors had a hard time identifying where the infection started and why, but I stayed at the hospital for 1-2 days and was prescribed antibiotics to deal with it after. I was instructed to take amoxicillin somewhere around a month (this seemed odd since I had never been on them that long whenever u needed them before).  Ive always been instructed to take all prescribed antibiotics to prevent bacteria resistance, but ended up having an allergic reaction (hives) after about 2.5 weeks on into taking the antibiotics. Im wondering how likely it is that I would have developed a long term penicillin allergy from this? Ive never had issues with any other drugs and Im not sure if this is just be a reaction from being on them too long or something I should be concerned about? \n\n\nIm also suspecting that I have strep right now. I never had strep throat until high school, but ended up getting it dozens of times in the few years before my tonsillectomy at 17. I have not had strep (or any memorable sore throats) since Ive had my tonsils removed, but am experiencing that familiarly awful feeling of razor blades in my throat while swallowing right now. I am a college student at a large university and heard its been going around. Unfortunately, I can not go to the doctor until Monday afternoon/Tuesday. The campus clinic is closed on the weekend and I do not have the ability or finances to go to another hospital or urgent care right now. I have a midterm Monday morning that I can not miss class for an appointment, but am worried about it escalating. I have 14 amox/clav 500/125mg tablets leftover and am not sure if it would be a good idea to take them?  Any other recommendations would be appreciated!\n\nEdit: The last time I have taken antibiotics was in 2020 when I had the incident explained below. \n\nI have been taking OTC medicine (dayquil/ibuprofen/Tylenol) for the sore throat I have now. Its been helping, but I still have notable throat pain.'"

A tiredness that the term ""fatigue"" gives a good idea of, to indicate the fact that it is a completely pathological, abnormal asthenia. It\'s not just physical fatigue, so I can\'t even go for a walk when I\'m sick, or when I\'m less sick I can go around the neighborhood at most and then I\'m forced to go home.\n\nIf I NEED to do something because I absolutely have to, with adrenaline and noradrenaline I still can get over the fatigue, but of course this doesnt work long term.\n\n* 2 Inability of the body to regulate body temperature, which makes me resist cold and heat worse, especially cold.\n* 3 ""Brain fog"" / mental fog, in which I find it much more difficult to think and do anything that requires a psychic commitment. When I feel really bad even listening to a simple Youtube video becomes difficult, IMAGINE how impossible it is to focus on more difficult tasks if food makes me ALWAYS feel bad.\n* 4 Pain in the abdomen when pressing in the area below the navel, which indicates that it is something related to the gastrointestinal system.\n* 5 Feeling of fullness and a little burning in the intestines, as if something is not working properly. But Ive never had diarrhea, vomit, or hemorrhoids.\n* 6 Weight loss, in 2 years I lost 12kg from 72kg, now luckily I have stabilized at 60kg, but I have lost a lot of mass, and not only fat mass but also muscle mass as indicated by the impedance scale I bought.\n* 7 My body\'s constant need to rest and recuperate, as if recovering from an ""abnormal""/inflammatory/autoimmune reaction.\n* 8 Increased probability of getting sick, and in fact I have had a fever 3 times this winter without having caught Covid (negative to the home covid test). I sometimes get a fever or a slight alteration at times of the year like summer, without even having come into contact with organic sources.\n* 9 Constant feeling of being unwell, similar to having a fever caused by the flu, like a dull ache.\n* 10 Tendency of circadian rhythm to shift forward 15-20 minutes each day, of unspecified nature, controlled by taking melatonin 3-4 hours before desired bedtime. In these 2 years my circadian rhythm has gone all around the clock 8/9 times for some reason, despite how hard I tried to keep it stable\n* 11 Generalized headache all around the head, as if it came from no precise point at all.\n\n**If I dont eat, after 12/15 hours, but even after 8 hours sometimes, I feel progressively better, even when fasting for 24+ hours.**\n\nSo, as you can see, there is a direct causality with the ingestion of food, and If I dont eat I feel better.\n\nEating any food makes me feel bad, but some make me feel much worse, and for longer.\n\nSolid or fat food tends to make me worse or feel much worse, especially meat, mayonnaise, eggs, even if eaten in little quantities like 2 pieces of bread with mayonnaise inside and nothing else.\n\nMy feces seem completely normal, and considering I feel bad immediately 15/20 minutes after eating, maybe its something that doesnt involve the colon/big intestine.\n\n**Its not something involving any food in particular, nor do I have the symptoms, so its not an allergy, intolerance, or food sensitivity.**\n\nI tested negative on the intestinal permeability test, so likely its not about particular pathogens getting into the bloodstream.\n\nEating sugary food, especially fruits like grapes or apricots, but especially sugar by itself, almost doesnt make me feel bad, so perhaps this indicates something.\n\nFasting makes me feel so good, and I get back so many energies, and its as if I dont feel sick anymore.\n\nConsidering the important clues I wrote below, and that it lasts way after the digestion time, and that the 2 types of food enzymes I took with food did nothing, perhaps its something that doesnt involve the stomach digestion, but the small intestine, pancreas and liver.\n\nWhats clear is that something triggers a body reaction, where a lot of energies get wasted, leaving my immune defenses more attackable.\n\nMy doctor, who is very prepared, says I might not have an enzyme, or have a problem with the incretins\n\nI still have to do the pancolonoscopy and an enteroscopy that checks the entire digestive system up to the ileum with biopsy, which I will hopefully do soon.\n\n**IMPORTANT CLUES:**\n\n1. Eating chewing gums with sweeteners (not sugar), popsicles, Massigen ready recovery and even a capsule of all vitamins with other minerals like magnesium, iron, etc; with nothing else, broken into pieces to drink it without swallowing makes me feel bad, even if for much less time, and much less bad.

On day 8 or 9, both of us started having a bad reaction. I think my mom said we broke out in hives, and then the next day my eyes and lips got puffy, and my little brother got puffy & swollen all over. She was advised to stop the antibiotics and after that we believed we were allergic to it. \n\nFast forward to over 20 years later. My kids are currently both on amoxicillin liquid form. To my knowledge I have not had any form of penicillin since. I have, however, developed bad OCD much of which is contamination related. One of my worries is about developing an allergy and having an anaphylactic reaction. Since both kids are currently on amoxicillin and I have a history of reaction to that drug family, Im so worried that Ill somehow ingest some and have a bad allergic reaction. Im careful when I give them their doses, so its not so much the worry of accidentally ingesting some during then. Its more so after theyve already had their doses. Like if they put their hands in their mouths and then touch something. Then I touch that surface and then later eat something after having touched it. Things like that. Or also changing diapers, is the medicine in their urine. Etc!\n\n Tell me Im being paranoid! I feel crazy lol'"

I have an allergy to Penicillin but nothing else (until now). They prescribed a 10 day course, twice a day. I was fine on the first two days- some nausea and lack of appetite, and some restlessness that caused a bit of sleep disruption (I do have trouble sleeping normally and I take anxiety medication to help with that, but was told not to take it while taking Bactrim) but manageable. By day 3 I was horribly nauseous, could barely keep saltines down. By bedtime I was vomiting, had chills and muscle tremors, and the insomnia was REAL. I think I slept a total of one hour. I was up starting at 2am and did not sleep. The chills and muscle tremors kept me up. My legs were uncontrollably shaking. I did not take my morning dose and ended up seeing my regular doctor for an emergency visit, and they told me my wound was healing nicely and I should definitely stop taking the antibiotics. \n\nI ended up calling the urgent care back and asked them the results of my culture which were benign, no staph just bacteria. I asked if that reaction was normal and they said the nausea was, but not anything else. Would this be considered an allergy?

I had a severe reaction to the IV Dilaudid they did not tell me they were giving me.',"b'I went to the ER for a kidney infection. I described my pain as a dull ache, and asked for ibuprofen since I hadnt taken any yet that day. They agreed that the plan of action was to give me pain meds, stronger antibiotics than urgent care initially gave, IV fluids, and Zofran for nausea. They started the IV meds and I was hit with instant adrenaline shock, euphoria, throat closed as I gasped for air, feeling like I was blacking out, racing heart, and felt increasing panic with each passing second. I told the nurse, Something is wrong, something is wrong, what IS that, PLEASE stop it and finally (very delayed) she interrupted the infusion and flushed the line with saline. She told me they gave a low dose of IV Dilaudid, because thats what they usually give for flank pain. She joked with me that Im very small (103 lb 51 female). I asked for ibuprofen, not a strong narcotic. She never acknowledged that I had an obvious allergic reaction. I spent the next 3 hours calm and numb, but beside myself coping with being uncomfortably high and panicked. I asked if theyd be willing to give a single dose of an anti-anxiety med like Ativan to help with this, and they declined, because that was not the reason for the visit, and later on I can address this with a psychiatrist and therapist. I was not having a mental breakdown - my body was reacting to the medication they administered. When it came time to discharge me and send me home, I told them how awful I felt and that I was going to throw up. They sent me home crying with a vomit bag. I spent the next 5 hours vomiting at home, and the next 48 hours restless and agitated. I am so upset by this whole experience, the fact that I asked for ibuprofen and instead I was given a strong narcotic without my consent, especially because I had to drive myself home. Another reason is that I used to be a regular drug user and take oxycodone - Im 100% clean from that and would prefer to keep it that way unless I absolutely needed the treatment for severe pain. There was a camera in the ER room. Would it be appropriate and necessary to ask for this footage, if I have a right to obtain that as a patient? Is this story worth telling to someone higher up at the hospital, or do I let it go? The nurse was very kind and I dont want to get her in trouble, but I also want to advocate for myself and make sure that my reaction was properly noted - I was NOT just a lightweight like she implied - I truly believe if I hadnt instructed her to stop the medicine, I wouldve gone into anaphylactic shock or needed Narcan.'"

As the title states, my workplace serves young people and this week's drug test surprised us. We all expected weed, but we also had positives for meth, coke, and opioids. Some individuals tested positive for a combination of these substances, while some had one of of those substances + weed. The proposed treatment plan for these young people is group drug counseling, once per week, and leveraging our relationships with young people to create positive change. We have no specialized training in mental health or substance use and would contract out for group drug counseling.\n\nMy background is in social work, so I'm aware of substance use interventions theoretically, but have never worked with these issues in practice. My gut reaction to these treatment ideas are:\n\n1) We should not determine the treatment plans for these young people as we don't have the experience or training;\n\n2) Even if we feel like we can contract out the right services for these folks, a one-size-fits-all approach is inappropriate given we have poly-substance use and dual diagnoses in the mix;\n\n3) Weekly group counseling sessions and positive relationships with these young people, with no other interventions, will set us all up for failure. These young people are also dealing with social issues like homelessness, justice involvement, poverty, etc. Our mission is to get them a GED and some job training, not address these issues.\n\nI'd really like to speak to management about this asap, if my perspective is valid. Above all, I don't want to harm these young people by trying to serve them in a way that is outside our scope."""

I should also mention that during this manic episode, she had got it into her head that she was destined to become some kind of savior of the world. She was already diagnosed with ADHD at this time and was on an overly high dose of Adderall, which was determined to be one of (but not the only) factors that led to her major manic episode. She has been in and out of the hospital several times in the past year but as of now it\'s been a few months since the last time she was in there.\n\nAt some point last year, she started to lose control with Adderall. She started taking almost twice her prescribed dosage (which she claims was partially due to the Olanzapine making her sleepy) and ran out of Adderall a couple weeks ahead of schedule, and she also went to two providers during this time which she claims was due to confusion, and not because she was just trying to get a higher dose. Either way, as a result of this, she got cut off and multiple doctors have been hesitant to get her back on Adderall as well. She was put on Strattera for a little while, but she didn\'t like it because it made her suicidal and anxious.\n\nFast forward to now, she still has a (more minor) savior complex, which I felt might be due to her Olanzapine needing to be adjusted again, as she\'s gone back and forth on the dosage because a higher dose was making her too tired. And even though she\'s been off Adderall for a while now, she still couldn\'t stop talking about how much she needed it and how she felt useless without it, how she needed it so that she could save the world (she was working on a project that she felt would save the world, but couldn\'t work on it without ADHD treatment). She has become utterly obsessed to the point that I felt like she was an addict, even though it had been months since she used it.\n\nFinally, she did something desperate and stupid because she decided she couldn\'t wait for real ADHD treatment anymore (she has a history of being impulsive) so she decided she wanted to go out and try meth. I begged and cried and told her that she couldn\'t do it because meth is a hard boundary for me and I threatened to break up with her. But despite my pleading, I woke up in the middle of the night to find her gone to buy meth from some random dude from Grindr. I freaked out and forced her to come back with the threat of telling her parents (who own the house we live in) and call the cops... Long story short, she came back home without buying any meth, but she\'d already tried a free sample. Once again, I begged and pleaded and cried for her to stop and she promised me she would. A week later, she admits to me that she was lying through her teeth. She snuck out again to buy meth and has been on it for the past week; she was addicted to it from the first time she tried it. She came clean to me and told me she wants to stop, and I believe her this time. But the problem is, she has a doctor\'s appointment on Friday, and I\'m faced with the dilemma of whether to tell her doctor about this whole fiasco because I DO think she needs addiction counseling. I believe her about needing ADHD treatment, but on the other hand, I feel like her Adderall addiction is what caused her to try meth in the first place, despite all my begging and pleading... perhaps mixed in with some bipolar grandiosity and a sense of invincibility? (She tried to convince me that it ""wasn\'t that bad"" so that may be part of the reasoning.) Point being, I worry that going back on ADHD treatment may in fact be bad for her, because even if she needs help to focus, she also needs to not be a drug addict.\n\nSo basically what I\'m asking is, if/when we decide to tell the doctors about her meth usage, what will happen? Will she be barred from receiving any treatment for ADHD ever again? Will the doctors assume that her ADHD was all just made-up in the first place, just because she also happens to be a drug addict, even though ADHD and drug addiction are linked? She\'s trying to get on disability too, and she\'s worried that being honest about her meth use will get her barred from receiving disability because the doctors might stigmatize her as just a drug addict and not as a disabled person who also has drug addiction.\n\nAny and all advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance.'"

My testosterone levels were 26.6nmol/L and I cannot remember my oestrogen/progesterone levels, but they were within the normal range for cis men, so it wasn\'t that.\n\nThe year continued with periods and my testosterone levels never dropping below 18.7nmol/L.\n\nA year after my periods started I managed to get onto hormone blockers again (this time via the NHS because my family are poor), and it stopped them instantly. A few days before I received the hormone blockers I had a blood test and got the results a few days after the blockers. My testosterone levels had dropped to 8.6nmol/L.\n\nSince my testosterone levels were so low, I doubled the dosage (2 pumps daily - 40.5mg of testosterone). After 4 or so months (a week after my second hormone blocker injection) I had another blood test and my testosterone levels had risen to 9.2nmol/L. (This was a few months ago now.)\n\nI still feel period pain despite not having periods and the pain is definitely in a cycle. I did experience this the previous time I had the hormone blockers. This pain may be made worse because I have hEDS (progesterone isn\'t good for hEDS), but I suspect it may be more than just that as I get this ""tearing"" sensation in my uterus, and it\'s so painful and doesn\'t feel right. \n\nI\'ve had two ultrasounds which is why PCOS has been ruled out. I had one when I was 14 and the other last year at 18. They never found anything and never did any follow ups. \n\nI don\'t want a camera inside me to check for endometriosis because it would cause really bad gender dysphoria. I want a hysterectomy to remove both ovaries so I might get an answer to the endometriosis and if that\'s the case, I hope it will fix the period pain I feel. \n\nI do not use any recreational drugs, I don\'t smoke, drink alcohol, or knowingly consume caffeine.   \nI\'m also a virgin, so no way I am or have been pregnant.   \nI also take testosterone 4-6 hours before my blood tests and put the gel on arms/shoulders so it shouldn\'t be that. \n\nI don\'t know what\'s going on with me, but any ideas so I can look into it and ask my doctor about it would be great because it\'s currently a guessing game and I would like to narrow down the possibilities until I get to the bottom of it. Many thanks.'"

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/11uebhl/sudden_onset_of_burning_pain_with_breathing/,b'Sudden onset of burning pain with breathing',"b'32M\n\nFor the past few weeks Ive started experiencing burning and stinging pain when breathing in normal scents, eg. any allergies, irritants, cleaning products left in bathrooms. It started noticeably but mildly. It has progressed to the point where the air is literally burning on fire and stinging and its like Im breathing acid. Its like my airway is just totally in pain from ordinary daily scents or air! Or like theres a cut or something in my airway thats screaming in pain.\n\nI have been to the ER multiple times. They are saying it is gerd but Pepcid and antacid dont really help much (and its clearly worse around ordinary irritants, not so much spicy food). Symbicort briefly helped but not consistently. I have had a clear chest X-ray, normal echo, ekg abnormal but maybe benign, normal troponin, normal cbc and cmp and other labs, normal abdominal ultrasound, and normal CTA albeit before this started. Vitals always are stable. Waiting on two week heart monitor. Seen a cardiologist and so far so good but still doing some more tests; yet to see a pulmonologist. The ER rules out a heart attack and blood clot and pneumonia then discharges me even though I say my pain is like 9/10 and am almost screaming.\n\nI am getting concerned that this is progressing to the point where I can barely go inside anywhere or smell any scents without burning pain in my throat, nose, and chest. It regularly feels like Im breathing in ammonia or fire or acid and its stinging my throat, nose, or chest with each breath.\n\nLast time I was at the doctor the exam room literally burned my throat and chest (I imagine from cleaning products) when it never has historically. The doctor acted like I was crazy when I mentioned it and suggested a pulmonologist and Tylenol.\n\nAny ideas on what would cause this or what to do? The things that come to mind at this point are atypical asthma (they never hear wheezing and oxygen is like 99 but Symbicort helped me quickly in some cases), neurological or nerve damage, an airway injury from chemical burns or something (though I was not exposed to my knowledge to anything), an allergic response, an infection of some kind, extreme GERD, some kind of fibromyalgia or chronic pain condition, some kind of trachea injury, or some odd psychiatric response. But Im not very good at self diagnosing.\n\nOther pertinent history: never smoked, no alcohol, no drugs. Tried Symbicort, Pepcid, anti anxiety medication, antacid, still worsening. My doctor most recently suggested nasal saline and Tylenol and wait and watch for a month but its now almost unbearable. Extensive mold issue discovered in apartment I was living in for months that went unnoticed and have since moved out (fault of my landlord)  I developed bad shortness of breath while living there that nobody could figure out but improved after leaving. The burning got bad after spending nights in a couple hotels with strong cleaning odors and scents after moving out of the moldy apartment  I first noticed them then (I woke up with agonizing burning in my respiratory tract and chest) and theyve proceeded since then; but I doubt a chemical burn from a hotel room is possible?? This worsened as well after I got a virus for a week or so. It was preceded by several months of shortness of breath and chest pain that doctors thought was stress but now seems likely related to mold conditions I was in at the timeS Lastly this technically began the day or so after a ct scan with contrast but I doubt iodine contrast could cause ongoing burning sensations as a reaction several weeks out?\n\nGiven that I now cant go anywhere without severe burning pain I will probably return to the ER. Any ideas for what to say to get this taken seriously? I think Im getting written off as young and healthy with normal test results but I genuinely cannot take the pain and its impairing daily function and terrifying me. Mostly because its worsening and I thought it already was unbearable. I also have no idea what is triggering it so am extremely unclear what to avoid or not  eg I dont know if I can take the subway bc I dont know if itll set it off. Doctors act like theyve never heard of this complaint which is even more terrifying. I really want a clear diagnosis and fix. It feels like if it gets any worse I literally wont be able to breathe anywhere but doctors keep acting from the reassuring workup like nothing abnormal is happening and Im just being unduly anxious about symptoms. They think Im safe to pursue specialists outpatient but thats taking months and the pain is literally now agonizing. I think something may be getting lost in translation. Any help very much appreciated. Im at my wits end and just wish this could get a diagnosis asap  it is terrifying me because its so weird and painful and has reduced my quality of life so much even if the work up seems okay.'"

I am in a foreign country and I am afraid. \n\nMy partner (29m) was traveling from US to EU on Wednesday. Since we both love oysters I bought some of them in a restaurant where we enjoy to go. We had them on Wednesday and Thursday. He started vomiting, having diarrhea, terrible headache and fever (up to 38,2C/100,8F) the next day. On Saturday after he woke up he felt good. We taught that he had a bad oyster (they were all alive, we did smell check and trust our perception regarding the taste). On Sunday we traveled to Croatia for a month. Once we arrived I (28f) got period, which felt weirdly crampy and overall painful. On Monday it got way worse regarding the pain, I got a terrible headache and fever (up to 38,7C/101,7F, mostly fluctuating between 37,5C/99,5F and 38,5C/101,3F). No vomiting, no diarrhea. Yesterday (Wednesday) my mom started to get symptoms (feeling crampy) and we were in contact on Saturday. My nights are terrible, the pain gets way worse. I also experience occasional 10/10 pain scale cramps. All my intestines feel inflamed and are sensitive to touch. On Tuesday I went to get checked during the night by the rescue team - they touched my whole stomach, took my pressure and told me to come the next day to get my blood test. I returned the next day (Wednesday) for a blood test. While waiting for my blood to be taken I got the worst diarrhea and I felt way better after it, which made me feel very optimistic. I even become more happy to talk and have a conversation. For blood test they said that CRP is high, which makes sense, all my intestines feel inflamed. They prescribed antibiotics, which I didnt take yet. I am unfortuntely extremely sensitive to most drugs (also to food), so I have strange fear taking anything (always bad reactions). Unfortunately after yesterdays good day, the night was terrible again. I am also done with my period. Today I am struggling with cramps and pains still. Its even hard to walk due to the movement of the intestines. \n\nAny recommendations? I am trying to drink a lot. Can they just based on CRP know for sure it is bacterial?

From Portugal.\n\nI had a deviated Septum and always breathed more through my mouth since childhood. In January this year, I decided to get a septoplasty to try to improve things (plus a turbinate reduction), but one of the tampons escaped from my nose somewhere after the surgery without my perception and affected me into having a worse result after the surgery than before, specifically almost not being able to breathe through my right nostrin due to some deviated structure (septum) in the middle of the nose.\n\nIn the following links are attached an MRI of my nose before the surgery and two photos, one of my right nostril (in detail.. sorry) and one of my left nostril. Therefore, showing the issue after the surgery.\n\nThese pictures were taken 3/4 months after the surgery.\n\nThe past Monday, the doctor operated on me again and this time made sure the tampons didn't move with the use of sutures, and the relief after removing both was definitely better than the prior time when I only had the one on the left nostril to remove.\n\nHowever. I still see a big bulk red wall in the right side of my septum (through my red nostril) and don't see any cartilage looking to the middle of my nose through my left nostril, which leads me to believe I still have a very accentuated deviated septum to my unfortune.\n\nMy breathing through the right nostril is definitely better than after the first surgery, but that would be easy since after that surgery I barely breathed through my right nostril.\n\nI know it's still early to draw any final conclusions, but really, my right nostril view now still looks very much like the one on the photo prior the second surgery.\n\nI found a a medical condition of a septum called septal haematoma that can arise after a trauma or a surgery.. after 3/4 months of recovery, my septum right wall still looked really red and irritated.

I\'m hoping for some constructive feedback about what level of concern I should have.\n\nWhat happened:\n\n2-3 weeks ago I noticed my 3rd toe on both feet was discolored, being purplish from proximales to distales including under the nail. I applied pressure across the whole of both feet thinking there was a circulatory issue. Pressure did not turn the skin white. It just remained the same color. There was no pain. It was like this for 2 days, same two toes.\n\nI took 2 separate fasting glucose tests a few days apart which were 92 and 87 since there is family history of type II diabetes and also cardiovascular disease. My blood oximeter is between 97-98. I thought perhaps I was developing a disease/complication from either of those.\n\nThe color resolved but there appeared to be bruising under my 3rd toe nails which you can still see in the photos I took yesterday. The location of this bruising hasn\'t change, nor has the shape. It hasn\'t faded. I thought I must\'ve jammed my toes somehow and put it out of mind expecting it to be fine.\n\nBut about 10 days ago I noticed the spot on my right 5th toe above the nail. I estimate a 3.5mm diameter. I thoroughly believe it appeared (practically) overnight. I would have noticed it when looking at my feet just days prior, I\'m sure of that. I thought it was a blood blister and I poked it with a sterile needle but only got yellowish lymph fluid (I assume.) I thought maybe a thrombosed cherry hemangioma and have been waiting for it show signs of improvement. It appears consistent today with when I first noticed it. Unwisely I poked it again and it bled a healthy amount of bright red.\n\nMaybe 4-5 years ago I noticed a mole or freckle at this exact location that was never there before. I specifically remember remarking how it was new and seemed to be in a strange place. But I forgot about that. However, when I remembered that there was an acquired mole/freckle at this same spot I basically came up with should I be worried about an acral lentiginous melanoma?\n\nWhere I\'m at now, things that are starting to worry me:\n\nWhy would both my feet get discolored and show the same ""bruise"" markings under my toe nails? It seems more logical that these are all somehow related and that this spot is related to something other than a melanoma. Could a melanoma cause the exact thing on both feet? Or must there be a coincidence that I somehow injured my toes and don\'t remember it and this spot shows up at the same time?\n\nI have noticed an increase in my general body pain over the past 5-6 months. I wake up with headaches daily and take 1g acetaminophen 3x a day but it is becoming less effective. I\'ve added ibuprofen which sometimes helps but not often. I have shoulder and joint pains that I believe are just old sports related injuries but the pain is worsening/becoming harder to deal with.\n\nSo, does any of this ring ""very concerning"" or can I wait another 2-3 weeks and see what happens?\n\nThanks in advance.'"

At the time, the ER doctor warned us that this could be genetic and her children should get screened. Only 1/4 of her kids did (not my mother), though my aunt did not have it.\n\nSince then, Ive had two PCPs both express concern over my genetic predisposition to this, but neither have suggested I seek out any testing myself. They have all been more concerned with my familial history of heart disease, though my BP is always the low side of average and my cholesterol is good.\n\nMy question is: this weighs on my anxiety a bit and lurks in the back of my mind. Should it? \n\nAfter I had COVID in December of 2021, I had/have lingering palpitations that occur randomly (albeit they have grown less frequent the farther I get from COVID). I did multiple EKGs, an echo, and I wore a heart monitor for two weeks (it was meant to be a month but I had an allergic reaction to the adhesive). That all came back normal minus some extra beats the cardiologist said a good percentage of healthy individuals have. I know the echo mentioned the upper aorta being normal but I dont think they were concerned with the whole picture at the time.\n\nHow scared should I be of this?\n\nThanks, you folks are so great for answering our questions.'"

All previous appts/ER visits have been mostly unhelpful, and more focused on treating pain than anything else.\n\nShe's 22F, non-smoker (occasional THC vaping), 5'4 ~220 lbs, taking Prozac and hormonal BC, well-managed asthma from childhood.\n\nUntil October of this year, she was a pretty healthy and well of college student, albeit overweight and with anxiety. Now, she can't go a day without vomiting, has near constant diarrhea, diffuse, extreme abdominal pain (to the point that she can hardly get out of bed), tingling/nerve pain in limbs and lower back, and some concerning trouble concentrating/thinking recently. She's also had periodic boils (with staph) in her armpits, groin, and on her chest. The strangest symptom is random yellowing of her fingertips, which is usually paired with similar yellow/brown splotches on her hands and face. These come and go, lasting about 2-3 days before fading (on multiple occasions). \n\nA ton of lab work has ruled out Crohn's, IBS, UC, diverticulitis, etc- the only unusually findings from the endoscopy and colonoscopy are ilial abscesses. Her ALT and CRP are pretty elevated, as are WBCs. ALT in particular has just continued to rise (60 to 90 at the most recent ER visit). She's in a ton of pain, and barely able to function :/\n\nLatest prescription is gabapentin for the pain (and the most recent ER doc decided to order a full drug panel instead of doing any meaningful tests ). The scary part is that things just seem to be worsening, and there's no sign of her symptoms letting up. \n\nI have some background in healthcare, but am stumped (and obviously very worried).

Undiagnosed/unknown reaction to meds that metabolize through liver since September 2022, unknown reaction to steroids in July and August 2022).\n\nI developed pudendal neuralgia and interstitial cystitis last June. It took weeks to understand what the pain was and get dxd, and about 2 months before Gabapentin fully kicked in. In that time, I took MASSIVE amounts of meds- 4/5 rounds antibiotics, tons of ibuprofen and naproxen (at the same time), aforementioned gabapentin, aloe vera, marshmallow root, CBD, rx Azo for uti pain, a couple other supplements, and steroids.\n\nI do not understand the reaction I had to steroids. First was a topical foam applied to my genital area. At first it worked great, but after 3 days (of 5 day course), the pain came roaring back and I had to stop for the pain to subside. A week later I started a methylprednisolone pack, 4mg 6 times a day then 5 times a day, etc. worked great until day 4 of 6, then pain came roaring back and I had to stop. About 4 weeks later I had a nerve block thru the buttock to dx the PN, 2 weeks later had a nerve ablation. Only difference in the 2 injections was .5 ml dexemethesone during the ablation. Within an hour, that leg was literally completely numb, and I felt odd sensation like swelling internally, it took all day for this to subside. I now think the pain in the genitals the first 2 times were also swelling as well as localized pain.\n\nIts now been 6 months and things have calmed down. I now only take gabapentin, upped from 600mg a day to 900mg and that is managing my pain as well as the nerve ablation that was done. However I have some kind of inner ear virus that has caused sudden significant hearing loss in one ear and Im seeing the ENT on Thursday. I know the treatment is a course of high dose steroids, for any chance of recovering hearing.\n\nI am freaking out. The course is 60mg prednisone, much higher than what I took last summer. I dont know if its safe to chance it. is it possible that these weird reactions were caused in part by all the other meds??\n\n My immune system is out of whack, I developed hypersensitivity to most other meds because of this (I\'m sure I overloaded my liver), in September, but the manifestation is different. Gab seems to be the only med that doesnt do that, but Gab metabolizes through the kidneys and anything that goes through the liver causes intense upper back pain after several doses (I can take a dose or 2 without issue).\n\nI know steroid allergies are really rare and this never happened before, but I don\'t think this is an allergy as there is no rash, itching, hives, etc. I have to choose between trying to save my hearing and a unknown but potentially catastrophic reaction if I take them. Please give your opinions.'"

He then underwent directed radiation therapy on the part of his brain where the tumor had been, followed by starting Keytruda and chemotherapy. He finished chemo, is still undergoing the immunotherapy, and started another round of directed radiation, this time on his lymph nodes. Over the past month and a half he was feeling great and even returned to work part time at his construction job. \n\nLast night on his way out of the house to go to dinner with my mom he stopped dead in his tracks, sat down in a chair, and lost all ability to speak. He was rushed to the emergency room, then to another bigger hospital from there and they are now saying that the seizures were a result of brain swelling, but they don't know what the cause is. My question(s) to you all is this: how likely is this to be infusion-related if he hasn't had any side effects previously? I'm aware that brain swelling is an incredibly rare side effect (less than 1%) and there was a week of time between his last infusion and the incident last night.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12r9p3p/adderal_side_effects/,b'Adderal Side Effects',"b'Hey all, I am a 21y/o caucasian male, approx 5\'9, 124 pounds; chief complaint - testicular retraction, been going on for about a week now; h/x - systolic hypertension, panic disorder, ADHD-C; meds - clonazepam 1.5mg as needed (dependent medication), gabapentin 900mg as needed, hydroxyzine 50mg x2 as needed, propranolol 10mg x4 daily, lisinopril 10mg. I use nicotine cartridges and go through about 4 pods every week and a half, I have been decreasing the amount I use steadily to quit. No alcohol or illicit drug use, I always take the medications as directed or take them more conservatively, prescribers are aware of this. TLDR below as well as a divulgence into information regarding this symptom. \n\n(TLDR; Is it common during ADHD treatment for your testicles to latch on to their body like they are holding on for dear life with no pain, but slight discomfort due to this? Also, a smaller question, has anyone else had increased urination due to this medication?)\n\nI recently started taking Adderall (adult ADHD) as prescribed by my psychiatrist. Adderall was prescribed to treat panic disorder (I know lol) and ""severe"" ADHD. I have a pretty big question as it relates to other peoples experience with this.\n\nMy doctor titrated me up from 5mg a day to a 30XR in combo with a 10mg IR booster midday and a 5mg IR spare dose if deemed necessary by me all in the time period of 3 months. I have no problem with that but as of the last week or so I have been having a side effect that is different than any of the others, I am not too concerned, I just really want to see what the general population experiences and if it is the same as mine, and what people have done to fix this side effect.\n\nMy testicles retract almost as if they are buried in snow. There is no pain at all involved, but it can be uncomfortable, especially if I am in an already stressful situation and I have a generalized uncomfortable almost tight feeling in my groin. My experience with Adderall is that I tend to fixate on this, hence making the problem worse and it becomes a circular issue. I think about it, it gets worse, it gets worse, I think about it more. I am not too sure why this is happening all of a sudden. I understand the pharmacodynamics of amphetamine and Adderall\'s ability to decrease testosterone and decrease peripheral blood flow due to its action as a sympathomimetic, I just am praying I am not the only one experiencing this lol.\n\nI have contacted my psychiatrist as it relates to this but he has yet to respond. I am truly afraid I will be taken off this medication. I am a junior in college and feel like a different person with my grades increasing, I am becoming more extroverted and talking to people, I work in an ER and it has allowed me to be above and beyond for patients, I am completing projects before they are due, building new meaningful relationships, having the motivation to just do stuff, and more importantly, it is controlling my apparent ""severe"" symptoms perfectly.\n\nMy main goal of this post is to see if this is common in others who take Adderal, I have seen posts regarding this but I am looking for a fix that is not taking my prescribed benzo every single day as that is outright unhealthy and feels like medication abuse. I kinda just want this side effect to go away and see what others have to say about it. Should I fight through it and it gets better? Or should I give up and just ask my psychiatrist that I wish to discontinue treatment due to my now fixation on it. Worth noting that it is only a problem when I think about this, but you\'d figure if I am making a reddit post asking for help then I am constantly thinking about it.\n\nAlso, random question, is increased frequency of urination while taking this medication common or is it just my urine PH forcing the amphetamine out causing increased urination? Or is it just due to the increase in fluid intake due to mouth/throat sometimes feeling dry.\n\nI have a lot of things at my disposal for stopping this problem in its tracks, it seems people suspect low dose benzo will help or a beta blocker will help. Beta-blocker has not been successful for me, low dose benzo on the other hand has extreme improvement at the cost of treatment of my ADHD symptoms. It is a tough decision for me, do I sit right here and bare the slightly unpleasant feeling caused by this, or do I discontinue treatment because of it. The main fear is the use of benzo frequency increasing to control this side effect once class is over and homework is done.\n\nI almost never use the benzo for the comedown unless I need to sit down and calm down, I feel as if it is an unhealthy habit to form and the last thing I want is to develop a tolerance to the benzo I am already dependent on and have taken for over 2 years now at a stable dose and weekly regimen. I am taking prescribed 1.5mg clonazepam every 2 days, infrequently every day depending on how stressful a day at work it was/if I worked a 12hr night shift, extenuating circumstances is my current issue relating to ADHD treatment with Adderall as using a low dose of the clonazepam or just waiting it out seems to be the best bet. I usually use just about everything else to assist me in stopping this side effect and if I want it to go away immediately I can make it happen using everything I have at hand (which is PRN). If there is no success after approximately 30-45 minutes I turn to low dose benzo, but hardly ever 2 days in a row.\n\nI just really want some support here and maybe some recommendations as to how to potentially stop this testicular retraction and if this is something that is worth discontinuing ADHD treatment for, I don\'t see it being worth it but if it continues on constantly I might reconsider that statement.\n\nThanks for any input guys and sorry about the long post, got a little carried away.'"

Since starting it I noticed it hurts my stomach, even if I take it with food, causes headaches, general dizziness, and worse of all gives me brain fog. I tried searching online for side effects & all I could find was stomach issues. All I could find on interactions is taking it with antihistamines *in theory* might make one or the other ineffective.\n\nI take a stimulant for ADHD most days & thought maybe the Betahistine is reducing the effect of that someone (one is a vasodilator and one is a vasoconstrictor, for example).

Since I am on such a low dose & already have side effects, I don\'t think it would be possible for me to be on a potentially therapeutic dose.'"

It was done at a hospital and I initially said no to it multiple times because of the radiation risk but they eventually convinced me and I also agreed because of the fear of not knowing. My blood tests and CT came out clear but I can't shake the feeling that something felt odd or not right after I had it.\n\nI did not feel anything immediately other than a warm sensation and my head pain weirdly subsided over time after this but I immediately felt some weird sensation on my neck that I ignored. Now fast forward 1-2 months later and I have really weird pain on the side of my neck that isn't going away and it's in the same spot where I initially had felt a weird sensation after the CT scan. Now I'm not saying it's the CT scan directly because it could be a number of reasons and it could just be psychological or coincidental. However, I have not changed anything with my lifestyle since then that could cause this. I exercise, eat healthy, get a lot of sleep on a firm pillow, and sit with correct posture on an ergonomic chair.\n\nI've read a lot on people stating that the CT scan only gives a small amount of radiation and it would only pose a risk if the CT scan was done constantly but I think there's more to it than this. There's a non-zero chance that it increases the chance of you developing cancer based on numerous studies and it might not be immediate but give it 6-7-8 years and it's possible you could have cancer caused by the cell damage or mutation of your genes that the radiation could have caused. Then reading from others who have had CT scans and are fine makes me think of people who smoke cigarettes and don't end up with cancer. I also don't get the comparison of radiation from airplanes or regular life because this is radiation that adds up over time and not all at once as opposed to the CT scan giving you a concentrated dose of mSv all at once to your body. I don't want this to sound conspiratory and I know most don't have any adverse effects to it at least immediately but I'm just worried about the current and future side effects of the CT scan and not sure if anyone else had experienced anything like this. I feel afraid even explaining this or writing it out because of it potentially being labeled as paranoid but I just wanted to ask what other's viewpoints or experience is on this.\n\nHave any of you had CT scans that you could tell have caused you to feel worse or develop anything? I know it can be a great tool for diagnosing things and I am not trying to discredit it but it would be good to hear the other side of the potential harm that it could cause.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12hl9mq/iud_side_effects_or_not/,b'IUD side effects or not?',"b""I (23F, not on meds, no smoking no drinking) have been having many vague or minor health issues over the past few years. I have quite severe fear of going to the doctor so it's tough for me to keep going back for this. Recently I've started to wonder if some of them are connected to my IUD, but my doc doesn't think so even though some are listed as side effects on the Mirena site.\n\nI have a Mirena IUD that was placed in 2018. The placing was very painful and stayed painful for a week or 2, which led to me getting an ultrasound, but it was placed correctly and no remarkable things were seen on the ultrasound. My cycles got irregular and then my periods stopped within a couple months, I only sometimes spot a little usually after intercourse. I recently got another ultrasound and the IUD is in place correctly. Now I will list the symptoms I think might be connected to the IUD:\n\n1. Recurrent BV and Candida. I got a UTI in 2021 that got treated with antibiotics and right after I developed a vaginal infection. Tests showed it's both BV and Candida. It's now been almost 2 years of treating it and it coming back. I keep it clean, don't do douching, we've tried Clotrimazole and other similar tablets and creams, we once tried antibiotics when it got really bad, tried waiting it out, tried using condoms, or abstinence, all after advice from a doc. All of these seemed to work at first, but it just comes back. I am cleared of any STIs and had a clean PAP smear recently. In this time I've only been with one partner and he's also had irritation and rash on his penis when I have the infections. In those times we abstain, but it usually comes back for both after a while.\n2. Pain during sex. I feel pain around my womb during sex since I have my IUD, though it got worse in the past year or two. My doc says I'm not supposed to feel it but I really feel the difference. My partner also feels the IUD and my previous partner felt it too. I also started feeling pain in lower left and right abdomen, in general but especially during intercourse, which I recently found out is due to:\n3. Cysts on ovaries. In my ultrasound in 2018 my ovaries were cyst-free. Last year during intercourse I felt a sharp, horrible pain, the worst pain I've ever had, and an ER visit later we found out it was a cyst on my ovary that burst. I didn't know I had cysts but now I had many on them. At the ultrasound I recently got I didn't seem to have cysts at all but I know they can come and go.\n4. Other than that I have general symptoms that got more frequent over the years, like migraines, nausea, vertigo, random infections, pains in lower abdomen, pains in pelvis, bloating, VSS, and more, I'm not really thinking these are related and they're not my main issues, but they also add up and have gotten worse over these past 5 years. Same goes with dissociation, I have mental illnesses that have led to me feeling quite dissociated most of the time and this has started and gotten worse since 2018. I don't think it is the IUD for this either, but I have been wondering, if I get the IUD out, could it have a positive effect on any of these symptoms.\n\nI have visited my doc with this but he says none of these are probably related to my IUD and he advises against removing it. I went in sure I want it removed, if only just to see the effect, but now I'm not sure anymore. It would suck to have it removed and find out all these symptoms stay or get worse, and then also have period pains again. I have birth control covered by my health insurance so I could get a new one in that case without cost, but the pain I had last time placing it makes me nervous. And I learned this Mirena can now stay until 2026 (when I got it placed it was 5 years, now it is 8!). It would be so much more convenient to leave it in and not have to think about it.\n\nHowever, I also worry about these symptoms. Every time I get those ovary pains I fear a cyst is going to rupture again. I worry this recurrent BV and Candida lasts and keeps making this impact on my life or even leads to more serious complications. The womb pain sometimes gets so bad I can barely get out of bed and I got tears on my vulva from the vaginal infections (when abstaining and I am nulliparous so I'm pretty sure it was the infection). The chance removing my IUD could have a positive effect on any of these is very tempting, but after my talk with my doc I just don't know anymore. I'm also not too sure what else I could use, as many birth control methods can have similar side effects, I am forgetful and I have had condoms break in the past. It would be so convenient if all of this is not the IUD and I can just keep it in! I just want to know. Thank you for your time and your service! I am studying to work in healthcare and deeply respect you heroes."""

But it isn't that bad due to the following problem. \n\nWhile on Metformin, I have lost maybe 1 kg of weight ( I know it is not a weight loss pill, and the weight I 've lost is probably from the diarrhea). However, that is not the issue. \n\n**What I am worried about** is the absolute lack of appetite I have had over the last month. Like, to the point where I can go 24 hours without food and be totally fine. I feel no dip in energy, no hunger, nothing. Maybe a slight headache but besides that there is no difference. And I am getting worried I will fall into the rabbit hole of not eating at all. Like, I have food i nthe fridge, but I feel absolutely no need to eat it, which for me is unusual. I know Metformin does this where it finally sends the brain the right signal about when the stomach is full, but this has now reached a level I'm not entirely sure about. \n\nI know about counting calories, I know about needing at least 1200 calories for the body to function, and before I was on Metformin, I would really feel the fluctuation in energy if I ate or didn't eat. But right now, because I feel no difference, it is difficult to understnad if I even need to eat anymore. Is it even healthy. And due to everything giving me diarrhea, there are days where if I have to be somewhere, or take the bus for 2 hours, I just don't even want to eat for hours on end, out of fear for the side effects. Is it safe to not eat anything for 24 hours while on Metformin?"""

Taking Fexofenadine 120 mg daily, Prednisolone (8 lots of 5 mg tablets, 40 mg total) daily, Rigevidon daily, Medikinet XL 20mg daily and Vitamin D daily. \n\nThe Fexofenadine and Prednisolone I have been taking since Sunday. The rest of the medication I have been taking long term.\n\nYesterday I noticed that my mood was starting to be quite low and I was experiencing intrusive depressive/anxious thoughts. In the evening I started feeling very euphoric for around half an hour, which then flipped into major depression within an hour with very negative and intrusive thoughts (some of which verge on suicidal). This then led into an episode of sobbing with no major reason for it. The last few days I have had trouble with getting to sleep and have not slept too well. Today I am experiencing brain fog, confusion, memory issues, fatigue and difficulty focusing, swollen/bloated looking face as well as continuing low mood and sometimes where I can't stop shaking. \n\nThe prednisolone was prescribed as I was having some issues with my feet for a couple of days (Thursday - Saturday last week). The issues were that they would start to feel very warm and itchy, and looking at them I could see that they were swollen. The itchy feeling would then turn into a burning, extremely painful sensation with moments where it would feel like I was electrocuted and my leg would spasm. At the worst time caused me to cry due to the amount of pain. The GP considered that this may be a continuation of a possible adverse reaction to an antibiotic.\n\nThe antibiotic was co-amoxiclav and I was taking this for 7 days after a septorhinoplasty surgery, performed on the 31st of January. A day after I finished taking co-amoxiclav I woke up with hives on my arms. These hives then continued to grow and spread. The day after it had continued to get worse and I was experiencing the day issue with my feet during this. I went to the hospital and the GP there prescribed me Prednisolone (I think this was also 40 mg daily) for 4 days. This reduced the hives by the 3rd day. I then experience the low moods and depression for the next couple of days after this.\n\nAt the recommendation of a doctor I have stopped taking Prednisolone. Is there something else I should do or think about? I have had stomach issues and mild diarrhea for a couple of weeks now since the surgery. I have also lost about 4 kg during this time and have had no luck with regaining weight despite eating more than I usually would. For context, I have struggled with an eating disorder for many years and I have not been a health weight since I was 17. My body has not felt good for a month now."""

From what I can remember this began at 18 when I started birth control and meds for postpartum depression. I dont have specific descriptions for every single med, bc there have been so many, but Ill do my best.\n\nBirth control: Ive taken literally everything available both to prevent pregnancy and help with the PCOS. Mirena sent me deep into a haze of depression, I took it out myself and the fog lifted within 48 hrs or so. The pills and patch made me depressed. The vaginal ring was the worst of all, Ive never self/harmed in my life but i had a really strong desire to cut my wrists and I just cried on the floor constantly. \n\nSSRIs & SNRIs: Zoloft made me have horrible nightmares to the point i was terrified of sleep. Wellbutrin gave me the most awful anxiety, I would literally shake when the subway went by my apartment and think it was going to hit me. Celexa worked for a while but then nothing exhausted increased my fatigue. The rest just caused some combo of SI/extreme emotion and irritability. I finally gave up bc I couldnt continue to put my family through the mood swings that happened until the med got out of my system. \n\nADHD meds: Adderall worked really well-for a few weeks. I felt so clearheaded and like, not disabled by my brain. Then i started to get depressed, the medication worked for shorter and shorter periods of time until it didnt at all, and at the end with each dose the depression and SI would last for longer until I was in bed crying for 3 days and never took it again. Ritalin did nothing except give me awful headaches.\n\nBP meds: Some of these were taken just to see if theyd slow my heartbeat, thats been a problem on and off. I tried 1-3 from every category. Amlodipine gave me the palpitations from hell. Losartan was the WORST, my throat started to feel like it was closing up all the time. I didnt even suspect the med but my PCP figured it out and sure enough i went off and stopped feeling like i was on the verge of death from suffocation. The others just caused some combo of depression/SI/rapid heat rate that was unbearable. \n\nThe most recent episode was trying LDN(low-dose naltrexone). Id heard such glowing reviews for a while, so after basically giving up on modern medicine for a couple years, i thought, hey! Its a new class of medication! Plus Im desperate for anything that might help my fatigue. 4 days of only 0.5 mg and my throat felt like it was in a vise and worse, my throat forgot how to swallow-twice, because i thought the first time was a fluke. I honestly thought i was about to die in the middle of Texas Roadhouse choking on a roll. My salad and ribs came out and I couldnt touch them. Its slowly gotten a week later but still pretty anxious about eating, and it feels like my throat gets weak swallowing too many times so full or not, i have to stop when it starts feeling weird. \n\nSo anyways, I just want to know what the hell is wrong with me? Why do i seem to have such a delicate balance of health that I cant take anything? I feel like my body is the weirdest one on earth, but i know I cant be the only one!!! I know it probably is not fixable, and its terrifying knowing that someday my life may depend on taking a drug, but my body will just say NOPE. \n\nI AM on one single prescription currently, spironolactone for my BP. Somehow its been okay so far, which is great bc my dr was at the end of ideas. \n\nOh this includes weed as well-it gives me absolutely horrendous panic attacks and it can take me days to get over what feels like an emotional hangover-like i borrowed my future dopamine/serotonin.'"

I (26F) started feeling kinda crappy on Tuesday. I thought it was just an after effect of eating so many Christmas cookies since Ive been dieting and losing weight for the last year. Wednesday morning I woke up with a low-grade fever. Not a huge deal, I figured I just caught the flu from some family that had it. I also started itching, especially in my palms. By Thursday it had developed into a rash across my whole body. Not welts or bumps, but red and swollen wherever it was itchy. Hands, forearms, feet, legs, crotch. I also got a cold sore. I washed my sheets, scrubbed in the shower. Today Im still very itchy. Ive never been one for rashes, so Im not sure what this is. Ive been trying allergy medicine and several anti-itch lotions, but nothing is helping. Most of the flu symptoms are gone, but this itch is driving me insane. Is this worth me going to a doctor? I feel like my immune system is giving up, but thats probably dramatic, right?'"

Within the last 5 days, I have confirmed, it is vaping that is causing these sudden onset of symptoms which are: throat feels like it closes a bit/my voice gets a little horse (this will go away in under an hour if I do not vape any more), weird chest sensation (unsure what it is) and lastly, what feels like gas/air stuck in my upper abdomen, right below my ribcage. I can feel air move and it sometimes causes me to burp. These 3 symptoms happen even just after one puff now. \nMy best guess is I've developed an intolerance or allergy to something in these vapes?

Need help managing my mother's multiple health problems, and worry that her specialists aren't really communicating, especially about drugs and their side effects.""","b'Hi everyone. I\'ve been acting as my mom\'s caregiver for 2 and 1/2 years now. She had advanced COPD, heart failure, diabetes (without insulin), and osteoporosis. She is 71, 5\',7"", and 145 lbs. Current daily meds are: entresto (49/51 mgs), torsemide (20mgs), atorovastatin (40mgs), escitalopram (20mgs), aspirin (81mgs), glipizide (5mg 2x), prednisone (10mg), a rescue inhaler, plus nebulized budesonide and duo-neb.  Some supplements like red yeast rice, coq10, multivitamins, calcium/D3, and B-12. She has a few meds that she takes as needed as well. These are: tramadol, lorazepam, and tessalon perles. I also give her 2-3 OTC meds. Mucinex 600 mgs 2x per day and loratadine daily, then Tylenol as needed. She also recently had her first shot of ""prolia"" and thinks she is having side effects from it. \n\nI worry that all of these meds that she\'s on might be doing more harm than good. Her primary care NP recommended the supplements, and the rest of them were started by cardiologists and pulmonologists. Our local health situation seems like its in turmoil, as we seem to see different doctors just about every visit. Each one, having a different opinion... and usually wanting to stop or start new meds. At times it seems like the cardiologist and pulmonologist blames each other. Like the cardiologist says the albuterol and prednisone are bad for the heart, but one pulmonologist says breathing is ""number 1"". \n\nI know the prednisone is catching up to her, but before starting the ""maintenance"" dose, she was having bad copd flares.  She really liked her general NP, but she just left, and we saw a new NP 2 months ago. She wanted my mom to follow up with a orthopedics, and he wanted her to get the prolia shot. So she got that about 3 weeks ago, and my mom is now saying that the shot ""fucked her up"". She\'s having widespread pain, and on the verge of a flare. I\'m reading the side effects, which include respiratory infections... and it\'s like what the hell? Did they not take her COPD into consideration?\n\nI know this isn\'t the place to vent about the medical system, but I don\'t know what to do. I have my own issues, mainly depression and ADD... so I feel like I\'m failing her. I\'m getting confused and distracted with all of these different doctors, specialists, and nurses. Pardon my phrasing here, but are there any doctors out there still who know enough about the whole body and have the balls to take charge of the whole picture here? I feel like these docs here are playing ""hot potato"" and just tossing her to someone else. Is this just what it\'s like now? I remember a time not to long ago, where your normal primary care doc called most of the shots. Anyway, I digress.'"

About 4 or 5 days a week I have episodes that last a couple of hours with my bpm around 150 to 190 while sitting down literally resting. This also happens in the middle of the night and wakes me up. When they stop they stop fast and within a few minutes it\'s mid 40s bpm.\nLast weekend I wanted to enjoy Thanksgiving with my family so I skipped my morning dosage of Metoprolol and just took the evening dosage so my dizziness didn\'t start until the evening and I could just go to bed.  I havent taken my morning dosage since and other than rapid pulse, I feel good no daytime dizziness.  I called my  cardiologist a couple of days ago to let him know I am cutting out my morning dosage but his receptionist said he will call me on October 24th for a telephone consult. \nMy question is, is this safe to do? I am feeling good and can work now but is this affecting my heart and blood pressure in a bad way? Are my odds of a stroke increasing? I just hate to go back on two dosages a day.\nI would also like to add that I have taken a stress test and worn the heart monitor on 3 different occasions. The cardiologist said ""there is definitely something there,"" but didn\'t elaborate other than say it was A Fib.'"

He had a psychotic episode but it was almost 3-4 months after he last smoked. His behaviour was very erratic, he wouldn't respond when asked a question and stare ate you blankly. It started as being over friendly and over-sharing for a month and progressed further into making illogical statements, delusions and once he even hallucinated. It lasted some 2 months and we didn't pay attention to it for a month. Starting second month, we got a little suspicious but we couldn't figure out what was going on for almost a month when he told us he had been using weed for the past 3 years. Then we contacted a psychiatrist.\n\n\nThe psychiatrist claimed it was because of the long-term usage of weed. He took medicines for the psychosis for almost a year and was fine.\n\nAfter 6months or so he ingested cannabis in liquid form and started having weird behaviour again. He had zero inhibitions and would share things we normally wouldn't to anyone. Onset of this behaviour was quite sudden. Again he took meds for 7-8 months and was fine. \n\nHe is generally very reserved and won't talk much to anyone. During his psychosis, he would get very friendly and talk to everyone, compliment everyone, be over-friendly, post statuses on Facebook and whatsapp, try to reach out to everyone. Slowly after taking the medicines he would return to his usual self. This has been my experience.\n\nTwo weeks ago, after he visited his hometown, he has started being more friendly and it is bothering me. Two days ago he met his two friends with whom he ingested cannabis during the second time. But he had been over friendly for the past two weeks. Is it possible that he met them and smoked two weeks ago itself? We asked him if he took something and he denied. ( In the past, he wouldn't lie about it. He would tell openly)\n\n\nYesterday, he spoke very rudely to a couple of his long-tem friends and one of them, whom I know, reached out to me. He was the one who was also present during his second episode so he was concerned. When asked why he did it he said they have wronged him multiple times. Although he knows them for more than 6yrs and has never behaved like that with them.\n\n\nMy question is, can weed cause so much trouble? Granted he used to smoke regularly in the past but after quitting for almost two years, can a single smoke trigger things again? Or is there some deeper issue? Also, if weed is causing it, can the symptoms present itself so quickly the second time but be more gradual the first time and now?\n\nI don't know what to do. How can a psychiatrist find out if it is weed or some underlying issue if both presents same symptoms?"""

Id like to preface this, I have contacted my prescribers office, with no luck, and the pharmacist, who brushed off my concerns and told me to wait a week. Being the anxious person I am, Id like some more opinions in a place where I can better explain my symptoms (the pharmacy was very busy, so Im not sure I explained myself well). Ive also tried rescheduling my follow up appointment to an earlier date, but to no luck. \n\nIm 22, 54, AFAB, my weight is around 126-128 pounds, and Im currently on: \n-100mg of Lamotrigine \n-25mg of Sertraline \n-I also have an IUD, Mirena and have had it since this time last year \n\nAnd the new one in question: \n-25/50mg of Quetiapine Fumarate\n\nMy doctor prescribed me quetiapine to try to help me sleep (my sleep was incredibly interrupted, I was sleeping so lightly). She had me start with one 25mg tablet for 4 days, then up to two tablets. I take them at night, around 8:30pm. \n\nIve been sleeping incredibly well, no complaints there, and Im no groggier than usual. The problem began two days ago, when I went up to two pills. When I woke up after taking two pills, I felt awful. I felt light-headed, I had a headache, and just overall felt awful. I chalked it up to dehydration (I normally drink at least 80 ounces, but had only drank 60 or so), went about my day. That evening though, around 4pm, I was still having issues, and noticed it was far worse the more I moved about (it was Sunday, I was playing video games, sue me lol). I took my two pills as usual last night, at about 8:40pm, and woke up with the same symptoms and more. All of the symptoms get worse the more I move around. Ive had a persistent low level headache (worse with movement), standing and walking about makes me feel dizzy and lightheaded, Ive been shivering on occasion, and Ive occasionally felt incredibly weak and short of breath. Ive been trying to take things easy, but my job requires a lot of bending over and walking, which the bending specifically causes issues. \n\nI know Quetiapine can affect blood sugar and blood pressure, is that potentially whats going on here? Am I just over-worrying? At what point should I go to the doctor? Would it be overly paranoid to get something to test my sugar and blood pressure? \n\nTLDR: 54, 22F, 126-128 pounds, having dizziness, feeling lightheaded, headache, shivers, and occasional shortness of breath when I began taking two of my 25mg Quetiapine tablets. Is this normal or should I head to the doctor? Is it worth grabbing something to test my blood sugar and/or blood pressure, or is that too much?'"

Four days later, I reported feeling fatigued and 4 more days later (8 days since vaccination), I reported feeling like a zombie as if I feel only half-alive (the feeling is similar to how you feel when you took a sleeping pill, or melatonin, but you didn't go to sleep). I do not know how I felt in between the first day of me feeling fatigued and the first day in which i reported myself feeling like a zombie, however. It also felt as if my body did not synchronise with my mental state: for example, if i feel elated while listening to music, or if i think of something that is very exciting and adrenaline-triggering, i would normally feel my limbs coming alive and my movements becoming more speedy and coordinated (psychomotor acceleration). However, since I had this feeling, this was not the case and it felt as if my limbs just didn't want to move even if my mind wanted them to. I was also unable to feel anger as easily and working out has become more difficult because i was not feeling the adrenaline rush needed to motivate me to persevere. I have had 2 more vaccine doses following the one in August: the second one in Sept 2021, and the third one in March 2022.

Thought it was a case of some really bad food poisoning until it happened again, and this time he was unresponsive and had a seizure. Doctors chalked it up to a freak accident. Until it happened AGAIN in March; he was unresponsive for over 15 minutes and seized the whole time until the ambulance arrived. After an MRI, an EKG, CT scan, bloodwork, etc., they said that his heart had released a small amount of cortisol(I think?) and that only happens with a heart attack. This time they put him on multiple meds, unsure of what the issue was. The meds were Atirvastatin, Clopidogrel, LevEtiracetam, and Metoprolol.They did a heart stint and he barely had any platelets or something (I am really bad at this!) but would continue to keep him on meds and suggested due to the seizures, that he have a dyed CT scan. We are STILL currently waiting to be scheduled. They are very confused why he seems to have a heart attack but it\'s also a seizure. He now can tell when the episodes are about to come on, and I\'ll be honest, they seem to be a little stress related.\n\nHere\'s the biggest issue. He has changed, 100%. This guy used to be up early, on top of the world. Happy go lucky, and very sexual. We expected some changes, but not this bad. He can barely stay awake, not that he really wants to. He gets back in bed in all of his free time. He is very, very depressed. He said he feels ""emotionally dead"" and has felt that way for months. He doesn\'t have any desire to have sex or masturbate. When he first started the meds, it was rough and he was depressed. So bad that he called his doctor 7 days after starting, absolutely distraught because he felt like driving into traffic, but the doctors told him he just needed to adjust and unfortunately, this was his best chance at living. But it\'s now been almost 6 months and it just gets worse. He has since talked to his doctors multiple times, they say the same thing. He is on the best meds for what they think is his condition and that other meds could have worse side effects and not be as affective for treatment. Is this seriously the end for him? Is there no hope? Are there seriously no other medications? He laid in bed, all weekend. Barely ate, slept 90% of the time. This is his third weekend in a row.  I\'m terrified for him. Doctors say this is normal. I feel like he should get a second opinion.'"

Ever since Ive been here Ive been assaulted by a barrage of illnesses. Ive also read that a drastic change of environment, climate, and being exposed to different bacteria in the air can affect your immunity as well. Im trying to figure out if I was perhaps at a disadvantage moving to a new city after living in one place my whole life? \n Any extra info about mononucleosis or EBV is greatly appreciated!'"

Worst when I wake up before work (my usual high anxiety time). Goes away mostly, but can still be visible when doing fine work with hands (vet tech - may be difficult to place an IVC for example). Has backed off a bit but still happening 4 weeks later. Adding Naltrexone didn't change. May be bumping up Wellbutrin dose this week and potentially tapering off Cymbalta super slow (previous discontinuation syndrome).\n\nIs this normal for Wellbutrin, or related to alcohol use? My shrink knows how much I drink and prescribed it. I saw in the drug info to not abruptly stop drinking on Wellbutrin for fear of DTs. The shakiness really doesn't change whether or not I've had alcohol or any other differences I can think of. Also I have noticed that my twitching when sleeping, or before falling asleep has increased too. And the Naltrexone hasn't changed my drinking at all unfortunately, so that is the same.

However, nearly 2 years after being prescribed it I am starting to notice what might be side-effects but Im not sure if its more the drug or my HD. \n\nI have an appointment Friday with my physician and Im looking for assistance/advice in deciding whether I should ask for consult regarding the Fluoxetine side effects or if I should take it more seriously as part of a Huntingtons discussion of effects.\n\nThe issues I am having are with short-term memory loss and restlessness in my legs. I am also having what seems to be some trouble with grammar. I can talk fine and all that but Im having a lot of trouble finding the right words. For example, Im a fast typist but Ive been working on this post for about 10 minutes now as sometimes I just cant think of the words I need to use to explain myself correctly.\n\nIn terms of short-term memory loss what I mean isI am struggling to remember what Im actively doing during the day. I struggle to talk to anyone or think about other things while I perform a task because Ill forget what Im doing. Its honestly kind of embarrassing how often Ill stop in my tracks during the day and not remember where I was going or what I was doing. Sometimes it comes back to me, sometimes it doesnt. Everything seems to require my full attention but I am struggling to give it and retain information.\n\nI dont expect anyone to be an expert on Huntingtons here, but my appointments tend to be brief in terms of face time with a physician so the more to the point I can be the better I guess.

Took one day of it on the 8th, my face started peeling a bit and my lips turned pale and had some white spots and my face was also itchy, swollen lymph nodes. Stopped it. Got another antibiotic (Cefdinir) by my doc, took yesterday. Took it and noticed small white spots on lips still, white spots at the back of my throat, and face still itchy. \n\n I still do have some previous effects from Bactrim as stated like a rash on hand and arm and white gums.

Had an ERCP to remove gallstone from my liver duct, developed pancreatitis, then once that settled down I had a lap chole to remove the gallbladder. Everything is healing well. \n\nThe night the pancreatitis was present was absolute hell. I have a pretty high pain tolerance (have managed endometriosis for years) and I was crying and begging for help. \n\nI was given IV morphine, which didn\'t seem to do much for the first several hours. I told the nurse it wasn\'t working, and was told that I just needed more, and could ask for it every five minutes. However it just didn\'t seem to do much, and meanwhile was making me feel worse and worse. Nausea, cold sweats, hallucinations (aural and visual), and dizziness. I kept asking to be given something different instead, and just kept being told I needed to stick with the morphine until my pain was under control. \n\nEventually in the morning I was switched to a longer acting oral morphine, which did seem to do a better job of managing the pain but didn\'t help with the other symptoms, and at that point I had also started to itch. At that point I just stopped asking for pain relief. I had broken skin a few times from all the itching and was unable to sleep.\n\nWhen I finally went for the lap chole I told the anesthesiologist I would rather deal with the pain than have any more morphine. She laughed and said ""Oh there\'s plenty of different drugs we can give you, morphine isn\'t the only option.""\n\nNow, 5 days after taking any morphine at all, I\'m still itchy over my entire body. I can\'t seem to decide if I\'m too hot or cold, I\'m clenching my jaw, I feel restless and angry. I soak through the sheets sweating, and I really can\'t stress enough how itchy I am. \n\nMy questions:\n\nI\'m not upset about the care I was given, I\'m just hoping for answers so I can understand what happened, and hopefully advocate for myself in the future if this comes up again. \n\n1. How long will these side effects last, and is there anything I can do to make them go away? \n\n2. Why was I told IV morphine was the only option and then later told there were plenty of other options to try? \n\n3. I know this isn\'t an allergy, but in future should I tell doctors I\'ve had this reaction when they ask if I\'m allergic to any drugs? \n\n4. Are there other drugs in the same family as morphine that I should also avoid? \n\nThank you so much'"

Name-calling. Harassment. (These had happened online. I know it may not seem like such a big deal but it ruined my self-confidence, and mental health.) And it got worse in 2020, because I got abused online as well And my mental health, got worse to the point where I had urges to kill / harm myself, (I hardly have them anymore, which I\'m glad about.)

And then i started panicking, and said ""mum, mum I think I\'m dying!!"" And I went down on to the kitchen floor.and my brother said ""your fine."" And my mum said ""this is because of your dad."" And then she went to open the door for me to get air. And I still felt weird. And my hands were shaking. (I can\'t remember but I think my mouth /lips was dry.) But the thing is I felt like I was forcing the shaking. Because I was making myself shake (but again I probably wasn\'t. I did not do it for attention, I know that would of been bad. etc I was seriously scared, that I was gonna die in front of my mum and brother.) . But when I stopped my body felt like nothing. And my breathing was a bit weird a swell. And my mum was trying to talk me out of it. And then a few minutes later, I went to stand up, and go upstairs, but my whole body, and legs felt weird. Very weird. But then I felt the whole night, watching tiktok to distract myself. But then next day, my mum told my older brother that I was having panic attacks.

(Like I might die, or something will happen inside my body and ill die.)   \n forgetfulness. (Still have.)   \n hair falling out, slightly. (Just smallish.)   \n weird cold chills at my back and arms. (The slight weird cold chill you get when you\'re sick, or something.)   \n constantly seeking reassurance.   \n weird breathing. (Like when you walk around and your breathing gets heavy in a way.)   \n my heart sometimes making a dropping feeling, and it beats again.  \n \\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n\n\n  \nAnd my symptoms kept changing.  \n   \n\n\n  \nAnd now this year, my symptoms have changed like they have been.   \n\n\n  \nbut my stomach still keeps growling for no reason I lost my appetite, 2-3 years ago when this started, but I feel weird, like very weird like the weird feelings you get when you feel like you\'re about to end up in a hospital? I can\'t explain my weird feelings, and I feel like I can\'t think straight? But I can? But I keep looming at things without blinking for a few seconds and my face was just been blank? In a way, and I\'m getting weird fuzzy feelings at the side of my face. and I\'m scared I\'m dying, or it\'s an illness. But the weird feelings do go away, but they come back after a few hours, or minutes, I know I need therapy, and help but the waiting lists. I\'m trying to learn to cope with it. Because I know it won\'t go away just by ignoring it, and I know as much as I\'m worried for my health know I been through a lot of stress, etc and now I been going puberty for a couple years.Anxiety feels like a nightmare, and I hate it. I wish I could stop feeling constantly weird, and strange etc. It\'s a very very weird and strange feeling and it\'s odd. I can\'t explain anything.   \n\n\n  \nBut I can\'t keep letting it get the best of me because I will just need to learn, to accept it as much as its hard to. I\'ll just accept it and I\'ll keep telling my mum for therapy or even see a doctor It\'s terrifying but i know I can get through this oll run around my house etc etc etc for distractions etc until I can get a therapist which I know will take long, but I hope I won\'t be like this forever and ever.   \n\n\n  \nAnd I also have a white patch on my tongue it kinds looks like milk? And sometimes I feel a very weird weird feeling that something will happen? And most times I breathe I feel something in my throat lime its my heart beat? Or if my heart skips a beat or something when I breathe sometimes?   \n\n\n  \nBut also a good thing is, is that I can drink and eat fine, and I\'m not in any bad pains at all, I just physically feel weird, and I can\'t explain the feelings. But when I sleep, I wake up In the middle of the night for no reason, so that might be from stress.   \n\n\n  \nDoes anybody else experience or know what I mean? I don\'t know why I keep worrying about my health I constantly seek reassurance and it kinda makes me feel a attention seeker.but i also have this weird cold feeling at my back (the cold feeling you get when you\'re sick?) but i have it at my back, and i don\'t have a lot of symptoms of anxiety and it\'s scaring me. are people different with anxiety and stress? do they have different things with it? because i know everybody is different but i\'m still scared.   \n\n\n  \nhas anybody else had this? i feel like i\'m the only person. i think i actually have a illness or something i just feel sick and strange constantly. but i\'m planning on getting stress/anxiety gummies i\'m terrified.   \n\n\n  \nand i\'m thinking about therapy? but i just wanna take small steps for starters.   \n\n\n  \nand i also never see anybody with this same thing as me so i\'m scared.   \n\n\n  \nand my hear also makes a drop feeling, even when my heart isn\'t racing etc it happens out of nowhere, and it\'s weird, and when i breathed in, i like felt it in my throat? and i just feel awful, and weird constantly, it sucks. it really does suck. i just feel like i\'m gonna die or if i have some type of serious/deadly illness etc, i just want it to stop. i don\'t even have a clue if this is normal or not. i just hope others have, had the same things/thing has me. it sucks i feel alone. it feels like something is wrong inside my body and i can\'t explain it i\'m so sick of it. i feel like i\'m about to die any second.okay my body just did something weird and i think my body just bought something up into my throat? i can\'t explain it i\'m scared. am i okay?   \n\n\n  \nI\'m sorry if I\'m bothering anybody, I know others have more serious problems but I\'m just scared. \n\n  \nshould i change my diet, and sleep routine? and get anxiety/stress gummies from amazon? (they probably won\'t work but i wanna take small steps.)   \n\n\n  \nAnd I think all this has something, to do with my stomach. Because my stomach was the first thing that felt sick back in december 8th 2020, so I don\'t understand. Is my stomach okay? And it also feels like my body might bring something up or something? I don\'t understand why did this happen, so suddenly? Did I do something wrong?  \n \n\n  \nBut even if I am like this I can still eat, and drink fine. (Sometimes feel like I might throw up but yeah, I can eat and drink. But i also have a bad diet, and i eat and drink horribly.) I can still go bathroom, just fine. (Never really any problems with that.) I can still sleep fine. (But I do wake up around 1-2 times. Which is probably stress, but my sleep routine is also horrible.)

She started developing a stutter a few months ago, which she never had before, and the only information I could find on stuttering later in life has to do with neurological disorders or direct injury to the brain (which she does not have). If it matters, my daughter has recently been experiencing this thing where she will grab onto her shirt randomly and pull, she says she doesn't have control over it, and she'll tense up and her hand will form this claw type thing. She'll often keep rubbing her jaw really hard which has caused it to bruise, as well as a rash on both sides. She also often has this problem where her legs have to be moving, aswell as her palate itching and feeling like her tongue is swelling when it's not. She's also complained about her body being sore. I'm terrible at explaining so I hope this makes sense. \n\nI thought it was anxiety, but the stuttering and body aching is making me rethink that. \n\nIf necessary, she is seeing a psychiatrist and we've gotten a few opinions but they all said there is an issue, they just can't figure out what it is. They think it'll only start showing at around the ages of 21-23. They think it might be PPD (Paranoid Personality Disorder) the only definite diagnosis she has is anxiety, and even then the doctors didn't specific which type. \n\nShe is 164cm, 55kg. She uses chronic medication called Epilim (lamotrigine/lithium) as a mood stabilizer, 500g in the morning, and 500g in the evening. The doctor did give us Clonam (Clonazepam), but he said to only use it when absolutely necessary (such as during a severe panic attack). \n\nIf any more info is needed,  I'm willing to provide it. I'm just not sure whether or not I should be concerned and have her see a doctor, or if it's  just anxiety."""

She's been violently ill for over a week (possible medication problem?)""","b""Hi! My partner (19F) is too sick to ask any more questions, so I'm doing it for her. On Monday, she started taking a new bottle of Lexapro (which she's been on for about a year with no problems) along with Buspirone as prescribed by her doctor for anxiety.\n\nWell, she got violently ill about seven hours later and was shaking and vomiting and feeling extremely disoriented. Turns out Buspirone is not supposed to be taken with Lexapro, as it's known to cause severe interactions and problems with seratonin levels that can be extremely dangerous. She also couldnt get in touch with her doctor to double check, because he started ignoring her calls. So she stops taking it immediately after we find this out and then another day passes. She's still feeling awful then, and after getting no new information from urgent care, she goes to the ER.\n\nAll her vitals come back perfectly normal at the ER. The doctors confirm it seems like something with her seratonin levels. She got some tests done and and IV and went home completely cleared by the staff, who said she should now resume taking her Lexapro again at half a dose, because she'd stopped after the previous day's illness. \n\nShe took the Lexapro at half a dose, then seven hours later got very ill again with lots of shaking and tingles and hot/cold flashes, similar to the first time but not as severe. The following day, she was almost fine, until she took her Lexapro again and seven hours later she got sick again. Today, she didn't take her Lexapro, but had another bad flare up.\n\nWe're now suspecting she got a bad batch of Lexapro, because we don't think the Buspirone interaction would last this long. She still hasn't gotten it out of her system and she's feeling very scared. We got an emergency supply of a fresh batch of Lexapro too, but now we're worried about how long these symptoms will be lasting, because they're very scary. Her general symptoms:\n\nMost of Day\n-Tingly sensation in neck\n-Strange feeling in head (sometimes like cotton, sometimes like pressure)\n-No appetite\n-Diarrea \n-Anxiety/Weepiness \n-Difficulty doing things and leaving house \n\nTwice Per Day\n-Hot and Cold Flashes\n-Nausea \n-Lots of neck tingles \n-Shaking in legs\n-Face aches \n-Disorientation \n-Jumbled thoughts\n-Strong sensation of being unwell\n-Bedridden\n\nDoes anyone have any other ideas as to what could possibly be going on? Its worth noting that she had an mri about two months ago for different reasons and there was nothing strange detected. \n\nIf it is what we think it is, and it's just a medication thing, how long can we expect these symptoms? She's so scared she's breaking down crying through much of the day, so I'd like to reassure her as much as possible. Thanks so much in advance, and sorry for the long post."""

The affected area was also quite hard. Got it checked at a hospital, with quite a lot of people poking around there (surgeons and the like.) Official diagnosis was an infection and inflammation, I was given antibiotics and ibuprofen. Blood test and a ultrasound scan was taken. Scan didn't show anything of note. Near my naval if I pressed down I could feel a weird hard ball. \n\nI took the meds, and all was well. One thing that struck me as weird was that the tiredness and headaches were dismissed as being unrelated.\n\nI would like to add that I've also been having troubles with an anal fissure that won't go away since the end of last year.\n\nTo more recent events (last 4-5 days): I've been feeling tired all the time and been having headaches again, just like last time. Today my temperature has also been higher than normal. I also out of curiosity poked around my naval, and lo and behold, there is still pain and hardness in the same area. Best I can describe it as is a sharp prickly feeling. Stuck a cotton bud down there and it came out with a putrid smell.\n\nAdditionally, the area to the left of my tailbone has also been aching quite a lot.

Like the brain is literally sinking into your neck/scull, especially before sleep, but also during the day. I am completely aware of my surroundings during those episodes but they feel terible. My head also feels pressure (specially in the back of my head), sometimes my brain feel like they are floating around, like my head isn't attached to my neck, or like it is completely hollow but still kinda pressure-like. I used to get those episodes once or twice a week, then every day and now I get them a few times a day. They last from 10mins to 1hour or usually few hours, and are different in intensity, they feel HORRIBLE and I want to kms, especially cuz I don't know how to explain to anyone what I'm feeling. Everyone thinks im anxious, depressed or scared (and I am!!!!) But i think those feelings are the reason for anxiety and depression, not vice versa. I had tests done, the MRI didn't show typical MS findings, but it did show some abnormalities, that are unspecific. I have found many descriptions similar to mine or some exactly the same on many MS (multiple sclerosis) forums. Can any of you help me out? I am going INSANE! I also have intense brain fog, problems concentrating, migraines (I am on Aimovig - CGRP inhibitor for that), vertigo and dizziness, gastritis, IBS, lactose intolerance, tingling on my hands and feet, hay fever, vision problems and like I said, intense anxiety and depression. I got meds for those, anxiety went away, but those crazy head feelings stayed, also I got severely depressed, so I stopped taking them - after talking to psych. ( I was on Sertraline and then Lexapro).\nI don't know what to do anymore. Im 23yrs old, female and I am living a life of 85yrs old grandma. Could this be a somatoform dysorder? Celiac? Epilepsy? I would appriciate literally ANY answer, ANYONE who feels the same. \n\nThank you. To all. """

Cerazette as contraceptive which means I haven't had a period in 3+ years.\n\nOn Tuesday I had an episode of the most extreme stomach pain (generally in abdominal area, but then seem to move lower almost like period cramps), was worst on the right side. I would rate the pain as the same I give migraines that are 9/10.\n\nLasted all night and was violently sick 5+ times, I felt such intense crazy pressure I honestly felt like something was going to rupture. Had normal BM at somepoint (although this triggered another wave of vomiting). There was a lot of undigested food in my vomit (including breakfast which I'd eaten around 10 hours earlier). Over the next couple of days I still had dull aching, again had normal BM, but streaked with red blood (definitely not from an anal fissure as I could kind of see it came from further up).\n\nHad three days of no pooping follow this, despite trying senna, glycerin suppositories, magnesium citrate and domperidone. Finally went today after having a sachet of movicol- not painful at all but a lot more red blood this time, which came out after the initial BM :/ Right now I have dull aching low down and my stomach muscles feel exhausted. \n\nShould I be worried? My initial theory is peptic ulcer (but I'm not a clinician and GI is definitely not my area!) As I said in the title, I'm submitting my PhD in the next couple of months and really want to ignore this for now.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/aued6u/my_dad_has_been_acting_off_ever_since_a_medical/,b'My Dad has been acting off ever since a medical problem he had',"b'\nThis is going to be a long post, so sorry in advance. Around 2 years ago, I was at my girlfriend\'s (at the time) house when I got a call from my mom to drive to pick up my sister because my dad was acting weird in the car. Apparently he started slurring his words, swerving into other lanes, and was unresponsive. My sister managed to stop the car and call for help and an ambulance came and picked up my father. After doing scans, there was nothing they could tell was wrong with my dad\'s brain (no cancer or any visible damage I believe), so he eventually got sent home and everything was fine for about 6 months. Then, he had another episode at home. He was slurring his words, shaking when he walked, and was barely able to understand anything we said, almost like he was halfway into another mental state and halfway into reality. These episodes started happening more and more frequently, but my dad is one of those guys that never admits he needs help even when he clearly does. My family and I began to fear and stress over his safety, as he became totally incompetent during these episodes and we worried whether one would occur at the wrong place at the wrong time, and the possible effects these episodes could be having on his health. Gradually, my dad\'s behavior began changing even when he wasn\'t having an episode; he would talk slowly, ask out of place questions, and act all shaky sometimes, almost like he was having a ""half-episode"". Even when my mom convinced him to go see a doctor, she said during the appointments my dad would say ""nothing is wrong but the family was concerned"", so there wasn\'t much the doctors could do. Then, one night, I saw my dad\'s leg when he was in pajamas, and it was so swollen it almost looked like he had elephantiasis (there was CLEARLY something medically wrong). I shouted ""Dad, what the fuck is wrong with your leg?"" and he said it had been sore and getting swollen over the past couple days and that morning it began to look like that (the way I saw it). My mom told him they needed to go to the emergency room, so they went the next morning. It turned out my dad had an abnormal amount of blood clots all over his leg, and even in his lungs, which was weird because my dad is a very fit guy in good shape. They put him on blood thinners, and let us know that as long as he stayed on them that he\'d eventually be ok. When he started the blood thinners, my family and I noticed that his episodes had stopped, and he wouldn\'t get shaky and slur his words anymore. He still is, however, very slow with figuring out things, and seems almost unable to comprehend basic conversation and often asks kind of out of the ordinary questions. For example, while visiting home from college the other weekend, I asked my mom if we had ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" on DVD so I could watch it before I watched the third one that just came out in theaters. My dad asked me how I could have it on DVD if it\'s currently out in theaters, so I explained to him I was asking for the second one, not the new one in theaters. He couldn\'t comprehend this, and kept asking me the same question over and over in different ways, as if he simply couldn\'t wrap his mind around the idea that I was asking for the old movie, and that the NEW one was in theaters. Conversations like this occur all the time, and my sister and mom often tell me about similar accounts they have with him while I\'m away at school.\n\nMy hypothesis is that the blood clots my dad had had been getting worse over time, and that his episodes were caused by a lack of oxygen to his brain, and that even though the blood clots are going away and he\'s getting that oxygen now, the sheer amount of episodes he\'s had has caused some sort of brain damage that\'s affecting his ability to understand basic ideas and make rational decisions. I know I\'m not a neurologist, and I hate to self diagnose when I have no medical knowledge or experience, but I can\'t help trying to connect the reasons for these events. I\'m not necessarily looking for a diagnosis or whatever, as I know that\'s hard to do over the internet and I doubt a doctor would do that, but any thoughts on the situation would be very much appreciated. I\'m concerned about the well being of my father, and it seems his understanding of what\'s important has ceased to exist; he used to work all the time to help my family, but now he\'s doing freelance work and hasn\'t been employed for a while, and seems to be totally oblivious to the effect it\'s having on the family. It\'s like a piece of my dad that was once there is now missing, and I\'m extremely worried about the repercussions of it.

This is in addition to general poor vision.\n* Advanced adult Chostochondritis and Pericarditis. Basically tissue inflammation around her heart lining. Her attacks used to be so bad that she required emergency care, and steroids helped the problem but she still gets attacks about once a month. The pain is so bad she can\'t function during them, but fortunately they don\'t last that long.\n* Extremely frequent UTIs. We\'re very careful during intimacy but it\'s a problem that almost can\'t be avoided. She takes antibiotics which helps. Pain killers do nothing.\n* Another inflammation issue from her paps resulted in a cancer scare when a biopsy of her cervix revealed benign growths.\n\nI\'m curious as to what could be causing these issues, if they\'re connected, if they hint at something more serious, .etc .etc. I just want some outside perspective that isn\'t a hand-wave. I have a strong suspicion that a lot of her problems are connected to inflammation and/or neurological issues from head trauma. She hasn\'t been checked out for much of anything except for the Chostochondritis and Pericarditis.\n\nI really appreciate any help!'"

After I went swimming, that night at 3 am, I woke up with extreme pain in that ear. It felt like someone was stabbing me in the ear every time I opened my mouth or yawned or hiccuped. My boyfriend, out of the kindness of his heart.... thought maybe I had a blockage and offered to help douche my ear out with warm water and peroxide. Well, the pain got worse and a couple times he REALLY pressed into that syringe. So I went to urgent care. Needless to say, my ear was very clean, but my ear drum was very angry. I had a ear infection. 10 days after being on antibiotics, my ear is fine. But when I yawn and my ears pop, that ear sounds like your popping a Snapple bottle cap off and it almost feel like theres something tickling the very inner part of my ear. Could the water and syringe have damaged my ear drum? I dont notice a difference in sound or anything. Sorry this was lengthy!!'"

I have not returned because I am out of state. This month, I have been still bleeding, though less, and my cramps are gone.\n\nOn Thursday, I carried heavy groceries. The next day, I couldn't move.

I thought it was normal for a while and now maybe I notice it more? I surprisingly often take a sip of water or try to swallow spit and end up cough/choking for a little while. Since it was just that, I never pursued it as a medical thing other than learning to live with the fact that, if I make it to old age, I will probably eventually die of pneumonia from aspirating food or something.\n\nHowever, my boyfriend has pointed out that it could be a little more than that. We were in the car (I wasn\'t driving, thank god) and listening to a really funny podcast. I took a sip of my water bottle at the same time something funny happened, choked, and then... couldn\'t breathe? Like, I was actually afraid for my life and my boyfriend was just starting to pull over and planning what to do when I finally managed a gasp. I choked and coughed for a while longer but could breathe in between. Eventually, however, I ended up throwing up. Like, a lot. And just felt super out of it. Other than that one incident, there have been two times when I\'ve woken up coughing on my own spit at night. Just, out of the blue I\'m fully awake and trying to calm my breaths down.\n\nFor the record, I\'m 5 ft 4 and 120 lbs so I don\'t think weight could be causing me sleep apnea or anything. I also don\'t tend to snore or wake up suddenly for other reasons.\n\nTyping it out does make it sound kinda spooky but I guess these incidents are so few and far apart that it didn\'t trigger much worry in me.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/41hfpy/list_of_medical_problems_how_to_approach/,"b'List of medical problems, how to approach'","b""So I'm 18 years old, Male, 60-65kg, 6'1, Caucasian.  \nSo I have a few medical issues that I need to deal with. One being severe depression, often to the point of suicidal thoughts and maybe once or twice attempts. I've been prescribed Paxil before, but that made things worse and I Stopped taking it and haven't been to the doctor since. (About a year ago). I have occasional panic attacks, and deal with some social anxiety. (Used to have very common anxiety and panic attacks, stopped after experimenting with LSD and learning how to control it.) I can control my anxiety and panic the vast majority of the times, unless there's a valid reason to be panicing etc. I also deal with extreme insomnia. To the point where it takes me 1 hour 45 to get to sleep minimum, every night. Even after smoking a large amount of marijuana. I'm an experienced lucid dreamer, and I maintain my conciousness into dreams every single night. It is awful honestly. I have a lot of nightmares,(Even whilst being an experienced lucid dreamer, unable to control ANY aspect of the nightmares) involving me getting tortured (And feeling it) 5 nights a week. I get sleep paralysis very commonly due to maintaining my conciousness. I will have nightmares and see my house getting robbed, my family getting hurt etc, in sleep paralysis regularly. I also have restless leg syndrome, and every night whilst im trying to get to sleep I deal with extreme nerve pain 6 nights a week. Feels like a hot burning sensation, so hot. Sometimes my limbs jerk and it wakes me up completely. I also have arachnophobia and every night I feel spiders crawling up my legs, sometimes I see lots of spiders whilst im in sleep paralysis. I think I also have PTSD which sounds weird as I haven't done anything crazy. Quite often I seem to be having flash backs, and while trying to go to sleep it happens a lot. I've seen some very violent videos on the internet, probably seen everything there is to see. Beheadings, torture, etc. Commonly when trying to sleep I live through these images and videos and it is awful. Truly awful. I think I also am dealing with some depersonalisation/de realisation. I'm not sure how to explain it, but very commonly I feel like I'm on the edge of a 3rd person experience.  The room starts to get bigger, my point of vision seems to move ( Seems like Im seeing out of my whole face, idk how to explain it). Things start getting big or small, and It feels similar to a trip. I also have mild HPPD symptoms, when reading text off a white screen. Letters moving like on LSD. I also have no energy, ever. I can't get out of bed, I can't do anything. I don't look after my personal hygiene, I don't look after my relationships with those I care about. Also back + neck pain. This normally isn't a problem seeing as marijuana helps this, but if I stop I know it'll be bad. Just feeling my neck now I can feel a HUGE lump next to my spine in my neck, I assume its a bunch of muscles. Its just like neck to the ball part on the spine. (sorry I don't know how to explain) Before I started smoking weed, I had a few episodes where I was unable to move and just crying non stop as it was the worst pain in my life. Mum gave me some valium which helped. I also get migraines occasionally. I used to get Imigran to help, but it no longer works. I also get a migraine and am nearly unable to function at all if the weather is above 40C.\n\nI don't know how to approach talking about this all with my doctor. Should I be honest about my prior drug use? What medications do you think would help me? Honestly I've tried benzo's  (illegally) before and they are a godsend. If I tell my doctor about my drug use, I doubt they'd give me benzos? I feel like I might need them on a daily basis, but I'm not sure. I smoke weed daily, which I may stop. But sleeping is so hard for a week after I stop. I can stay awake for over 48 hours and be no more tired than if  I was awake 16 hours. ( I start audio and visual hallucinations if I've been awake for over 24) I was once prescribed a really weak sleeping pill and It did nothing for me. I want to tackle these issues, but I need help sleeping immediately, and I need something strong. I've tried meditation exercise and diet all to no avail. A lot of these problems are hereditary. My mother is prescribed valium and lyrica and heaps of other medications from the same doctor. What medications would help me? I tried taking 5htp but that gives me extremely vivid nightmares consistently. I do not want an SSRI, the one I tried before made me extremely suicidal.\n\nThe only drug I use regularly is marijuana. I've previously used LSD,  Shrooms, Ketamine, Benzos, MDMA, A few opiates, DMT, and 25i. I haven't used any other substances apart from weed in around a month now.\n\nI also have something called Horner syndrome. Just guessing I have it as my right eye is droopy a bit like in the photos of the syndrome, and my pupils are regularly different sizes. \n\nMy local doctor (The one my mum sees) is indian and I think english is her second language. She can obviously help my mum who has more serious medical conditions than I, but I feel like explaining all this may be hard for her to understand. Are these issues taught to a local GP? Will she understand what I'm saying? Or should I go elsewhere? New doctor or even a psychiatrist? """

I lift weights around 3 times per week, but rarely do cardio. I maintain a healthful vegetarian diet (vegetarian for unrelated reasons), and make sure to get enough protein, veggies, etc..\n\nAs this post may be kind of long, I will first give an overview of my symptoms, and then provide the background. Please bear with it, as this has had a HUGE negative impact on my life..these ailments have completely changed my perspective on living, and I would give anything to feel better again. A lot of days it makes me question if life is worth living at all (however, I AM NOT suicidal, and would never do something like that, ever.) Anyhow, the symptoms I have been experiencing are chronic pain in my throat and chest. The pain in my throat becomes much worse anytime I try and speak, as does the pain my chest. For my medical history, I have had autoimmune problems, and developed vitiligo when I was in high school and psoriasis (small patches on face, arms, torso) at the beginning of college. I also get sick with colds and such pretty easily.\n\nThis all started in December of 2014, right around Christmas time. I am a singer, and was practicing some singing in my room just as I usually did, when all of the sudden I felt this sharp pain erupt in my throat. As it seems relevant, the singing I do is not that loud or straining, so it doesn't seem obvious I over exerted my voice like someone might in a metal band or something. Anyhow, I immediately stopped singing, and for the next 4-5 hours the pain would not go down. It is somewhat difficult to classify the pain as I've never felt anything similar, but it kind of feels like a combination of being swollen and raw (In contrast, it feels nothing like a sore throat), worsening when I speak. Eventually the pain dissipated, but a few days later, I was practicing singing again, and the same pain erupted in my throat. It deeply saddens me to say this pain has not fully subsided since then.\n\nAbout two weeks later, I finally visited an ENT specialist. He used some mirrors and looked down into my throat to discover that my vocal chords appeared red and swollen. He suspected it could have been caused from acid splashing up out of my stomach, and said it would return to normal in a matter of weeks. As I stated previously, this was not the case. From this point onward, anytime I have used my voice has made the pain noticeably worse. For example, even engaging in a 10 minute conversation will make the pain increase noticeably for the several hours. If I even attempted something like singing, which I have a few times since then, the pain flares up and will take a few weeks to go back to what it was beforehand. If I stay silent, it is much easier to go without noticing the pain. This even led me to go completely silent for all of February (I just wanted the pain to go away.). In early April, the ENT performed a videosocopy and found that my vocal chords were not as red as they were, but were not opening and closing properly. He instructed me to do a month of speech therapy to correct this, which I did. The therapy did help improve the opening and closing of my vocal chords, but the pain was still there.\n\nAlong with the throat pain, I have had a few other strange symptoms which I feel are related. Right around the start of February 2015, I began to feel a sharp, hot pain, right under the left side of my jaw. Upon inspection, I could feel a little lump there. I told my doctor about it, and he seemed to think it wasn't anything. However, the lump is only noticeable if you carefully push into my skin and feel around the area. The pain subsided over the next month or so but the lump is still there.\n\nNow, onto the final problem (right when I thought things couldn't get worse). Starting around the end of April 2015, I began to feel this heavy pain in my chest. The pain is centralized right above my diaphragm, and feels like a combination of burning, swelling and tightness. When this pain began, I also began having heart palpitations. From the end of April until mid June at seemingly random times my resting heart rate would rise to 110-130 bpm and remain there for up to an hour. I am not sure of the reason, but just as it began it stopped (though it did happen again a few times in September and October, but not since). Anyways, this chest pain has continued since April. It may just be in my head, but it also seems to get worse when I talk (and maybe eat?). The ENT doctor could not figure out the cause, so he referred me to a GI doctor. I went a few times, and tried a few different acid reflux medications (pantaprozole, nexium, dexilant) as he suspected that could be the problem, but none seemed to help fully. He also instructed me to stop eating spicy food, coffee, chocolate, etc. which I have largely stuck with. To explore further, he performed an endoscopy at the end of September, and discovered redness and swelling around the thing that connects the stomach to the esophagus. According to the report:\n\nnormal oropharynx\nesophageal mucosal changes suggestive of short segement barret's esophagus.\nerythematous mucosa in the antrum\nnormal examined duodenum\n\nThey biopsied the last three things I listed and said everything came back normal. Since then, I have been back to the GI a few times, but nothing has come of it. I now have a new GI doctor since my previous one retired, and he wants do some ph test with some sort of monitor I wear for 24 hours to determine whether or not I actually am relfluxing.\n\nIn december, my ENT doctor suggested taking out my tonsils, because mine have always been HUGE, and he said it could help with what has been going on, but would still be beneficial otherwise. I agreed, and got them out at the start of January. The recovery from the surgery was slower than for most people; for some reason, I have had difficulty forming certain words since the surgery. It's like my throat has trouble making certain sounds, and my friends and family have noted my voice sounds kind of different. I will be going to see the ENT about this this week. I would have gone sooner, but he was out of the county.\n\n****I'm not sure it's relevant, but I think it is worth mentioning just in case. To help treat my psoriasis, my dermatologist prescribed my a topical steroid called Taclonex. Due to some miscommunication, I thought I was able to continue taking it for as long as I didn't notice my skin thinning where I applied it, but it turns out I was only supposed to be on it for 2 week periods. As a result of this confusion, I ended up using a little bit most days from August 2014  May 2015. I later read online that overuse could impact one's adrenal gland.\n\nThe doctor's have also suggested it's psychological, but it really does not feel like it to me!\n\nSo, that's basically it. Every day I am in a lot of pain, and it makes it hard to live a normal life. I can't sing anymore which was one of my main passions, and it's so hard to focus on my work. I would give anything to feel better at this point, I just don't know what else to do. Please, please, please if you have any ideas, I would be extremely grateful to hear from you. Thank you so much for reading, I'm eagerly waiting.\n\nBest"""

I had a housefire a few months back and since I just can't get feeling back to normal. A list of my worries:\n\n* Fire while we are asleep, starting mostly from the air conditioner in my 4 year old's room.\n\n* My 4 year old sleepwalking out of the house (I did it when I was little). I can't lock the chain lock on the door because if there is a fire (see item 1) how would she get out? But now we've created the possibility of her going outside at night (which I know realistically she'd never do but I can't help but worry.\n\n* Abduction. I'm worried about every little sound when I'm in bed. I think someone is trying to break in and abduct her. One night I just slept in the living room because I was so mental about it. Yesterday, at a wedding at church, I let her sit with a little friend while I sat alone across the room. I couldn't see her from where I sat so I got afraid the lady didn't see her get up and maybe someone snatched her etc etc. I couldn't relax so I faked a bathroom trip so I could check on her\n\n* Accidents. If I don't hear from my husband after he gets off work or if my daughter has gone somewhere with her grandma and are a little late, I've always assumed they've been in a terrible car accident (or abducted). I can't calm down until they've gotten home or I've heard from them.  Also, I still have a monitor in my daughter's room so I can hear when she gets up because I'm afraid if she gets up without me she'll get into something and get hurt.\n\n* Rituals. I have to put the knives turned around on top of the fridge and take the knob off of the oven because I'm afraid someone (her or me actually) will sleepwalk and get them or turn on the oven with a cat in it or something.(lol I know that one sounds ridiculous)\n\nSometimes I just want to cry because I CAN'T stop worrying even when I KNOW it's ridiculous. Then the relief that washes over me when my worry has abated is so intense, I feel totally relaxed.\n\nAlso, I'm really not okay with medication. I've been on things for depression in the past and they've made me hostile, impulsive (which I already struggle with) and angry and I know anti-anxiety medications can have similar effects of anti depressants. Would counseling help me? I can't see how. I was in counseling for depression and it helped a lot but I don't know about for this anxiety. I always get upset/sad when people minimize my fears or make fun of them because they are very real to me.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas about what would help me or if it's problematic?

They became very sensitive to the cold and would not operate properly. These problems started off as almost negligible to becoming very impeding in his every-day tasks. For example, he started to not be able to do things with his hands such as open a beer can, and eventually couldn\'t cut his own food. It is very bad now - even some of the most common things you do with your hands are unbearable/impossible for him to do, such as typing on a computer.\n\nProblems arose after the hands but advanced in parallel, such as problems with his legs. It became noticeably harder for him to balance. Originally he couldn\'t play sports anymore, but just as the hands, problems progressed until now where he can hardly balance. He finds it very hard to walk, and is embarrassed to leave the house as he doesn\'t want people to see him this way. Although this is clearly detrimental physically, it has caused serious mental health problems such as serious depression and anxiety problems. His life is hell right now, and in turn, my mom is struggling to take care of herself as well - She does literally everything for him, and he is miserable.\n\nHe has been misdiagnosed a few times, but the doctors really don\'t know whats going on with him. My mom thinks that he has something (and his doctor said this is possibly the case as well with a referral to a neurological center) called multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). This is typically misdiagnosed as ALS. He is not going to be able to make it to the appointment that he got a referral to though due to the cancer, which brings me to that:\n\nCancer:\nAbout 1.5 years ago, my dad was diagnosed with Melanoma on his inner thigh. It was surgically removed and there have been minor surgical complications, but the cancer did not persist. It was classified as stage 3 melanoma. He had a minor cancer on the back of his neck after, but it was basil cell cancer which was easily removable. \n\nWho knows what:\nThe last two months, symptoms have been progressing with what we thought was the neural problem. He started to have a bad cough, could hardly get out of bed/walk and had a horrible taste in his mouth all of the time. It was extremely debilitating for him. Eventually he couldn\'t even get out of bed and he asked my mom to call an ambulance. On the way out of the house he fainted. He was placed into ICU, and hooked up to IVs. He had to have his heart restarted due to his heart rate being about 139 bpm. They were going to go up to visit the neurological specialist, but before then he had to have a few tests at the local hospital and recover. He had a gi tract which was clear - but when they took the electrocardiogram they found a 5cm tumor in his heart (the specifics i dont know). He is currently being transferred to a surgeon to have this tumor removed. They dont know if its malignant or benign. \n\nWhat im wondering is if these two conditions could have any relation to each-other. I\'m sure there are lots of smart doctors looking into this as we speak, but I dont live with them, i\'m not in the loop and I want to help in any way I can, even if I can just have an idea. Im wondering that if this tumor is pushing on one of his valves (which was making him tired, have a cough), could it have been pushing for a long time such as to cause the neurological symtoms that I mentioned earlier? I figured (and am most probably wrong) that maybe if his heart wasn\'t pumping as well that he wouldn\'t be able to get enough blood to his hands and feet, which could maybe cause the above. Anyways. I would really appreciate any comments on the matter. I understand its likely impossible to say anything with what i\'ve mentioned, but if you can, I would love to hear. \n\nThank you.'"

I've been having worsening medical symptoms for the last few months, which at first was diagnosed as hypothyroid since my TSH was being overproduced, but the thyroxin I have been taking for the last  four months has not changed anything,rather my situation has worsened. I have upped my rather low dosage of 25 mg to 50mg being that only seemed to make it worse. At 25mg my TSH has gone back to acceptable lab standards. Currently my endocrinologist is putting me off the medicine for now as it could be causing a bad reaction from me. I am to wait for a week or two(it's been a week). My symptoms include\n\n- body wide continuous muscle pains, worse in areas of high muscle density,arms, chest and legs. Burning sensation. Has worsened from being uncomfortable 4 months ago to actually having an effect on everyday life, making it hard to concentrate properly (great for incoming end of the year test). No loss of dexterity. Or strength. \n\n- being extremely cold at certain times, maybe only every 2 weeks ( hypothyroid linked I think) \n\n-fatigue\n\n-Continous headaches\n\n-worsening problem of being continuously out of breath. While I am as strong as I was before, a walk will have me lose my breath rather quickly, and I will need to breath from my mouth even when I'm not moving. Discomfort in what I believe are the lungs. Like they are being overused. \n\n-Waking up feeling like I haven't slept,no problems sleeping though \n\n-mood problems\n\nI will continue to obviously solve it through my endocrinologist and gp,but can anyone here connect those symptoms,some sort of disorder that would cause this ? All the doctors seem at a loss at what seems the problem, and I can't think of anything that could cause such random symptoms."""

Myself and one of his other friends drove him to the hospital, but he is refusing to go in and get treatment because he can't afford it (we're currently sitting in the parking lot). His heart rate is a little fast and his blood oxygen level is 95%. He was drugged about 1 1/2, possibly 2 hours ago. He is conscious, aware, and talking, though he is still a bit out of it; we've been keeping him talking and making sure he doesn't fall asleep, but the drowsiness is clearly wearing off and he's mostly just upset (understandably so). He says he didn't lose consciousness at all, but since he was under the influence and none of his friends were there, we can't be sure of that. Based on our friend's and my own personal experiences with drugs (not medical training), we're guessing ketamine, since its quick acting and wears off very quickly, but we obviously can't know that.

Is there any possible way we can safely look after him, observing him for a while and then acting if any of his symptoms change? If so, how long do we have to do that for until he's in the clear?\n\n(If he doesn't go tonight, we will be making the drive tomorrow morning to get to a hospital that's in network for his insurance, but the closest one is about 50 miles away, so that's not feasible in an emergency situation, which this very well may be, I don't know.)\n\nEdit: Typo\n\nEdit 2: He mentioned that the vodka shot he had tasted a little bitter, but since he's never had vodka before, he thought that was just how it was meant to taste.\n\nEdit 3: We convinced him to go, he's doing alright, thanks for the advice y'all\n\nUpdate: We were right, it was ketamine.

Without the colace, BMs once every 1 to 3 days. I have a diet already that should avoid these problems. Plenty of water, fruits and vegetables. I've even eaten prunes multiple times a week for years.\n\n(S) Possible new trouble swallowing at top of throat. It feels like a spot stuff just won't move past sometimes. No fear of choking on the food, it just stops going down sometimes. Doesn't happen often currently, just sometimes. Also occasionally choking on liquids. When drinking, sometimes just on saliva, and its happens sometimes while gargling mouth wash. This really isn't happening often enough I feel like diagnostic tests could be helpful. Couple 2 or 3 times a month maybe.\n\n**Movement**:\n\n(D) Essential tremor (I've had this tremor since my late teens)\n\n(S) Signifcant twitching in arms/hands, legs/feet, some less common twitching that seems to effect my neck/head. Very very very annoying daily eye twitching in right eye. Happens on and off most days.\n\n(O.T or T) Standard MRI w/wo contrast - no problems seen, which rules out MS, right?\n\nSaw a neurologist my GP sent me to. He did a standard exam - movement, walking, eyes, etc. Does not believe it to be Parkinsons currently. Believes tremor happens more while moving than at rest. Its hard for me to pay attention to my tremor and twitching. If I'm watching for it, it is a struggle to know if its happening because I'm expecting it, or if I'm slowing it down because I'm concentrating on it. There just doesn't seem to be a natural way for me to monitor it.  A partner of mine has observed me while I was unaware and watching a movie and says the twitching is constant. The neurologist says the tremor is more prevalent while in motion, though the time I notice it the most is while I'm falling asleep. Some nights there is a very strong vibration in my arms as I'm nodding off.\n\nI can't say I know if I'm experiencing sleep disturbances. I recently purchased an Oura ring that monitors my sleep.  It has a couple times reported movement during REM sleep, but I don't really know how accurate it is. It isn't frequent though. I did have an event this morning when I was dreaming, I was quickly leaning forward in my dream, and woke myself up jerking forward. But this is unusual. I don't experience drastic punching or kicking regularly.\n\n(S) Intermittent weakness in hands and balance.\n\nMy hands are fine 98% of the time, but then just every so often stop working suddenly and for a split second. I've been dropping a lot of stuff. I've broken some dishes, the lids of several of my water thermos cups I use (metal cups but plastic lids). Recently had to replace the screen protector on my phone due to several drops and cracks. I bought a cup recently for my water that has a wide handle that I can fit my hand inside of. The cup holds onto me as much as I have to hold onto the cup. I'm hoping that this will keep me from breaking the lid on it. I've dumped a pan of stuff all over the inside of my oven on a couple occasions. Recently threw dinner all over the kitchen floor. I've always been a pretty coordinated person previously.\n\nThe balance is a bit less common. Is always when I'm moving from being in a lower position to higher. Like laying down or sitting on the floor, to standing. I'm totally fine, then suddenly everything spins and I'm not moving the direction I intended to. And it lasts just a second and then I'm fine.\n\n**Skin**:\n\n(S) Red, painful & flaky skin on scalp & face. Sometimes damp feeling. Head and shoulders helps. Face flares up and gets better over time. Steroids seem to help during flare up.\n\n(D) The allergy doctor I saw told me it was Rosacea. I don't believe this is correct. The medication he gave me for it did nothing (acid and antibiotic creams). The head and shoulders and steroids are much more helpful.\n\n**Mental Health:**\n\n(D) Depression, Anxiety Disorder (On Welbutrin and Buspirone. Buspirone seems to aggravate tremor, though neurologist says it is fine to continue.)\n\n(S) Constant fatigue. - Oura Ring shows no sleep disturbances. I sleep through the night, hitting sleep stages in a way that is normal, and I seem to have no breathing disturbances.\n\nExercise truly isn't all that helpful. During covid lock-down I started running on an elliptical. For 1.5 years I ran 4+ miles, 5 or 6 days a week. The benefit in how I felt was minimal. Which makes it really hard to keep up with, even though I would like to. During that period I was eating great as well. I was at a healthy weight, though have since gone back to being overweight. I do start to feel better following a healthy lifestyle, but not by much and still feel like I don't tend to feel like I have the energy to get through most days.\n\n(S) low motivation, days where focus is very hard.\n\n**Menstrual**:\n\n(S) Severe heavy bleeding.\n\n(O.T or T) Ultrasounds. No observed cysts or problems. No pain. My glucose levels have never been high. I am not diabetic or pre-diabetic. Hormones have always been in normal range. I do not believe it is poly cystic.\n\nI have fought with low iron for most of my adult life. Birth control pills were not overly helpful. IUD was places less than three years ago. It took about 9 months, but then I did see significant improvement. For about a year and a half things were great/normal. My periods were still there, but regular and what would be considered normal for most people. In less than three years, efficiency is wearing off.

I was still weakened for about three weeks after.\n   * Got bit by a housecat (drew blood) in mid January (no swelling, red-line, etc.), so I didn't go to ER\n   * This may be connected to the back pain, I woke up with a immense back-pain (the same spot, under the left shoulder), that made it impossible to sleep back in November\n   * Had a stye over my left eye in mid January, that I pressed too hard. It didn't come out, but instead caused my left eye to swell a lot. The doc prescribe an ointment that dealt with this problem in about a week.\n* Second and Third Week of February:\n   * Unexplained rash over my entire body, last for about a week. Doc said it was an allergy, but was never able to figure that out, since it takes months to get an appointment with a skin doc here.\n   * Trouble digesting red meat and other meals\n* Fourth Week of February till End of March\n   * Started with stomach problems, presumed to be Gastritis, with severe Heartburn. The ER precribed Protonix, which helped a lot. A few weeks later, I did a gastropocy, which didn't show anything, but was done after I've been medicating on for about 4 weeks at this point, so it may have been healed by then. I didn't eat much and lost around 15 kg because I couldn't eat anything (was 89 kg before, was 74 at the end of March). My doc thinks this was caused by stress. Which makes sense considering I had my college finals, which I passed, at the end of January. To summarize the stomach problems have mostly resided since April, which is why I didn't mention them outside of this summary.\n   * Around the same time my Heartburn began, I started sleeping on my side to reduce the amount of reflux, the next day my vision problems began (starting with Visual Snow)\n   * March 6th, wake up in the middle of the night, unable to breathe. I get up and do some breathing exercise. I presume the stomach acid must have gotten into my lungs. From that night onwards, for the entire duration of the stomach problems I only sleep elevated and on my back and the problems don't return.\n   * Went to the ER more often in the last few months than I did my entire life. \n   * I did multiple blood tests (including Glandular fever \\[aftershocks from cold\\] and Toxiplamosis \\[cat bite\\], nothing out of the ordinary) and ECG.\n   * Due to the headaches, I also went to the MRI. They scanned the head, but didn't find anything out of the ordinary.\n   * My eyes where examined in late February and Mid March by two different eye doctors. Both said my eyes are fine, but suggested glasses. I wore them on-off for about a month from the beginning of March, but they didn't help with the VS, or the light sensitivity, so I returned them.\n   * The second eye doctor said that it may be a blood circulation problem on my neck/back\n* End of March - End of April\n   * Continue to visit a optician (who thinks that neck problems might be responsible for the vision problems). They said I should try to clear the possible circulation and or neck problems sorted out before considering new glasses.\n   * Visit a physiotherapist and osteopathy multiple times.\n   * Vision problems fluctuate, after visiting the physiotherapist.\n* Last Week (May 15th - 19th)\n   * Whilst looking up, I briefly saw black (I have had something similar my entire life, but never that intense or that long, usually it is over in less than a second, this time it were at least 3-5) and heard a loud pounding before sitting down. Since then my neck/cervical spine (nape) pressure worsened a lot. I've been to the ER that night, the doc didn't think it was anything serious. \n   * The physiotherapist checked the neck and couldn't find anything. They think it is stress and also \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry, if I went overboard, I just wanted to give the most detailed explanation I could and I'd rather mention everything I can, than miss something crucial.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent Medication:\n\n* None (exlcuding vitamin Iron, Magnesium, D3, B12 supplements)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExisting medical problems:\n\n* ADH, not that it is relevant.\n* Unidentified allergies (likely to poles and a new one to something that is in speculoos cookies and friy spice \\[only started with the symptoms\\])\n* Stomach problems (likely linked to milk products)\n* Black out when getting up too fast\n* Black out (less than a second) when looking directly up\n* Back problems (one side was less developed at birth, but training was able to mostly even this out. Interestingly enough, it seems to have returned after being unable to work out for the past few months).\n\nDon't drink, don't smoke. Eat mostly healthy and drink mostly water. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for your help. Hope this makes it possible to figure out what is wrong with me."""

Something clicked in me, and I lost all the weight over a year and a half. I also started taking Dutasteride around that year and a half mark for my hair and a few other reasons. Im 510 and dropped to 145 lbs. I got a six pack and all. At the tail end of my weight loss, Id say I probably developed anorexia, especially when looking back at old photos of me. I started dealing with fatigue, weakness, insomnia and dizziness when standing from a low position, but that was about it at first. I was still able to do the things I enjoyed and whatnot. This continued for about 6 months, and then my living situation got to be stressful and continued to be so for quite some time. Eventually, brain fog also developed. At first it would come and go, and would come especially after I ate a meal. But as time continued to go on, it got worse and worse to where today, its pretty much constant and chronic. Ive also just had weird digestive issues. Getting full after eating very little, rarely really feeling actual hunger, bloating etc. The fatigue and brain fog combined has completely ruined my life. I used to go climb a mountain or run a half marathon on a whim, I would always have so much energy and would get shit done; but now Im exhausted even after doing some of the most mild and easy of house chores. I used to be extremely intelligent, clever and have a rich internal monologue, but now Ive almost never got anything going on in my head; its like my brains been taken and replaced with a cotton ball. Sometimes the fog would be so bad, Id slur words as if I were drunk or something, or have problems walking and with balance. To make things even more odd, Ive had random days where I would feel great, and mostly like my old self. The fatigue and brain fog would seemingly lift for 1-3 days or so, I felt on top of the world and had all the energy I did before any of this started. Although, Ive not had a day like this in a while, and Ive never been able to pick out what may have caused it. Ive lost my job now and am in extreme debt from missing work due to my medical problems and how difficult it makes even the most simple of things. \n\nI started seeing a doctor the moment I started dealing with fatigue. No problems were found besides at the time, a moderate anemia. I started making myself eat more and have since then gained like 30-40 lbs over like the next year and a half. Im still pretty lean despite the amount of weight gain, as this was also when I started lifting weights. My anemia drastically improved like two months after I first saw my doctor and found out I had anemia, but it never made it to normal levels. Even now, after so long, I still have a mild normocytic anemia that my doctor cannot figure out. I have no other anomalies in blood work. All nutrients and other blood markers that would influence RBC production is always normal. I was meant to see a hematologist, but considering Ive now lost my job and have zero diagnoses, I do not have insurance anymore and can no longer seek medical treatment. Im being pushed into a corner, and I dont know what to do. \n\nWhen all these physical symptoms started, I was not depressed. I was as happy, energetic and thoughtful as I had always been, but they eventually led to depression for sure. Im scared Ive developed some sort of chronic disease, but the basic blood markers for many of them have been tested and have come back negative as well, but I know thats no guarantee. I was also wondering if its possible that perhaps the depression is the cause of my physical symptoms now, and I just perhaps was unable to tell if the weight gain rectified any physical problems due to this. Or perhaps I still need to just gain some more weight, specifically some body fat? Im still lean enough to where Ive got veins popping out of my arms and legs most of the time, unless Im cold. \n\nI dont know what to do anymore. I cant see my doctor, and Im facing homelessness at this point due to how difficult it is to work now. I think Im soon going to call it quits, if you know what I mean.'"

After I fell asleep, I woke up that morning, and I\'ve basically been ill ever since. I\'m exhausted 24/7, my nose is consistently rotating between stuffy and running, my body aches, my throat aches (with no cough), and I have chills. \n\nFor the first couple weeks I believed it was just a summer flu, but it progressed halfway through April and I was beginning to be concerned.

She checked my ear and saw inflammation and redness, yet no direct fluid. She wanted to treat me for a sinus infection and ear infection.\n\nSince taking amoxicillin, I feel it\'s making some of my symptoms worse. I\'m still fatigued, have a sore throat, have stuffy or runny nose, a migraine, muscle ache, and potential fever.

While I wasn\'t coughing prior to antibiotics, I now have a continuous cough for the past 2 days. Additionally, my throat pain has increased atleast 5x. When I cough, my bowels give out, causing me to shart, rather than fart.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/131htc1/what_is_causing_my_numb_chin_syndrome/,b'What is causing my Numb Chin Syndrome?',"b""If there are any medical specialists out there that can figure out what my condition is, I will be genuinely amazed and forever grateful. \n\nI have been experiencing a long constellation of various medical problems over the last 10 years. I've had a few viral infections over the years (as has anyone) along with severe food poisoning overseas (well, I assume it was food poisoning it was a foreign country so I have no idea what caused it but I was quite ill in hospital). I also had tummy issues for a while, which turned out to be coeliac disease. (I've been strictly off gluten for 7 years though, so I can't imagine that is what's causing any of my current issues. I even avoid certain restaurants). I had multiple hospital visits over the years with sickness very similar to the illness I had when I was overseas, with blood tests being very out of whack (have now normalized), and since I completely cut out gluten (and dairy) those hospital visits mostly ceased to an end. However, occasionally I will eat something that will send my body straight back into gastro mode where my head is burning and my body breaks out in sweats and I feel incredibly sick. This will take about 2 weeks to recover from. \n\nDuring all of this, I also had a brain injury which significantly worsened all of my health issues and I ended up with post-concussion syndrome. Weirdly enough, the migraines began years later. I have chronic vestibular migraines with sensitive to touch facial nerves. The dizziness has been there since the head injury but significantly worsened in the recent years to disabling vertigo. That also started during a bout of severe gastro and burning head which led me to complex BPPV that took many years to finally treat. In the last few years, it progressed to something called Trigeminal Neuralgia & Numb Chin Syndrome. I had suspected trigeminal neuralgia since my injury as I always had shock like sensations on the left side of my face but it wasn't until I experienced heart palpitations and a pain in my tooth that my chin went numb. Following this, I experienced significantly worsening neuralgia and facial pain. I was formally diagnosed with it and placed on medication to treat it. The sensation mostly came back but I still experience some pain, parasthesia and numbness particularly with pressure, touch, certain positions or food! I also experience systemic pain, fatigue and aches throughout the body - almost a monthly cycle.\n\nI also have yet-to-be-treated bilateral hernias post endometriosis laparoscopic surgery. After surgery I experienced significant heart palpitations and heart monitor revealed second degree heart block. Vascular ultrasound revealed mild (less than 15%) calcification. I can feel my heart beat throbbing in my neck almost all of the time, and it worsens after certain foods or positions. I can feel it in my tooth too. It's very unsettling and I quite dislike the sensation.\n\nRegarding the Numb Chin Syndrome, I saw a dentist originally and they said it wasn't dental. I have since been to an ENT specialist, immunologist, haematologist & neurologist. I just seem to be a mystery to the doctors and no one can quite pinpoint what's causing it. I think something has been overlooked or missed. \n\nOther notes: \n born with sensorineural hearing loss \n the most recent CT scan of ear bone revealed mild hypoplasia between the middle and apical turns of the cochlea on both sides consistent with cochlea hypoplasia \n an even more recent MRI revealed that the right superior cerebellar artery contacts the medial aspect of the right trigeminal root entry zone and distorts the nerve. No left trigeminal neurovascular conflict is identified\n the MRI also revealed that there is possibly asymmetric oedema of the left mandible along the expected location of the left inferior alveolar nerve, but this is only partially covered on the coronal T2 DIXON sequence.\n The left cochlear nerve is not identified. In retrospect, the cochlear aperture appears stenotic/atretic on the CT\n chronic neutropenia on blood tests (diagnosed with autoimmune neutropenia) \n\nPlease message me if you think you have an inkling what is going on. I am aware that Numb Chin Syndrome can be caused by many, many things and that I may never find out the root cause but if there is anything you can suggest or have any familiarity with, please contact me. It's driving me nuts that we can't figure out the root cause of what's going on and I don't want to be on nerve medication for the numb chin forever. \n\nCheers! \n\nI hate peace lilies \n\n\n30 \n\nFemale\n\n165\n\n50kgs \n\nCaucasian \n\n2 years \n\nFace\n\nCoeliac, endometriosis, sensorineural hearing loss, bilateral inguinal hernias, numb chin syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, allergic to milk/soy \n\nNerve medication \n\nN/A"""

Most who have shared with me their positive experiences seem to of been trying to loose weight, take a natural approach to a medical problem, and have been a fully grown adult when incorporating the diet. \n  Obviously he doesn't fall into any of those categories, so it may not be the right choice for him at this stage in life.  \n There's so much I still don't understand about it all.

At my physical in January 2023, my blood work revealed a TSH level of 0.01 and a T3, free of 5.7, both of which are pretty out of range and indicative of hyperthyroidism. My GP said we should take the wait-and-watch approach and re-check my levels in 2-3 months. I got my levels re-checked last week and my TSH is now high at 4.65 and my T4, total is low at 4.8 indicating hypothyroidism. My GP now thinks its thyroiditis and that my levels will self-correct so hes just going to have me test my levels again in another two months. While this was going down I remembered my bio mom had mentioned having thyroid issues in one of our previous conversations. I didnt ask for specifics at the time because my thyroid has never been a problem before and she said no one in the family has thyroid issues other than her. In light of what was happening, I decided to message her and get those details. I mostly wanted to know if it was autoimmune and if I should get thyroid antibodies tested because I know some auto-immune issues can be genetic. Turns out she has hypothyroidism that is not autoimmune in nature but rather caused by pituitary gland dysfunction. Apparently, my bio grandma (her mom) also has pituitary dysfunction which causes her to develop benign tumors all over her body (arms, legs, breasts, neck, and so on). When I asked what kind of tumors, she said calcium so Im guessing they are like calcium deposits that develop randomly. When if they knew what caused the dysfunction, she claims it is caused by the fact they both have deadly iodine allergies.\n\nThis is where the mystery is. I know iodine can impact pituitary function, which can impact thyroid function but, from my preliminary research, it seems like **excessive** iodine consumption would cause hypothyroidism, not lack of iodine like in my bio moms case (she says she cant even eat eggs any more because they started causing anaphylaxis). Is this true?\n\nIn the case of my bio grandma, I couldnt find anything about pituitary gland dysfunction causing calcium tumors/deposits in the body. Is this a real thing or is it even possible?\n\nTo top it off, from what Ive read, iodine isnt even a real allergen. I know its needed for survival, so that would make sense, but my bio mom insists its an iodine allergy. I honestly dont even know what to say about this.\n\nAll in all, Im completely stumped. Im a first-year pre-med student, so this is all super interesting but also mind-boggling to me. My bio mom is also a medically-minded person, having completed medical school, which makes this whole situation even weirder to me. I understand if this is not the place to ask, but I dont know where else to go. I figured even if this isn't welcome here, someone might know where I could post it. Otherwise, I would love some insight on any part of this situation.\n\nFor anyone who wants even more information, lol, our family history is super weird in general. We have four generations of colon cancer with my bio mom being the youngest diagnosed at 32. We also have 3 generations of uterine cancer. When my brain tumor was biopsied I was tested for classic cancer syndromes and no cancer syndrome mutations were detected. No one had their tumors tested besides me, so who knows. We also have an undiagnosed bleeding/bruising disorder. Both my bio mom and her sister almost died in childbirth due to hemorrhaging. I myself have a predisposition to scarring and deal with slow wound healing.\n\nIf you made it this far, I cannot thank you enough."""

Im M,24 but after a day of work i would collaps on the couch before dinner and basically only sleep. In the weekends i had to sleep 11-12 hours just to recuperate. Therefore i basically had no energy for anything other than work and sleep which i was getting really tired of. Important to note is that i dont often have stomach pain and normal stool.\n\nAnyway, I went and got celiac tests done and those were surprisingly postive! Anti-TTG was 83.0 ku/l (normal is < 7.0), anti-gliadin was 56.0 (normal <7.0) and anti-EMA was positive. (also positive for HLA DQ2.5)\n\nHereafter i went and got biopsies with my gastroenterologist but since those were negative he couldnt give me the official diagnosis. He told me that in children they are starting to give the diagnosis without biopsies but that isnt the case yet in adults. Of note is that these biopsies were performed under a normal, gluten-containing diet for 6 weeks which made my symptoms notably worse after i had gone glutenfree for 4 weeks before this. \n\nMy question: Even though my biopsies were negative the chance of me not having celiac with these blood values is basically 0 right? I read some literature on test specifics and they said that specifically enti-EMA is basically 99%+ specific?\n\nI ask now since i am with an internal medicine specialist now to exclude other medical reasons for my symptoms. He suggested that if he doesnt find anything we can re-do the biopsy in hope that they now are positive since celiacs explains my symptoms quite well. Im hestiant about this because of the fact that i was way worse on the gluten diet and that there is no guaratee that the biopsies will now turn up positive. And since an actual diagnosis doesnt have any real implications (still just have to eat glutenfree), im debating wether or not this is necessary.\n\nBasically, i we cannot find any other medical problems i can just assume that i have celiac's disease correct?\n\nThanks in advance!"""

No issues with blood pressure or diabetes but it's been many years since I have seen a doctor (no health insurance) so perhaps that has changed. \n\nA few weeks ago I was at my mother's for dinner so I had not eaten all day.

I went to stand up and my right leg was the same way. I flopped back down and had my mother bring me something to eat. She brought me a bag of very salty corn tortilla chips. I really struggled just to open the bag and had to eat them left handed because just getting a chip to my mouth with the right was difficult. By the time I finished eating the third chip, it had gone away and I was perfectly fine. I figured it was just from not eating all day and forgot about it.\n\nUnfortunately since then, it has happened two more times. First about a week later and this time it was bad. I really struggled just trying to walk to the kitchen to get that same bag of chips (I took them home with me). Once again, by the time I ate three, I was perfectly fine. And then it just now happened again though this time, I got up the moment I noticed something off and again, three chips and I was good.

I am 19M, 160 LBS 5 foot 10 inches.  I am deaf in my left ear (since I was a toddler). \n\nIt all started around 2 years ago, I had dizzy spells off and on.  They would happen for a few days straight and then not happen for around 3-6 months.  I also had hearing problems in my right ear in November of 2022, I had severe tinnitus.  I could barely hear.  \n\nWell, recently Ive had more medical problems.  I tried to go to bed one night and I couldnt.  It felt like my body was shocking me awake every time I would close my eyes and relax.  It started on the left back corner of my head and went down my spine.  I have however had hypersensitivity in that spot on my head before and sometimes on other parts of my body, but it didnt happen nearly as much.  It felt like I was just being tickled awake.  Sometimes, it caused me to physically jump (guess my reflexes are good huh).\n\nNow, Im having discomfort on the left upper side of my face.  It feels like my face is sticky.  Its not necessarily numb, but it feels off.  In addition, it also feels like theres something in my left eye.  It almost always feel like I have hair in the left side of my face.  \n\nI tried going to the doctor, they did nothing.  They referred me to a rheumatologist, a General Care doctor, and a ENT before deciding to send me to neurology.  I wasnt sleeping well, so I took time off of work while I deal with this, and lost my job when I got to the end of my allowed time off.  Now, I have a vein that seems to be popping out on my left temple, near where I feel off on my face.\n\nI feel like Im gonna die.  I have Anxiety, Depression, and i have really bad health anxiety.  Any advice is really helpful.  I dont know what to do.  They say that the symptoms of a brain tumor will not go away, come back and go away again, so I feel like the dizziness is a separate issue at this point because I havent been dizzy for almost 6 months now.  If anyone can give me things I could suggest to my doctor when I next see him to test for, advice, or if Im crazy and its not a tumor please tell me.  Thank You!'"

The symptoms include a dry cough, dry heaving, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, and feeling lightheaded and weak. I told the PA about the medications Im on, which are metformin 1000mg a day and Wellbutrin (cant remember the dose, but its low and only taken once a day), and she told me almost immediately that I have been experiencing major side effects of the metformin and recommended to me to lower the dose to 500mg a day or stop taking it all together. She also wants me to follow up with my PCP, who I will call on Monday to schedule an appointment. I have been on the metformin since late April and the only side effect I ever experienced was heartburn and that went away after the first two weeks.\n\nI also had to stop taking Latuda 80mg in March because I was vomiting after every dose. I was actually vomiting so hard that my face looked like red and splotchy for days and my eyes were blood shot. I told the nurse at my psychs office and they told me to stop taking the medication immediately. I had been on Latuda for two years and was on the 80mg for 6 months. The only side effect I had ever experienced was weight gain.\n\nI just got prescribed a new antipsychotic and I am terrified of taking it. I have never had any severe side effects to medications before and it all just started happening in the last three months. Its like my body cant tolerate medication? Can anyone explain why this might be happening? \n\nTo note; I am consistent with my medications. I take them the same time every day and with meals. I dont skip any doses and have alarms set on my phone to remind me to take them. I drink 7-8 bottled waters a day and I cut out all caffeine and soda since I work in a warehouse, to prevent dehydration. I also dont read side effects of my medications, my mom used to tell me I was a hypochondriac in my school age years and because of that I became paranoid that any medical problem I may have is all in my head. I was diagnosed with pseudo seizures two years ago and that honestly made it worse, so I try not to go to the doctor for anything.'"

But in short, I was put on medications for schizoaffective disorder because I told my school that my sister molested me. My parents instantly jumped to the conclusion that I had to have been delusional for thinking that my sister could\'ve ever done something like that, and told my psychiatrist to put me on meds for schizoaffective/schizophrenia disorder. He committed heavy malpractice and for the longest time didn\'t even tell me what I was diagnosed with, didn\'t even tell me the side effects of the medication, or the name of it.\n\nLong story short, three years later I am on new medications. I was involuntarily sent to a psych ward for trying to file a police report. It was living hell, where no one listened to me or cared for me, and the doctor told me I would be out of there sooner if I started taking injected palipiderone. Then he told me that my stay would be extended. The people in the ward told me that I was delusional and refused to even look at the evidence I had on my phone of my sister literally admitting to a lot of it. I was actually supposed to see a lawyer the day after I was hospitalized. Then he told me that no time would\'ve changed regardless of what meds I took. I heard a lot of stories from other people in the ward about how he did things similar to this and always acted erratic like that. The new meds are horrible, and my new doctor likely will not listen to me if I tell him to take them off. I cannot tell my parents to change the doctor, they are extremely neglectful and will not listen to me. Their only instinct is ""listen to the doctor"" but he never listens to me or believes what I have to say.\n\nI am just wondering if I can just not give my consent to see this doctor without being threatened reasonably by hospitalization, and more importantly can I ask that he taper me off of them?

However, leading up to the appointment I have seen my gastroenterologist, cardiologist and primary doctor, and all of them have overlooked it.

Im already a normal weight and I think I eat pretty healthy so I dont know what else I could do. \n\nIve looked up symptoms of diabetes, and while I do have some symptoms, they can also be attributed to my other medical problems. The main ones (thirsty, frequent urinating, weight loss) I dont seem to have. \n\nAlso I want to note that 6 months earlier my glucose was also high at 120. The rheumatologist didnt say anything about it then either.\n\nAlso not sure if it matters but the other labs that were abnormal were high white blood cells, high absolute neutrophils, low absolute monocytes, low abs. Eosinophils, low abs. Lymphocytes, high sedimentation rate, and high C-reactive protein. Only my gastroenterologist has commented on these but always says its probably my colitis. They never used to be abnormal though, and Ive had colitis for years.

Within a few months the pain spread to my elbows, ankles, hips, fingers and wrists. A year later the pain was in nearly every joint, accept for a few knuckles. The pain is typically fine, but if I try to exercise even lightly, it worsens to the point where I cannot sleep or walk properly. It feels like liquid fire is being injected into my joints. My left shoulder in particular gets so bad that I have to hold it up with my other arm, because the weight of it hanging from my shoulder causes unbearable pain. The pain is worse at night and minimal in the morning.\n\nAround the same time my friends and family began to point out that my entire body, but mainly hands, legs, and face looked puffy.

At fifteen I started having nose bleeds that were so heavy the blood would back up my nose and come out my mouth, leaving me unable to breathe. This lasted two years before I sought medical help. They inserted a camera up my nose to locate the bleed and couldn't see anything. The bleeding stopped soon after. At eighteen I started to get a mottled red rash along the inside of my thighs, knees, ankles and the tops of my feet. It only appears when I shower or bathe. I've been getting atleast eight hours of sleep every night, but still would fall asleep in class and now can't function properly at work and am so tired sometimes I want to die.\n\nI went to a doctor three years ago and he said my skin is hyperelastic? and that my muscles are weaker than they should be.

What I mean by that is, it feels like my throat is constricted and like there\'s a weight on my chest/breastbone. The more air I breathe in the worse it hurts. Physically can\'t take a deep breath because it hurts too much. Even shallow breaths are uncomfortable. This usually lasts a few days. Nothing helps. Can\'t do breathing exercises to reduce anxiety because it hurts. Exerting myself at all makes it hurt more, like even picking up my child or walking across the house. \n\nI have gone to the doctor a couple times and they have just said ""oh I think you\'re getting a cold"" but my lungs always sound clear/throat looks normal. They gave me an Albuterol nebulizer once? And it didn\'t make any difference. I\'ve taken ibuprofen before when this happens but it makes no difference, thinking maybe it\'s an inflammation thing. \n\nI\'ve taken antianxiety meds a couple times to try to reduce my overall anxiety (not specifically for these episodes) and hated the way I felt- I just literally didn\'t care about anything. \n\nIs there anything else I can do? Just ride it out? Is there anything to make this awful constricted breathing feeling go away? Is this ""normal"" for anxiety? With three small children to take care of it makes my life extremely difficult.'"

After the wonderful doctor I had for years retired I finally found a new one who I really liked and who seemed to really want to help me figure out my issues. I have severe chronic pain and a very bad tremor. Its making it almost impossible to do my job. I also see a neurologist who is pretty worthless in my opinion. Ive been taking Gabenpentin and 2mg Lorazapam for my tremors, pain and anxiety. I only take the Lorazapam/Ativan as needed. It helps tremendously sometimes and Ive had the prescription for years now. So, I had an appt. with the new doctor who suddenly and unexpectedly resigned right before my appointment in October 2022. She sent out a letter recommending a doctor in the same practice and said she will continue to prescribe meds for 3 months. So I called and scheduled the initial appt. with the recommended doctor for January,20,2023right at the 3 month mark. The morning of Jan.20, the office calls and said the new doctor had to cancel. I was all dressed and ready to go. So I reschedule, the next available time she has is in JULY!!! 6 months after the appointment they cancelled on me!! Now they are saying they wont refill my prescriptions for the Lorazapam/Ativan or any of my other meds until I see her!! That means I will abruptly be without any of my medications Ive been taking for years for 6 whole months! Through no fault of my own. I keep calling every week to see if there is a cancellation and if they can squeeze me in. Is there any advice or tips on what I can do? Seems dangerous and cruel to deny people their medication when its the doctor who cancelled the appointment and rescheduled so far out. Im in the USA if that matters.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/127kmql/i_used_to_be_partially_blind_on_one_eye_what/,"b'I used to be partially blind on one eye, what happened?'","b'I\'m currently 24M from EU Croatia, but this happened few years back when I was around 20. I\'m 180 cm in height and around 70 kilograms in weight, white guy. I\'m constantly wearing -8 diopter glasses and have no other medical problems.\n\nFirst time I noticed it (or at least what my memory is trying to make sense) was in a bar where prior to arriving there, I accidentally got ""sun blinded"" when I lifted my head up which appeared like a dark or empty spot in my vision that usually goes away in minutes. Nothing special, I talked to a friend how bad it was because it stayed there quite a while. When I came back home, it was still there, or something that looked like that. It didn\'t look exactly like that temporary sun blindness, but more of like grey freckles that covered good chunk of my vision in one eye. Whenever I would to to sleep, I\'d test my eyes by closing one and opening the other to compare the sight, and that one eye was a lot darker than the healthy one in a dark room. If I\'d look at a window from which bits of street lights would reach my room, I would see dark spots where the window should be illuminated. I think I\'ve waited one day before telling my parents what\'s up and we immediately started planning a visit to a doctor. Meanwhile, it seemed like the partial blindness was getting worse and worse, more and more of my vision on that eye got shrouded by ""grey opaque freckles"" and it was really frustrating reading and watching text, images, faraway objects and such.\n\nAs the weeks turned to months, I have made many tests and medical examinations such as (I\'ll try to explain them as detailed as I can because I currently don\'t know where my medical papers are and I\'m not an expert in this) typical eye examination where the specialist would sit across a magnifier and I\'d look at some tiny image; the brain scan with spinning electromagnet thing (MRI scan myb); weird box where I\'d sit my head, focus on the target in front of my face and try to spot highlights in periphery of my vision; weird taped electrodes all over my head and watched at some weird chess-like patterns in a dark room (I\'m not sure if I skipped any more, but most of them are here). And best part is, all of the tests came out to be in order and nothing unusual was detected. A perfectly healthy medical picture. Yet my eye was still partially blinded. All of the specialists and doctors had no idea what to make out of that, but most common assumption was heavy mental stress. At the time I had severe waves of depression (even tho I haven\'t tested for it), suicidal thoughts, friendship and family turmoil, you know, a typical late teen/young adult brainstorms and existential crisis. They\'re mostly gone now and I feel like a happy and outgoing individual. Mom talked about my papers and my testimony to her friend that is a specialist from another town and she concluded roughly the same theory but she feared it would be permanent and would get even worse. But as I already spoiled it in the title, I fully recovered from the partial blindness that lasted about 4-5 months. One night I just went on to test my eyes in the dark like I explained before, but this time, I perfectly saw the light from the window. Next few days I was testing it on pictures and texts, and I no longer saw weird grey freckles. It was huge relief, but it was so mysterious and enigmatic to say the least. One doctor said it would be permanent, other\'s said it is genetic, stress, injury etc. It was like a spiritual experience.\n\nMy personal theory on this varies, from severe sun blindness and stress, to weird ones such as extensive usage of computers with bright monitors and ""one-eye peeking"" on my phone before and after sleep (I commonly lay on one side and watch the mobile phone with one eye, or interchange it as I change sides). But I\'ve been looking at bright screens before that and long after that. Even now I\'m practicing it as I\'m writing it, and nothing happens.\n\nIt was a really weird condition I had to say the least.'"

I was constantly anxious and OCD, and Lexapro wasn\'t helping at all. I probably had built up a very strong tolerance to it.\n2. My APRN prescriber (not my primary care doctor or a psychiatrist) was a hassle to deal with and not a very nice person. She was a good person to deal with at first, but later on became less interested in me, and seemed indifferent to my declining mental state. She also upped my dosage of Lexapro to 30mg over time, for reasons I cannot remember. In 2020, just before the cold turkey, I had suggested to her that I possibly switch to another medication, as I thought Lexapro wasn\'t working anymore, and she refused to change me to something else.\n3. The APRN moved to Texas in 2015. She never suggested seeing somebody locally after they moved. They are not licensed in Texas,only RI, CT, and WA. Texas law says they need to work with a physician to practice psych med management,but they are not licensed in Texas,they only live there, so I\'m not sure legally what they are required to do. I live in Rhode Island, and I could only get a refill through telehealth webcam visits, and my webcam didn\'t work for the session in June, meaning they refused to give me a refill, and didn\'t suggest other ways to get one.\n\nI started taking over the counter 5-HTP as a replacement for the Lexapro, but it had no effect either. Nothing was helping my anxiety at all last year. It came to a head in late September 2020, after being at the ER for an intense panic attack that spanned 3 days,until I was able to cool down at the ER. A mental health social worker had been to my house during the breakdown, but referred me to a mental health facility that wasn\'t taking any new patients, rendering that service useless, in a time when I was having an intense breakdown of emotions. The last time this had happened was in 2012, which led to my OCD/Anxiety diagnosis.\n\nI re-contacted the APRN, as they were a person who knew my case, as I had seen them for 6 years by then, and were able to see me very soon after this breakdown, and she put back on Lexapro, but at a 10mg dosage this time, instead of 30mg. They didn\'t seem concerned about me quitting 30mg cold turkey, the fact that I had quit in general so harshly, the fact that EMTs/Police had been to the house because of my breakdown, no real concern. She also did not want me to run any health tests before putting me back on medication, nor did she ask if I was taking any supplements or other medications.\n\nAbout 2 to 3 weeks into this reinstatement, I remember feeling a very heavy, dull, numb-like feeling in my head that built up over a few days, mainly at the top of my head, but it felt like it was inside my brain too. I began having jaw stiffness during the day (Not really bruxism, because it wasn\'t clenching, my jaw would just sort of jut out unconsciously), and then I started getting acute and severe health symptoms one on top of another. I had to stop taking Lexapro again due to these problems, as I thought at the time the reinstatement was causing this. I have not been on Lexapro, or any psych med in general, since mid-October 2020. The symptoms I can recall having occur suddenly from mid October 2020 to now are;\n\n1. Brain fog\n2. Memory loss\n3. Throbbing headaches\n4. Muscle twitching (Used to be very intense, mainly in my legs and stomach, but now it\'s small little twitching in my hands, face, and feet, sometimes)\n5. Bad cough\n6. Dry mouth (Only in times when I was anxious, though)\n7. Extremely dry, throbbing lips (Not sure if anxiety caused this, but for about 4 days my lips were in intense pain while that happened),\n8. Extreme fatigue\n9. Watery mucus\n10. Dry sinuses\n11. Nerve and muscle problems (Mainly in the left side of my face, neck, chest, genitals, and seldom in my left foot, in the sole area. My neck feels painful and stiff a lot on the left side, I would get quick, almost zap-like chest pains on both sides of my chest a few months ago, but now it\'s only on the left side, my face on the left side will sometimes feel tingly, burning, or weak, or numb, my genitals only hurt in the left testicle and on the left side of my penis when I move it a certain way. The right side of my leg feels weak at times too. My left foot would have a burning feeling sometimes)\n12. An intense bout of facial warmness (One day my entire face felt like it was on fire, I had an ice pack on it all night)\n13. Ear ringing (Either side multiple times a day)\n14. Nausea\n15. Pale lips\n16. An iron deficiency\n17. Numb emotions and numb libido\n18. Breathing problems (Sometimes I have to manually breathe instead of automatically, and my breathing can get labored and shallow)\n19. Blood in my mucus/phlegm\n\nSome of these symptoms have improved (Ear ringing is basically gone now, sometimes happens but not as badly, same with the bad cough), and some haven\'t (Brain fog, memory loss, numb emotions/libido, and nerve/muscle problems are a constant that rarely improves).\n\nOver a year later, I am still not really sure what caused this. Some have suggested it is long COVID, some have said that the Lexapro reinstatement might have caused a ""kindling"" adverse effect in my brain/nervous system, similar to neurotoxicity, since I had gone off 30mg cold turkey which made my brain over-sensitive to the medication the second time around, and some suggest it\'s intense stress.It could be a mix of things.\n\nMy brain CT scan in January 2021, about 3 months after this started, said ""There is mild volume loss for age, more so on the right. There may be a small area of anterolateral right frontal encephalomalacia."" and ""Mucosal thickening is seen inferiorly in the right frontal sinus as well as throughout right ethmoid air cells. The right sphenoid sinus is partially opacified. Mild mucosal thickening is seen in the left sphenoid sinus."". Everything else in the CT scan was normal.\n\nMy first brain MRI, done in February 2021, said ""Partially empty sella turcica with mild CSF prominence at the optic nerves bilaterally, can be seen in the setting of idiopathic intracranial hypertension."" and besides that, was normal. No mention of encephalomalacia, sinus issues, or volume loss whatsoever.\n\nMy second brain MRI, done in November 2021, said the same as the MRI above, but now also said ""Scattered FLAIR hyperintensities nonspecific but most commonly related to chronic microvascular changes."". Again, no mention of encephalomalacia, sinus issues, or volume loss whatsoever.\n\nX-rays done by a chiropractor of my lower back and neck done in November 2021 show a tilted pelvis, and issues with the vertebraein my neck. Can\'t remember specifics, need to find the results they mailed me again.\n\nA CT scan of my sinuses in October 2021 by an ENT doctor showed this.\n\n>FINDINGS:  \n>  \n>Frontal:  Moderate mucosal thickening in caudal right frontal sinus. Clear left frontal sinus.  \n>  \n>Ethmoid:  Mild mucosal thickening throughout right ethmoid air cells. Minor posterior left ethmoid mucosal thickening.  \n>  \n>Maxillary:  Tiny retention cyst along floor of right maxillary sinus with additional tiny focus anteromedially. Clear left maxillary sinus. Clear ostiomeatal units.  \n>  \n>Sphenoid:  Moderate mucosal thickening bilaterally, more so inferiorly.  \n>  \n>Nasal cavity:  Mild nasal septal deviation to the right superiorly with slight deviation to the left inferiorly.  \n>  \n>Tympanomastoid:  Clear. Narrowed porus acusticus bilaterally, more so on the left. Osseous thinning along superior margin of both superior semicircular canals.  \n>  \n>Orbits: Unremarkable.  \n>  \n>Intracranial: Grossly unremarkable.  \n>  \n>IMPRESSION:  \n>  \n>Diffuse overall mild paranasal sinus disease.\n\nMy blood work has also been consistently been somewhat off, with high platelet levels, anisocytosis, low MCH, high WBC levels, high RBC, high monocytes count, high neutrophils count, high lymphocytes count, high atypical lymphocytes, high ANC, high RDW-CV, high glucose, and low iron levels showing up repeatedly in blood work done from November 2020 to October 2021. I also have giant platelets.\n\nI am wondering if the people on here can offer any advice. It\'s been awful at times dealing with these issues, and not knowing why it happened, and why it\'s not going fully away, for over a year, is so frustrating.

My pregnancy was fairly unremarkable. I took prenatals throughout, unisom, as directed, nightly.  While I was pregnant with her, I had access to her ultrasound reports. I noticed her measurements were small and asked my doctor, as I was concerned for growth restriction. My doctor reassured me that she was just small, but not abnormally so. Small people make small babies she said. I am shorter, but nothing crazy. 53 and 127 at conception, but put on 50lbs during pregnancy. My husband is quite thin, but very tall 63 165lbs. \n\n After my third trimester the ultrasound the tech slipped and said commented on how small she was, so I pushed again with a different doctor for that appointment about size and again was reassured she was small, but not at a concerning level. I opted for elective induction at 39 weeks and learned upon birthing her that she was in fact too small. She didnt require NICU and we were discharged on time. She needed one glucose tab for low blood sugar but her levels were normal after that. I was pretty hysterical immediately postpartum, but everyone kept telling me that because she was proportionally small, all was well. Shes 8 weeks now and grown from the 1% to the 3rd.  Ive asked the same questions in different ways, but I cant feel reassured after what happened with her birth. \n\nCan someone help me understand why I shouldnt be concerned with what Im reading about developmental and other medical problems for SGA children.

I\'m often forgetting what I am doing or trying to say.\nExtreme fatigue - sometimes unable to stay awake for over 4-6 hrs if active (or have been active recently, e.g. a day or two ago.)\nSleep issues - often sleeping over 12+ hours, but it is hard to initially fall asleep even though I\'m exhausted often\nMuscle weakness\nGeneral joint/muscle stiffness - likely because I am not very active right now\nPossibly had a seizure recently? - Was unable to confirm at a hospital at the time. However, friends with me witnessed it.\n\n-\n\nIt started out as just intermittent nausea and vomiting and although that was annoying it wasn\'t the end of the world. It happened maybe once time a month to begin with.\nIt steadily began to get worse though and was beginning to interfere with my job, as it was happening 2-3 times a month a couple times a day during the days I got ill. \nI was a compounding pharmacy technician with a private infusion pharmacy. Becoming ill in the clean room is definitely not an option so I began seeking out medical help.\nInitially I visited my pcp and they gave me some Zofran and told me to take it easy bit it was likely anxiety or something of the like but nothing to worry about. Relieved I went back to work but eventually got ill again. I attempted to use the Zofran but it didn\'t really help any. I returned to the doctor who referred me to a GI specialist. While waiting for that appointment I also began to have diarrhea on a regular basis, whether I was vomiting that day or not, typically several times a week. The vomiting and nausea also began to get worse, and I began to throw up small amount of bright red blood (Maybe 3-5mls at a time). I figured it was probably an ulcer once that happened but went to an er to get it checked out. The er did some blood work and some a CT with contrast. I wasn\'t bleeding out so they sent me home and told me to f/u with my pcp.\nFast forward to the GI appointment and the doctor recommended an ultrasound of my abdomen. Once I got that done they said I had gallstones and they believed that was what was causing me trouble. GI doc then recommended I have my gallbladder removed.\nSo I had the surgery done in January of 2021, and was very careful with what I ate for a few weeks. It seemed thing were ok.\nA few months (aprox June of 2021) later though my symptoms started returning, but with avengence.\nI was now throwing up several times a week, and the days I was sick it was several times during the day. As well as terrible heartburn. I also developed the weirdest rashes on my forearms. \nI went to a clinic to get the rashes looked at and got some steroid cream that didn\'t help at all. I went to my pcp and they gave me oral antibiotics but it took almost 2 weeks for them to heal...Probably partially because I was having a hard time keeping the antibiotics down. My pcp prescribed promethazine to help me keep the antibiotics down, but it would knock me out all day so I often couldn\'t take it. \nAlso developed two nasty cold sores in that time period that wouldn\'t go away even though I was using camphor on them. It took about a month before they cleared up.\n\nWent back to the gi doc and let him know that nothing had gotten better if anything it had gotten worse. They decide to order an upper scope, which I had done around September  2021.\nThe upper scope only showed inflammation of the stomach and a 3cm hital hernia. According to the doctor none of that showed anything of concern or anything that could pinpoint what was wrong. Just evidence of my symptoms. The gi doc said that there was nothing else to be done and that happens to some people sometimes and that the best term he had for it cyclic vomiting. He sent me on my way and more or less said good luck.\n\nI decided to tough it out and just try and push thru the bad days. Often doing my best to hide when I was ill as much as possible, but I was losing physical strength and started having really bad brain fog.\nI began getting so ill all I could safely eat was baby food food I would often throw up without having eaten and it would just be acid/bile.\nI\'m also on psych medication (primarily the important one for me to take is my lithium) and began being unable to keep it down. My pcp prescribed carafate to help me try to keep my psych meds down but failed to tell me I had to space out when I took it in relation to my other meds and some how it was not on the prescription bottle either...\nNeedless to say after much struggle, a few more er trips due to the vomiting, and what felt at the time was sabotage... I ended up in a psych ward in January of 2022. The psych ward documented my struggles as I was throwing up there too. They mostly gave me protein shakes, which seemed to help.\n\nOnce I got out a week later I got a new pcp and gi doc who would do a gastric emptying test, barium test and colonoscopy. \n(I almost threw up several times during the barium test.) They all came back unremarkable however. \n\nIn the mean time between tests I ended up in the er in May of 2022 due to throwing up every 30-45 mins in a 12 hour period. They gave me some lactatid ringers and iv anti nausea meds then sent me on my way once I stopped throwing up.\nMy new pcp gave me promethegan (the suppository of promethazine) and nexium after that, which helps. Although the promethegan will keep me drowsy for about 2 days so I more or less can\'t do anything on it.\n\nOnce I got to July of 2022 I contracted Covid and after that I wasn\'t able to even pretend to be functional at work. Everything got so much worse after that. I was sick all the time, weak and my brain fog was really inhibiting me. By August of 2022 I took short term disability at work. \nMy final test, the colonoscopy was done in November of 2022. Which was unremarkable as I said and I was let go from my job in November as well.\nBetween November and now my symptoms have been a little more manageable but I think that\'s mostly because I sleep all the time and don\'t do much. When I am active it starts to act up more. \nFor example around Christmas I spent time with my family for about 5 days and had to constantly take aprox 3-4 hour naps even though I was sleeping around 10-12 hours a night. I ended up ill 2 of those 5 days as well.\nWhich normally if I just stay at home and don\'t push myself I can usually go about 2 weeks without being ill as long as I take my meds and rest.\n\n-\n\nNow to the even MORE bizarre thing.\nThe past two weeks I had been a lot more dizzy than normal. \nThen last Sunday, January 15th, I passed out and reportedly had a seizure according to the people I was with.\n\nI was at home watching Netflix with a couple friends and I got very dizzy, my hearing was a little off, my heartbeat started to get a little fast, I recognized didn\'t feel well and then I passed out. I don\'t remember it very well but between me and my friends these were the symptoms I exhibted after I had passed out and seized:\n\nIncoherent \nConfused \nUnable to focus\nMemory problems/lapses\nVery tired\nClammy\nFelt very cold, even to the touch - No fever, temp of 97.9 \nSweating profusely \nVery pale\nNumbness/tingling in arms/hands - it felt like they had fallen asleep\nVision abnormalities - grey splotches in my vision\nUnable to walk/weak\nMuscle tremors in hands\n\n\nMy friends stated I passed out in the chair I was sitting in and began to seize for aprox 1 minute then slumped down in the chair. They then managed to rouse me and get me to speak but I wasn\'t making any sense. Then they got me to sit up. I vaguely remember them talking to me and asking me questions. I felt very, very cold and was covered in sweat, but my temp was normal. They got me a Gatorade and a small bite to eat which that helped. It took me about an hour to come back around and be totally coherent again.\n\nMy brain fog and fatigue has been measurably worse since then, and I slept a ton for the two days after it happened. I basically didn\'t do anything but sleep.\n\nOne of my friends was concerned that my blood sugar bottomed out but I didn\'t have a glucometer at the time to check, but one of my friends got me one and I\'ve been checking it 3x a day since then and my average is 100 points, so I don\'t really think that\'s what happened.\n\nI probably should of went to the er when it happened but I was apparently very combative to the idea at the time. I don\'t have any money anymore and I lost my insurance, so I couldn\'t of afforded that and I\'m sure that\'s probably what I was thinking at the time.\nI went to a clinic for the uninsured this past Thursday to get checked out though, and all they did was run some labs (Doc said mostly to check my thyroid and for diabetes). They said since I was functioning, moving around and it hadn\'t happened again I was probably fine and sent me on my way. I did explain to them I have been having medical problems before this as well.\nI get I couldn\'t expect much for a few reasons but damn does it make me nervous...\n\nI know I wrote a small novel but I felt all these pieces mattered to paint the appropriate picture of what I\'ve been going thru. \nPlease if anyone has any advice or ideas for me to work off of PLEASE let me know. I feel like my whole life has been stolen from me and I don\'t even have a path to TRY to make it better much less any kind of solution. I\'m at my wits end. Please help me if you can...\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this.'"

Don\'t smoke or drink. No serious drugs, minor casual cannibis in 30s.  BMI is 25. Modest regular exercise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nAround early 2000s - my early to mid 40s - I had minor diarrhea and constipation.\n\nI saw gastroenterologist around 2001 or 2002.  He said ""...nothing serious...eating too much junk food...eat more fiber""\n\nI took his advice.  Digestive symptoms decreased for a while, then increased during 2009, 2010.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCRISIS:\n\nSuddenly, in Nov 2011 - at age 53 - I started experiencing\n\n\\* Headches, centered around right eye\n\n\\* Extreme fatigue\n\n\\* Vision loss - scotomas in right eye\n\n\\* Sensitivity to heat and light.\n\n\\* Parasthesia of hands and feet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nATTEMPTS AT DIAGNOSIS:\n\nIt took many months to get things sorted out\n\nOne doc assumed heart attack.  I had electrocardiogram, it showed that my heart was okay.  Was tested for diabetes.  That was negative.  Saw eye doc at Koch Eye Center. Extensive tests showed that right eyeball was okay.\n\nNo progress was being made.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was living in Northeastern LA county at the time, so I transferred to UCLA.  ( I figured  that I would get the best rated medical care on this side of the Mississippi, even if it meant two hours of LA traffic each way. Sometimes my wife would drive me. )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUCLA docs decided that it was a neurological problem.\n\nHad VEP ( visual evoked potental ) test, showed substantial damage to right optic nerves.  Based upon VEP results, was given diagnosis of MS by UCLA neurologist.\n\nBut two MRIs showed no lesions in brain or spinal cord.\n\nNeurologist still maintained that I had MS, but that the lesions hadn\'t shown up yet.  Second neurologist - also UCLA - agreed.   Apparently my VEP results and parasthesia were a textbook presentation of MS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n( At this point - about mid 2013, almost two years after onset of neuro symptoms - the scotomas had subsided, but I was still experiencing headaches, fatigue, parasthesia, and sensitivity to heat and light; plus continuing gastointestinal problems. )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut, given the negative MRIs, the docs were amenable to listening to alternatives.\n\nI suggested gastro problems as the cause.   Was checked for diverticulitis, tested negative.  Was tested for celiac, tested negative.  Had camera endoscopy, showed lymphangiectasia.\n\nBut they could make no connection between the lymphangiectasia and the neurological symptoms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the nurses in UCLA gastro office quietly suggested checking for food allergies.  The docs would not approve a skin prick test.\n\nI started a FODMAP diet, and gastroinestinal symptoms decreased greatly.   I finally realized that I was reacting to gluten, despite what celiac test said.   I started testing myself for food allergies by trial and error.  This showed a handful of foods to which I had allergies or intolerances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTENTATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nAt this point, food allergies led me to think that there might be an inherited genetic component to it.\n\nIn her 40s and onward, my mother had parasthesias, heat and light intolerance, and food allergies.  She had eventually died at age 73 from myleodisplasia.\n\nI realized - with the discovery of food allergies - that my medical profile was beginning to look like my mother\'s.  I didn\'t like the trend, since the last thing on her chart was fatal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I looked up differential diagnosis of myleodisplasia.  The primary DD is copper deficiency.  I looked through my mother\'s records, found that nobody had ever checked her copper levels.   ( Yes, my mother may have died in a modern hosital from an easily treatable digestive deficiency.  But that is water under the bridge. Can\'t bring her back. )\n\nArmed with this, I went to my doc, asked for a copper test.  She told me that it was not necessary, that nobody has copper deficiencies.\n\nI insisted.  So I got the test.  It was positive.  I was copper deficient.  Doc then said take 2.5 mg copper supplements, for thirty days, then we will test again.  I took them as advised, went back for the second test.  It was still low. So she doubled it to 5mg every day.  Another thirty days later, a third test showed copper levels just barely inside the low end of normal.\n\nCopper deficiency, as some here may know, causes nerve damage similar to MS.  So we had a tentative diagnosis.  ( The neurologist at UCLA had no comment )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSTASIS:\n\nThus, around 2014, we had reached a stable situation:\n\nI was taking copper supplements, eating carefully to avoid allergies/intolerances.  Digestive symptoms were slowly getting better over the years.  Neuro symptoms were not.\n\nMy vision was mostly healed ( except for reds - all shades of red looked the same )\n\nI was stuck with a permanent set of symptoms of nerve damage: heat intolerance ( anything above 75F left me fatigued and stumbling like a drunk ), light intolerance, parasthesia, daily headaches.\n\nDocs had told me that nerve damage was irrepairable and permanent.\n\nThey gave me Modfinil and Armodafinil to maintain alertness, and a disabled parking permit so that I could avoid heat in parking lots.\n\nI had the air conditioning on almost all the time, both house and car.  I kept the windows closed and the shades down all the time.  If I went out, it was usually at night, or at least near dusk.\n\nI lived like a vampire.\n\nCold, cloudy days were a temporary reprieve. I seriously considered moving to Seattle just for the weather.\n\nThat was my life for years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHE TWIST:\n\nIn addition to the medical problems above, in 2022 I had begun to observe that I was losing muscle mass as I aged.  So I looked at various supplements.  Steroids all appeared dangerous.  But creatine looked safe, and cheap.\n\nI ordered a bag of it online, and began taking it, starting with 3.75 mg ( one teaspoon ) mid-morning on August 10th.  I continued with another teaspoon in the morning on the 11th.\n\nOn the evening of the 11th, I was playing my usual near-dusk game of volleyball. ( I would usually play the last game or two before dark, and thereby get some exercise. I would get fatigued and mentally fuzzy, but I could recover by sitting in the car with the AC on full blast as the sky turned dark. )\n\nBut this time I wasn\'t getting fuzzy.  Despite being warm from exercise, and being in sunlight, I was feeling okay.  I called it a fluke, and cooled off for a bit, then drove home.\n\nDriving home, the brake lights of the car in front of me looked different.  I was seeing shades of red that I had not seen in a decade. Most of the symptoms of nerve damage had just disappeared.  For that evening and part of the next day I was wondering if I had been hallucinating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is now six weeks later. I have continued with 1 teaspon of creatine daily. I have no sensitivity to light any more.  I have tried being in bright light, even with bulbs that emit lots of blue light.  It poses no problems.  Recent heat waves have given me the opportunity to be in 100F heat.  It is not a problem either, whereas 77F used to be disabling.  The daily headaches are gone, as are any parasthesias.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHE QUESTION:\n\n**What is going on here?**\n\n**I have had symptoms of nerve damage to the point of being disabled.  The damage has been verified with a VEP test.  And docs at a top notch medical establishment have diagnosed me with MS.**\n\n**Yet within 30 hours of taking modest doses of creatine, much of it disappeared. Within two weeks, virtually all symptoms have disappeared.**\n\n**Why is this happening?  And is it permanent?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEPILOG:\n\nI suppose a logical scientist would discontinue the creatine, and see if the neuro symptoms would return.  But I\'m still taking a teaspoon of creatine every day.  I\'m scared to quit.  It is just too good to be normal again.'"

From that day at noon to the next day in the afternoon, his heart rate dropped to 130, the doctors who were treating him told me that he could be there a little longer and that everything was going a little better and they already had more hope that he would recover but of course keeping the treatment.\n\nI returned home with less fear and uncertainty than I had at the beginning (as i was first told this could result in death) and went to bed. When I woke up (2 hours later) my father\'s girlfriend sent me a message telling me that he had decided to return home, I immediately went to see him and he was in his bed, He breathed heavily from time to time (the doctors say that in this sense everything is fine, that is to say that the lack of oxygen is something more mental than real), and he alternated between sitting, lying down, drinking water, breathing normally, and so on all the time.\n\nWe had a conversation as calm as possible and according to him he decided to leave the clinic just because he "" was calmer at home"".  \nI am going to be honest with my thoughts, I think my father\'s decision was premature and irrational, the doctor never told me that he was ready to leave, and the worst thing is that my father confessed to me (indirectly) that he is not sure what he is doing, he literally told me that he wants to spend 1 to 2 more days with his condition at home without treatment other than the drugs prescribed by the doctor and that if ""everything continued the same"" then he would opt to return to intensive care. He is putting his life at risk and that hurts me, I am 21 years old and I feel that he does not think about what he is doing. He has done the same with his epileptic condition by stopping the pills from time to time pretending to believe that his condition was going to disappear at some point (which obviously always went wrong).\n\nI would like to ask for a professional opinion on the matter, should I ask my father again to go back to the clinic?

I am 26, male, 5'9, 260 lbs, and Chinese. My primary complaint has been stomach issues since Feb 14th, 2023. My medical problems include obesity, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver, Autism, and anxiety. However, my type 2 diabetes is well-controlled, and I've lost 45 pounds. My medications are Metformin 1000mg x2 daily, Mounjaro 15mg once weekly, Clonidine .1 mg x four daily, Zetia 10mgx one daily, and Orap pimozide 1mg x 3 daily. I. don't drink, smoke, or use recreational drugs.\n\nThat Tuesday, I ate some fast food and felt a knot in my stomach. Then, my upper abdomen (above the navel, below the breast bone) started feeling clogged when eating greasy or fatty foods. For about 14 days, I started having a lot of trapped wind. I suffered from significant burps/belching and foul-smelling flatulence. At one point, food and water were going down less quickly (though I didn't struggle to swallow). Perhaps the most worrisome symptom was feeling bloated and gassy in my stomach and sometimes the throat after eating some of my favorite foods.  I lost about 4 pounds from stress (which I have now regained this week.)\n\nAfter two weeks or so, my symptoms have improved. While there is still some mild bloating or slight stomach discomfort after eating some foods (in today's case, sushi. Some days before, Clams, oysters, and some apple pie), my stomach seems normal after eating other foods (vegetables, soups, some meats, even white rice and eggs.) This list of food is not exhaustive. While there isn't anymore uncomfortable trapped winds, there is still some flatulence and burping. \n\nI realize that I've been on this subreddit many times, and most (if not all) of my medical fears turned out to be chronic and very treatable. I realize the odds of these symptoms being caused  by a life threatening illness is low on account of age. However, my PCP and Gastrointerologist are busy, and  latter told me to wait another 2 weeks before scheduling an appointment. \n\nWhat do you guys think could be the cause of these symptoms and should I press for an earlier appointment?"""

The main problem with me is I am convinced that I have rabies, and I have not long left.'","b'The first scenario is this. So a couple of days ago, I parked my car outside a public parking lot, and there were a lot of cars there. I accidentally parked my vehicle very close to the car next to me, and it was very hard to get in and out. I don\'t remember if I was getting out or getting into my car, but while doing that, I felt a pinprick sensation on my left foot. At first, I thought ok, don\'t panic; you might have brushed it against something else, like my car door or something else, but I remember I did not touch it on my car door; at least that is what I remember (Maybe I did, or I did not, smh). When I got home hours later, I touched my foot and noticed that a bit of part of my skin was peeled off, and boom, there I was; my mind went straight to rabies; there is only a discoloration in that area, maybe the bite happened close to that area, I don\'t know, but I don\'t see any bites, or holes or anything like it, I see some ""pinpricks, that I think are pinpricks, maybe they are, maybe they are not (if you have a picture of a pinprick bite or pinpricks, please show me if you can, or if you have a bat bite picture because, on google, there is no good one). Still, I don\'t know if they are legit pinpricks or if my skin made them because of something else; it does not hurt when I touch or feel it. Still, bat bites cannot be noticeable to the naked eye, which scares me even more, but it does not hurt when I touch it. The spot is still there, but I don\'t think it has anything to do with it; the location that happened is close to that area, but maybe it is on another part that I did not see. What scares me the most about bat bites; you might get bit without noticing where you got bit and can\'t even see it.\n\nSo, I thought a bat had come from under the car and bit me, or it was just there. I did not see it, or it bit me, and went straight under the car again; every scenario was in my head. I was wearing socks and shoes, and I thought that it was impossible that, in that small space, he would have bitten me. I looked at my stocking, but of course, I couldn\'t see anything on it; there were some spots on it, but I don\'t know what they (maybe blood, hell if I know) were.\n\nThere are no bats in my area, but I think that I am that unlucky one that stumbled upon a bat, did not see him but got bit, and my mind is constantly busy because I am afraid that in 2 months, I won\'t be here anymore.\n\nI know there is a high chance I am overreacting but can anyone tell me that I am stupid to even think about this because I don\'t want to go back to the doc for literally nothing. I am terrified and convinced that I have it, but at the same time, I think it is almost impossible; at the same time, I think I am that unlucky person who got bit without realizing that it was a bat. So sorry again, and I will understand if you don\'t reply, but if you do, I highly appreciate it.\n\nAfter the possible bat bite, something else happened.\n\n>I found an insect in my house that was annoying me very much (what was weird about it, was that it was circling in the same place for hours, is that normal). When i crashed him with my hands, i noticed its saliva on my hand and i think when i crashed him, his saliva got injected in my finger, now of course being scared of rabies, i automatically thought that the saliva was rabies saliva and the i am that unlucky one, that an insect saliva carries it now it is in me. Also, it was not leaving that same place for hours, is it normal, I know what i am saying is almost not logical, but still I have that doubt that it was rabies saliva and some insects can carry it and pass it to humans.My main question is guys,\n\n1. do insects carry it, like ever, or am I overreacting again. Because i saw its saliva on and in my finger getting injected when i crushed him, but i am scared that it could have been rabies.\n2. Can insects have it, or carry it Thanks again and sorry for the ""stupid"" questions, i just can\'t take my mind off of this. Or would it be possible that it was not its saliva, but another animals saliva that the insect dipped in a few hours or days ago and when i crushed him, it was not its saliva but another animals. But i think i saw that the white thing was coming out of insect so i think it would have been the insects saliva or something else that they have in them, but i am sure it was saliva.\n3. Should i worry about the bat scenario or not? Thank you\n\nI know it may seem like I am making fun of this, but I am not. I am truly scared, and I don\'t want to go back to the doc saying the same thing all over again. Thank you for understanding.\n\n>[*Last edited by ShadowStorm777*](https://www.nomorepanic.co.uk/posthistory.php?p=2062809)*; 06-12-22 at* *14:44.*'"

What can I do to help myself right now?

Smoke cigarettes daily for 11 years. Used to be 2 packs a day, now between half a pack to a whole pack a day, using delta 8 to help some pain and mental stuff but I don\'t want to be.\n\n Again I am so sorry for how much I typed.

For someone who has many symptoms falling under many medical diagnoses, how do you know what the red flags are for cancer when it could just be another factor of them?\n\nI feel like people dont talk enough about chronic illnesses and an amount of medical problems so large you need an excel sheet. \nSay you think youre having a heart attack. Or a seizure. Or a stroke or sepsis or something even worse. Youre wondering if you should go to the ER so you look up symptoms of the issue at hand, and read information provided by organizations trying to raise awareness and save lives in the process. The website says call 911 and go to the ER immediately. As someone with debilitating and wide ranging symptoms, these things are never impossible. Yet as most people would go to the ER, I do not as they can be regular, any day symptoms for and maybe just a bad flare up. \n\nBack to the pointif I have nearly every red flag of a developing cancer, and I cant tell what is alarming enough or not, how do I know when cancer is a possibility? I could go to my doctor but she would tell me they are apart of the 10 diseases I struggle with. \nMy gut feeling is not even trustable enough anymore. I am worried I have cancer but the resources I have are limited because Im treated like any other regularly chronically ill patient. A normal person would walk into a doctors office, say theyve had unexplained weight loss recently or are easily bruising or have swollen lymphnodes, and a doctor might red flag them for cancer.\n\nBasically I am just wanting to see anyones opinions on this matter, especially healthcare workers. I think about this a lot, enough that I know I cannot be the only one who wonders how to know when to get help or assume the worst. \n\nIf anyone needs any extra details or background information I can reply to your comments. I have some ideas as to why I could have cancer, but then again it could just be a normal day in the life for me. Beware my diagnoses list can be quite lengthy but if it helps I am more than willing to drop it below.'"

Today he\'s tired and coughing way worse and more often (like it at least seems like more than or just about every few minutes) and you can hear in his voice he\'s sick. If I were a legal adult I\'d probably risk the chance of icy roads to take him to a doctor (note I said chance lol, the ice should be clearing up today yet apparently still caused a wreck even though the roads aren\'t slippery anymore??) but I\'m not, and my mom (who\'s been instructing me what to do) is in another state with my brother and her mom for \\~9 more days, left weeks ago and before he got sick.

Other times he\'s been sick he\'d say something like ""I will be"". So like this is kinda pretty bad for him.  Last time I took care of someone who was having medical problems because everyone else was either out of state or busy, it was because he(not my dad) was scared and recovering but didn\'t need anything other than company so it was less stressful, so while I\'m more ready to help than I would\'ve been it\'s kinda a leap from company-->main care provider until family returns.\n\nMom\'s been worried for him while she was here and said she\'d wait in bed until she made sure he was breathing before going to sleep, so I\'m assuming she noticed him stopping in his sleep before or just worrying about it because asthma and snoring and having to sleep with that little air thing you put in your nose while sleeping and you put water into part of it and stuff. And I almost forgot to add because when I did I turned my computer off and so I had to retype all this, he\'s doing the kind of coughs where some of them he kinda wheezes and then manages to cough.\n\nI\'m not asking for a diagnosis because this is online and I don\'t know everything that\'s going on, but more like for support and advice and possibilities, basically if you have anything helpful you can say then please say it because I\'m really worried about him.

Tested negative for flu and negative for covid at an urgent care. \n\n(First day) Yesterday a little past midnight, my right sinus started feeling off, and my upper right lung started feeling off, and I had a slight dry cough. By 6 am I had a fever, my right sinus was sore, and my upper right lung was sore. By 8am I had a fever, chills, painful skin on my entire body, all my joints hurt, I had serious back pain, a small headache on the back right side, right sinus burning, upper right lung burning, and a slight dry cough. By that afternoon Im totally out of it and go to the urgent care to get tested for covid and the flu. The tests are negative, and the doctor is bewildered. He suspects its a virus, and says to get bloodwork at a hospital if I dont show improvement in two days. They give me cough syrup. \n\n(Day two) Today I feel just as bad, but Ive been taking cough syrup and naproxen to keep the fever down. All the symptoms are the same today, only both sinuses are affected now, I have a sore throat, and Ive been coughing up almost gray phlegm with very small streaks of blood. I suspect the blood is from the coughing. I cough very violently and gag as if I were to throw up, its just how I am. \n\n(Tonight) Right now everything is the same as earlier, but my upper right lung now feels fine, and my neck muscles are now quite sore. My headache is gone now. \n\nIve never had any illness come on this incredibly fast before, I went from fine to shaking in bed in the span of 8 hours.

Still have my tonsils. Once around 8 or 9, I woke up and couldn\'t move my body from the waist down and was hospitalized. They couldn\'t find anything wrong. Once around 12 I was leaking whiteish liquid from my breasts and they thought it may be cancer. It was not. Around 13/14 I started feeling very light headed in the shower and my vision would go black and I couldn\'t hear anything. Pediatrician said I was anemic and deficient in vitamin D. Prescribed salt pills and vitamin D. Struggled a lot in school in comparison to others despite heavy studying and attending tutoring often, from elementary to high school. Periods very painful, heavy, and lasted around10-12+ days. Started taking birth control pills at 19 and have been skipping periods since then. I have about 4-5 periods a year. Never been pregnant. No STDs. Only major surgeries: wisdom teeth removal twice, sesamoidectomy (foot) surgery 2021. Took accutane twice as a teenager. Have had bad skin since about 6 years old, acne, premature aging by 18. Had braces twice, teeth/jaw/bite still not right. TMJ problems, will need jaw surgery in the future. Have always gotten a burning sensation in my throat when running/vigorous exercises, and have to stop early not because I can\'t push my body any further, but because my throat\'s on fire. Shin splits always happen when doing cardio. When I was about 20 I gained about 40lbs within 2 months (side effect from medication) and was told I was prediabetic. I\'ve since lost the weight, no longer prediabetic. I\'ve had 3 concussions and 1 major seizure (caused by medication). September 2021 had excess white blood cells in urine at gyno appointment. Always been tired no matter how much sleep I get. Body does not respond to caffeine. Can be difficult to do normal or even fun things when I\'m often exhausted, physically and mentally. Fatigue/brain fog/memory problems for as long as I can remember. Very pale, inability to tan, very sensitive to the sun, skin burns very easily (can happen in less than 10 mins without sunscreen. I now wear sunscreen everyday).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**What doctors have said:** \n\nInsurance at the time required referrals to see specialists. My **first PCP** *refused* to refer me to an ENT *for several months* (I\'m talking I got sick in September 2020, verbally requested around October then several times via email and calls and during checkups, and didn\'t see the ENT until MAY 2021!! and this doctor also missed a whole broken bone in my foot so...love that for me) because *she was offended* that I didn\'t ""trust her"" to solve my issues on her own (even though it was all telehealth and she never actually physically examined me???) But I eventually got them to get me a referral. \n\n**ENT** *confirmed there is a lot of mucus indeed stuck in my throat*. She put a camera up my nose and down my throat (I was not prepared for that btw, not fun). However she said that since it was too far down and ""around a corner"" per say, she couldn\'t use her tools to get it out for me and instead prescribed some meds that did nothing. She said I have acid reflux and gave me instructions on how to reduce it. I did everything suggested and reflux is rare now, but the problem still remains. After 2ish months she confirmed again there\'s still mucus back there. But the good news is she said I don\'t have any vocal cord damage which is amazing. But she also mentioned she\'s never had a patient with the same issues I have and doesn\'t know how to help at this point, I just love hearing that from my doctors. She suggested I see a GI specialist. Had to pause all visits for about 6 months bc I lost my insurance after quitting my extremely toxic/abusive workplace. \n\nThe gaslighting starts here with the **GI specialist** who *ran zero tests*, said I was too young to be having these issues (okay so explain why I\'m having them, and shouldn\'t it be alarming that I\'m having these issues ""so young""?). She suggested it\'s likely ""just anxiety."" She said I should have stuck with working with an ENT for my problems, didn\'t understand why I was referred to her, but gave me a prescription to try anyway. Surprise, it didn\'t help. \n\nThe **Allergy specialist** I saw was a sweet old lady and I really believe she tried everything she knew. Worked with her for about 6 months. Said I was positive for a sinus infection and said that it\'s likely what I\'ve had the entire time. Did a pulmonary function test and said my breathing was abnormal and my lung capacity is much worse than it should be at my age and given lifestyle. She treated me for the sinus infection and later gave me an inhaler to take twice a day, along with an emergency inhaler to use before exercise. At a follow up she said my lung capacity was at 70. I still don\'t know exactly what this means, but it didn\'t sound good. I suggested wanting to get a chest x-ray done, and to see a pulmonologist at this point and she agreed. Got chest x-ray done, she called me and said ""everything looks fine"" and that was it on that. I got a food allergy test done bc at this point I\'m thinking something I\'m eating everyday could be the cause, but no. (I will say I\'d like to redo the test with another ENT for a second opinion, bc the way this test was carried out was unusual imo) After this, she told me my body is so sensitive and she\'s tried everything and doesn\'t know how else to help me. I just about lost it right there, it was just so devastating to hear. One of her final suggestions was that it could be ""a minor cough"" like she has, and/or it could be all in my head from \\*drumroll\\* *anxiety*. Even after having proof from the ENT that there is definitely mucus there and I\'m not imagining it. Just wonderful.\n\nSaw a **pulmonologist** and they *completely dismissed me* and *didn\'t test me for anything*. Said something along the lines of, ""honey this is just anxiety what you\'re describing, us women have it, it\'s very common!"" and that anxiety can create a ""lump in the throat"" sensation, but nothing is there. DESPITE AN ENT STICKING A CAMERA DOWN MY THROAT AND CONFIRMING SOMETHING IS IN THERE! *She suggested trying regular, over the counter meds that I\'ve already tried. ((wow, doctor you cured me!!))* This interaction was infuriating! \n\nWent to a **naturopath** to see if alternative medicine would work for me. They drew my blood, forgot to test me for immunodeficiencies/autoimmune disorders (love that), but did state that my B12 was low and my vitamin D is one of the lowest she\'s ever seen (no shock to me, I\'ve always been told this since I was a kid, I just hadn\'t taken vitamins in a while). Suggested I buy her expensive vitamin supplements, but I just got some from amazon bc I just couldn\'t afford vitamins for over $70/month each. She also asked me about my past and family life and said that *sometimes when you hold on to trauma too long, it can cause problems with your gut health* which is where our immune system is etc and can become weakened, and manifest into physical illnesses that won\'t go away until the trauma is correctly processed and immune system is healed. On one hand it sounds far out, but on the other hand it did kind of make sense. But at the same time, for me, I know my issues started as an actual illness. She said I need to start therapy, (and also purchase a very expensive controversial water therapy program she was selling) but at that time I couldn\'t afford that. \n\nFound a **new** **pulmonologist** on a whim while just messing around on google maps in my area and decided to give it a try. Went to my first appointment with him about 2 weeks ago, told him everything, showed him my x-rays. This is the first doctor I\'ve seen so far that seems like he actually cares. He told me *he believes me*, and knows it isn\'t "" just anxiety"" and that he will try his very best to help me. I felt so validated and so heard and understood that day. He said the x-rays do not indeed look normal and ordered a chest CT scan. He suggested that I stop using my inhaler bc it was likely *making my problems worse* by drying out my throat, which causes my body to super overproduce mucus. Also prescribed a **nebulizer** to use twice a day, and told me to take regular **Mucinex without the D** so I can try to cough some of the mucus up. I\'ll be going in for a follow up next week for my results. \n\nWent to my **new PCP** also about 2 weeks ago. He was also a shining star in my eyes, bc he also seems very caring and really wanted to help me. He said he sees weird and unique situations all the time so he seemed confident in helping me. They drew some blood that day, and also wanted me to get a 2nd round of bloodwork done somewhere else for more in depth tests/results. I have an appointment next week for the 2nd round of bloodwork, and will have a follow up soon after that. In the meantime, they called with the first half of my results, saying my **B12 was high** but that\'s okay, that my **vitamin D levels are insanely high** and could result in vitamin D toxicity so cut back on the dosage, and that my **blood** **platelet count was a lot higher than usual**, but they said we\'ll discuss that further and also retest it at my next appointment. For context, they said the normal range is between 130-140, but mine was 421. From what I understand, the rest of the bloodwork will be tested for autoimmune disorders, thyroid issues, cancer and a few other things. \n\n**BONUS:** I\'m just getting over another upper respiratory infection that lasted about 3 weeks. During the 2nd week I had 3 instances within an hour while I was awake at home on my computer, where my throat was closing on me and I was gasping for air. Felt like I was gonna die. Decided to go to the ER (my partner drove me). The doctor there was one of the worst I\'ve ever encountered and he actually made me cry when we left. First thing he asked is, ""so, what exactly are you expecting me to do?"" ...I was shook to say the least. Didn\'t see that coming at all. I said, ""I\'m expecting you to help me."" He proceeds to tell me that ""this is an ER. You are not having an emergency. If you came to me WHILE you couldn\'t breathe, I could\'ve helped. But you\'re perfectly fine right now. You\'re not showing signs of panic or distress and your vitals are fine. So what do you expect me to do?"" VERY close to me, staring me down, speaking in a very condescending tone. I was just so blown away by his behavior and lack of empathy. I said, ""Okay, so how would you help me if my throat was closing or I had mucus blocking my airway right now, what would you do?"" He said, ""Well, there are so many different things we could do depending on the situation, I could shove a breathing tube down your throat, or even better, I could shove one of those tubes down your throat that we use on BABIES, kinda like when they have too many boogers in their noses and suck all of that stuff out of there."" The way he said that was definitely to make me feel bad and to compare my problem to a baby who can\'t blow their nose. Just insane. Something has to be done about the way patients are treated when seeking help. I understand some people go to the ER for nothing. But not everyone. I told him I felt like I was dying. He said he couldn\'t do anything and doesn\'t know what to tell me. All the medications I\'ve tried is something he would\'ve suggested, which, fair on that since I have tried a lot. But then someone came in with some paperwork for me to sign saying something about I agree that I was treated today, argued with her for a minute saying I wasn\'t treated. She gave me paperwork to take home and it said to take Allegra   -\\_- I refused to sign the paperwork and left. I just thought that was such a wild situation I wanted to include it. \n\nSo, that\'s where I\'m at right now. I appreciate any comments, and thank you so much if you took the time to read this whole thing <3\n\n**TLDR:** I\'ve had mucus stuck in my throat for over 2 years that\'s too thick to cough up and after seeing several doctors and specialists no one can figure out what exactly is wrong, why this is happening or how to treat it. This is causing a laundry list of other problems including breathing problems, losing my voice daily, throat closing, and mucus blocking my airways which makes me feel like I\'m suffocating. I\'ve tried tons of medications. It is affecting my quality of life significantly. Looking for answers or comfort in knowing I\'m not the only one going through this.'"

I have been having a ""thumping"" deep within my right ear whenever I tense my tympani muscle (I can do it voluntarily). This only happens when my muscle tenses (either voluntarily or with a reaction like to bright light, yawning or stretching), never involuntary or consistent. It feels like my ear is ""muffled"" during this period. My best guess is that I\'m having trouble regulating pressure in the right ear and the tympanic membrane is experiencing abnormal changes to pressure causing it to expand and retract (causing the thumping noise). I notice it most early in the morning upon awakening or after laying down for a long period. I even feel like the ear gets muffled when I open my mouth wide. I got a camera to try and see what was happening when I tensed the muscle and I noticed there seems to be a pit/hole near the outer edge of the tympanic membrane that used to not be there. Unsurprisingly, it is not present in the left ear that is not experiencing this issue. Could this be the cause of what\'s going on? What could this hole be?'"

But this is \ngetting dangerous and we\'re getting nervous.\n\nMy brother has been losing weight slowly over the past 5 or so years, but he is not anorexic and he in no way dislikes eating. In fact, he loves food. But no matter what he eats, his body rejects it. Foods either constipate him, or cause paranoia/anxiety, or make him fatigued, or cause stomach upset.\n\nWe suspect a possible stomach ulcer, a possible histamine sensitivity, and there\'s a weird sensation in one particular part of his intestines - like he can feel every time food passes through that one part, and sometimes it seems like things stop there. We\'re close to begging for a CT scan soon, if he\'ll do it.\n\nWe\'ve talked to a dietician who was practically no help. We\'ve taken blood tests that either show normal results, or give us information we\'re already aware of. \n\nMy mother and I have been doing so much research, trying to find foods he can eat. Foods low in histamines, foods that won\'t constipate him, foods that are gentle on the stomach and the intestines, foods that calm the nerves... We\'ve been researching saturated and unsaturated fats, GABA vs glutamate, histamines, and other topics to figure out a diet that he can tolerate. After posting this, I\'m about to try inventing a ""Low-histamine, low-FODMAP, Crohn\'s-friendly, moderate-calorie, meatless GAPS diet"" if it\'s even humanly possible to do so.\n\nBut most ""gentle"" diets, like the GAPS diet, are also low calorie - and we don\'t have the luxury of that, because the longer he goes without enough calories, the more weight he loses. We can already see his bones through his skin way more than is comfortable. He CAN\'T afford to keep losing weight.\n\nWe, and the dietician as well, have suspected some immune issues have been contributing - thus a rotation diet is recommended... yet he doesn\'t have enough foods on his ""white list"" to schedule 4 days worth of different foods to eat.\n\nHis white list includes:\n\nPork (possibly)\nZucchini\nSquash\nBroccoli\nCarrot\nBeet\nOlive oil\nHerbs in the Mint family (including thyme and sage as well)\nGinger (in small amounts, as he is still mildly sensitive to it)\nChamomile tea\nMint tea\nMatcha tea (in moderation, because in some situations it makes him feel good while in other situations it makes him anxious)\nAnd a few others - but no grains, and so far no other meats (chicken makes him feel , and beef makes him apathetic and overly analytical)\n\nKeep in mind, even these foods I just mentioned can only be eaten in moderation.\n\nWe\'re desperate. He\'s miserable, and his constant bodily discomforts combined with a seeming ""no way out"" make him talk about suicide to make it all go away. I knew my mother was taking care of him all this time, but I had no idea just how bad it was until I jumped in to help a week ago.\n\nDoes anyone have ANY advice at all on what else we could possibly try? Or maybe, again, some kind of service I could call to discuss his health with someone (since he\'s in no position to do it himself)?'"

(I am not quite sure on the actual drug name, but its prescribed) \n\nWe think we she has hypothyroidism because her mothers side of the family has it, and she constantly feels tried. And one time at the ER the blood test came back with ~9.5 mlU/L TSH level. The ER tech said it was a little high, at the time we just brushed it off. \n\nShe also has irregular periods and undiagnosed ADD/ADHD. \n\nI think she also has some type of immune deficiency because she gets sick often, about once a month. Probably caused by her being sheltered and home schooled as a kid.\n\nShe tends to sleep in for a while like 11-15 hours a day. Originally I brushed it off as she just likes sleeping in, but starting to feel like its caused by a underlying medical problem.\n\nRecently shes been waking with a sore body and feels like she hasnt really gotten any sleep. Sometimes accompanied by a migraine. This has been going on for about 2/3 months. The soreness goes away after approx 2 hours. She usually doesnt exercise, but occasionally take a brisk walk around the block. \n\nFor the random bursts of pain:\nDecember 5 2022, she randomly got hit with a lot of pain all at once. She described it as a fire inside of her while something is ripping apart her rib cage. She ended up going to the fetal position in the front seat of the car. She asked me to take her to urgent care but they were closed because it was late night, so we went to the ER. She fainted a few times from the amount of the pain on the way. There was a long wait and the pain ended up fading away (about after 4/5 hours), and it was just soreness. The ER ran some tests, IIRC most of them came back fine, but the urine test was off with a high red blood cell count, and a few other properties. They said it was probably heartburn that caused the pain and prescribed her that heartburn medicine mentioned earlier. She got discharged shortly after.\n\nShe mentioned this over a call with her mother and sister. And both of them had that similar experience, including the ER saying it was heartburn. Both of them said it never happened again. We hoped that was the case for her, but it wasnt. \n\nLast night she was randomly hit with excruciating pain again, as she described a fire was ablaze in her stomach radiating throughout her body. The prescribed heartburn meds didnt not aid the symptoms. It wasnt as bad as the one back in December and it didnt fade out quicker, with it lasting about a hour.

I do have primary insomnia, but this is very well-controlled on suvorexant, and so I get pretty good sleep overall (average 7-8 hrs).\n* Current medications: Suvorexant (15mg/night).\n* Substance use: Never-user.\n* Recent routine blood work: All normal as of 9/22. Previously (2/22), I had low ferritin without anemia and low vitamin D, so I started supplementing. That seems to have worked based on the 9/22 results.\n\n**Athletic background:**\n\nIm a recreationally competitive athlete, focusing mostly on distance running now, with prior background in Crossfit and kickboxing. I try hard to avoid injuries by cross-training so that my total running mileage is only about 25 mi/week, and I build out a schedule of \\~6 hours/week of cardio by adding cycling and swimming. I do train hard, but again, the total mileage isnt excessive. I also lift \\~3 hours/week with full-body programming I got from a strength coach. An experienced PT thinks my overall strength level is quite good for a runner. \n\n**Primary complaint and duration:**\n\nI am very prone to soft-tissue injuries that take a seemingly absurd amount of time to heal given my age. Some examples:\n\n* A year ago, I developed golf elbow symptoms maybe from doing ring work and pull-ups, but despite many months of very little use and rehab exercises, it has barely improved. This is notable because Im primarily a runner, so I dont think Im overloading my upper body (especially post-injury).\n* In July 2021, I had a knee issue with was quite minor based on MRI, diagnosed at Hoffas fat pad impingement with no actual structural injury. Yet the pain persisted for over a year, despite constant work with an experienced PT and strength coach. I've only recently gotten back -- very gradually! -- to a normal running schedule.\n* Two months ago, I strained a glute or upper hamstring (not sure how). Its not serious enough to prevent running, but it puts a damper on speed workouts, and it has not improved at all in 2 months.\n* Similar examples from prior training. \n\nI am extremely discouraged by playing whack-a-mole with injuries. I am now working with a running coach to help debug any problems with my training schedule, but my question for you all is: **Could the injuries frequency and persistence be indicative of a more systemic medical problem?**\n\nThank you so much."""

I\'ve seen 4 PCPs and 2 different urologist in an attempt to find a solution to my current medical problem. I am currently experiencing an inflamed prostate, painful urination and ejaculation, and some retrograde ejaculation. I also have a general feeling that my urethra is clogged, inhibiting full flow, especially my ejaculate. It feels like there is something crawling inside my urethra sometimes.\n\nMy health problem has been going on for over 4 years. I feel dejected right now and want to try treating myself for trichomonas via a Rx for 500mg Tinidazole. Do I need to get my urethra swabbed to confirm I have Trich before I take the aforementioned prescription? What are suggestions for next steps from here if test comes back negative? \n\nAdditional background: I developed extreme genital pain, specifically around my urethra, shortly after having unprotected vaginal sex (3-5 days afterwards). STD panel showed small amount of blood in urine but no STDs. The pain decreased from a 9/10 to around 3/10 after 2-3 days. I got another STD panel a few months later to discover I contracted HSV-2. I assumed this was the root of my existing health problems for a long time. I visited a urologist a few month afterwards. The urologist tested my urine flow along with blood panel and urine culture and everything came back fine aside from being told I had hepatitis A (odd to me as I have not been outside the US). 1st urologist put me on flowmax to see if any improvement with my symptoms. Flowmax slightly helped ejaculation and urine flow, but the problem still existed so I stopped the medication after ~2 months per his suggestion. 1st urologist suggested a cystoscopy which I opposed resulting in me ignoring my health problems for an additional year or so. I go to see a 2nd urologist who claims he knows I have prostatitis as he sees it all the time in men my age experiencing the same symptoms. 2nd urologist examines my prostate and confirms it is likely inflamed. I was put on 2 separate antibiotics over a 3 month span. The antibiotics felt like they may have helped, but may have just been the antiinflammatory properties. Urologist 2 schedules a cystoscopy. Cystoscopy showed nothing of significance, but my urologist did mention some ""nodules"" on the prostate but he was not concerned and even said I don\'t have cancer (idk how you make that judgement without a biopsy...not that I want a biopsy of my prostate). \n\nI think there are 4 possibilities, I have some type of bacterial prostatitis, I have trich, I have CPPS, or something entirely different.\n\nAny suggestions, thoughts, or advice would be appreciated!'"

I'm 5'11 229 pounds with slightly below average bodyfat. I live a very active lifestyle been working out for over 20 years and I lift quite a bit. I'm mixed with caucasian and hispanic. \n\nLong story short, I think I might have issues with the way my body metabolizes drugs and possibly even my own hormones. I'll give a few examples so you can understand where I'm coming from - pieces of the puzzle if you will?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Recently diagnosed with degenerative disc disease (21 years heavy lifting I guess), before I received the diagnosis I opted to not go to the ER as my brother told me they wouldn't do anything for me. I had a close family member bring over muscle relaxers and pain meds because I was nearly paralyzed from the pain. They told me to take the muscle relaxer before bed time because it was going to knock me out. First night, I took only a half tab and nothing. I figured I didn't take enough, the next night I took a full tab and nothing - 10mg cyclobenzaprine. Supposedly this dose was going to knock me out completely. I had insomnia all night and still had a lot of pain. \n* I take TRT at 200mg/week and I also take anastazole to keep my estrogen levels in check. At the 200mg/week mark, I have to take about 2-3mg a week of anastrozole to keep the E in check. This is perhaps 2-4x what the average TRT user would require?\n* I also take daily Cialis for the benefits on BP, slight performance enhancement in the gym and elsewhere. However, 5mg a day wouldn't even scratch the surface. I take 10mg daily and while the half life suggests that it should be active in my system for 36 hours (theoretically, it should be building up in my system), I only 'feel' it for probably 8-10 hours at best. I understand this is a hefty dose, especially for daily use but otherwise, I wouldn't feel anything. \n* Currently battling high BP and was prescribed Telmisartan. 40mg daily doesn't do anything. I saw some minor cosmetic effects at first (eliminating some fluid retention), but it seems like my body has adjusted and is now back to the same position I was in before the medication. Additionally, the medication might have dropped my BP by a couple of points - if that. I've been on for a little over a month now, it's had some time to work. \n\nI've also done courses of certain anabolics and never really observed any benefits from them. Especially oral anabolics like oxandrolone. \n\nFurthermore, my TSH is creeping up while my t3 levels are in range. It leads me to believe that my liver is now metabolizing drugs and my own hormones rapidly - so as my body is clearing out t3 faster than normal, that drives TSH up to keep pumping out t3 to make up for the rapid metabolism of the active hormone. \n\nI have researched pharmacogenetics and I'm looking at doing tests for that and to learn more about my own cytochrome P450 enzymes. I'm wondering if anyone here has experience with that? Or if you could potentially point me in the right direction where I might be able to learn more about what's going on?\n\nI know the liver is responsible for detoxing drugs and even our own endogenous hormones - it seems like maybe my liver is doing too good a job at clearing everything out. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nOverall it seems like something odd is going on in how I'm processing hormones/drugs."""

I\'ve been acting as my mom\'s caregiver for 2 and 1/2 years now. She had advanced COPD, heart failure, diabetes (without insulin), and osteoporosis. She is 71, 5\',7"", and 145 lbs. Current daily meds are: entresto (49/51 mgs), torsemide (20mgs), atorovastatin (40mgs), escitalopram (20mgs), aspirin (81mgs), glipizide (5mg 2x), prednisone (10mg), a rescue inhaler, plus nebulized budesonide and duo-neb.  Some supplements like red yeast rice, coq10, multivitamins, calcium/D3, and B-12. She has a few meds that she takes as needed as well. These are: tramadol, lorazepam, and tessalon perles. I also give her 2-3 OTC meds. Mucinex 600 mgs 2x per day and loratadine daily, then Tylenol as needed. She also recently had her first shot of ""prolia"" and thinks she is having side effects from it. \n\nI worry that all of these meds that she\'s on might be doing more harm than good. Her primary care NP recommended the supplements, and the rest of them were started by cardiologists and pulmonologists. Our local health situation seems like its in turmoil, as we seem to see different doctors just about every visit. Each one, having a different opinion... and usually wanting to stop or start new meds. At times it seems like the cardiologist and pulmonologist blames each other. Like the cardiologist says the albuterol and prednisone are bad for the heart, but one pulmonologist says breathing is ""number 1"". \n\nI know the prednisone is catching up to her, but before starting the ""maintenance"" dose, she was having bad copd flares.  She really liked her general NP, but she just left, and we saw a new NP 2 months ago. She wanted my mom to follow up with a orthopedics, and he wanted her to get the prolia shot. So she got that about 3 weeks ago, and my mom is now saying that the shot ""fucked her up"". She\'s having widespread pain, and on the verge of a flare.

Pardon my phrasing here, but are there any doctors out there still who know enough about the whole body and have the balls to take charge of the whole picture here? I feel like these docs here are playing ""hot potato"" and just tossing her to someone else. Is this just what it\'s like now?

Two other people smoked the same stuff with me and had no unusual effects.\n\nI understand of course that psychoactive drugs can have unpredictable effects, but Im just concerned because I used to be able to handle these substances without any problem.

Before this she was not completely healthy (pre diabetes, far from perfect blood test results etc), but was not weak either. Now since she started taking the medicine, day by day, her muscles became weaker and weaker, to the point that she has difficulty in walking now. She was admitted to a hospital, and the blood tests showed a very low level of Potassium and Hemoglobin. The doctors said to check her Adrenal glands, and as I googled as well, such low Potassium levels can be caused by Adrenal tumors, which cause high aldosterone levels, causing low potassium presence. But is it possible that all of this can be the side effect from the medication Medrol which can go away over time rather than a symptom of something like an Adrenal cancer? Thanks a lot for reading this, and for the reply! I truly appreciate it.'"

I go to every appt to take notes and act as their patient advocate.  Our entire lives have revolved around this pain for 3 years now.

They were very a fit weightlifter training 5-6 days a week when it started, no drug use, and it started rather suddenly - beginning with what felt like delayed onset muscle soreness from a big workout, except it never stopped.  Shortly after the pain started, there was a rapid, unintended 30lb weight loss over about 4-5 weeks.  We\'d been brushed off about the pain not going away initially, but the weight loss was alarming and was the first physical indication something was very wrong, so the doctors started paying attention.\n\nFor 2019 and 2020 we had continuity of care issues, they\'re on Medicaid so the office we go to is a federally funded practice, and there was a lot of turnover - we saw 4 or 5 doctors in 1 year because of it.  Lots of duplicated efforts and tests, retelling the same information over and over.\n\nThankfully we\'ve now gotten a primary care doctor who is determined to help us and is sticking it out.  She\'s phenomenal - but unfortunately all the specialists we\'ve seen have been entirely uninterested in joining our care team.\n\nShe knows this, and also knows everything I\'ve been doing to try to help my person get answers.  They\'ve had childhood trauma surrounding doctors so, I do all the research and make the appointments, drive them to every one and take notes during, do all of the communication with the doctors and pharmacies, etc.  So because of that - along with the lack of specialists helping, she has said along with her own research, if I find something she doesn\'t know much about (and she knows that it\'s impossible to know ***all*** of medicine), she\'ll see if there\'s a test/imaging/specialist she can justify to insurance to check for it.\n\nI have run up against a wall, and have to think there\'s something I\'ve missed among all of this.

Basically when I got here I had about a month and a half worth of my prescribed daily dose with me. I\'ve been selectively taking it by skipping most days, sometimes taking my normal dose, sometimes just taking half.. to make it last until I can get my prescriptions here in Sweden. I\'ve used maybe 2 weeks worth of my prescription in 2 months and it\'s totally wrecked havoc on my mind and emotions. I have about 30 prescribed doses left. I\'m having problems figuring out if this is normal or not. Everytime I look for answers online, i just get ""adderall abuse"" pages and I honestly dont believe I fit that criteria. \n\nEven when I normally take my adderall I suffer from higher levels of anxiety and depression but now that I\'ve started restricting my dosage I\'ve straight up been basically going off the deep end. I\'ve been having emotional breakdowns at ANYTHING that goes wrong in my life. Like full on wailing crying, shaking, inability to calm myself down, panicking, rocking in the corner.. an example of my trigger would be what something simple as just performing poorly in a video game, which normally I wouldn\'t beat myself up as badly as I am now. I brought myself to tears and made myself think I\'m not good enough to even play said game anymore so why am I even trying. After hours of calming myself down I realize it\'s crazy that I\'m even spending hours of my life crying about this kind of stuff, but I still do it\n And I still continue to do it. Even when i watch youtube videos and something ""emotionally powerful"" happens, I am sometimes fighting back tears. Which normally would never have to do. \n\nIs this a normal side effect? Or should I be worried that something else is wrong with me? I really don\'t know what to do. With covid going on it\'s been very difficult to find anyone to talk to about this so I don\'t really know where to turn. I am working towards getting rediagnosed here in sweden and I\'m making progress slowly but I just hoping that things will get better when I get back on a normal schedule with my medication. \n\nIs what I\'m doing with my medication wrong? Is there anything i can be doing better? Or do I need to just get through it. Is it not my medication and I\'m honestly just losing myself? \n\nThank you to anyone who made it this far and took the time to read my post.\n\nEdit: typod and adding info'"

I've been having issues with memory, cognition, fatigue, and headaches. My symptoms are getting worse rapidly, and I am concerned that by the time I have my next appointment with a neurologist, there won't be much left to save.\n\nPlease offer any advice you can on receiving treatment before this condition leaves me permanently disabled.\n\n**Background & Additional Information:**\n\nI am in fairly desperate need of advice. I have an unknown neurological condition, involving a broad constellation of (mainly cognitive) symptoms, that first manifested about 3 years ago and has grown progressively worse since then. I have seen three different neurologists, none of whom have been able to provide a satisfactory diagnosis or any form of treatment. At the moment, the only really useful information we have is a T2-weighted brain MRI from this past February which showed lesions and smaller abnormalities throughout my white matter, including (unusually) in the corpus callosum -- indicating demyelination and potentially some kind of autoimmune disease. The initial hypothesis was multiple sclerosis, but my most recent two neurologists seem rather confident that this is not the case (based on the lack of lesions in my cervical spine MRI, and the diversity of my symptoms).\n\nThe time between appointments is usually around 1 to 3 months. My next appointment with my current neurologist is in mid-June. I do not think I will make it that far. I am on the verge of dropping out of college due to my condition, which I can feel eroding my intellect, memory, and personality week after week. None of the providers I have interacted with so far seemed to share my sense of urgency. I have sent increasingly frequent and concerned messages (and made many phone calls to the same effect) to my previous and current neurologist -- all have been fruitless, as far as I can tell.\n\nI am trying my best to balance their approaches and priorities with my own needs; i.e., by employing a more measured tone than I am displaying here, acknowledging the unknown variables present (and risks they consider themselves liable for), and limiting the directness with which I suggest alternative courses of action -- though I'm not sure I've done a very good job. I have comorbid ADHD, depression, and anxiety, which I regret communicating to these providers (I deteriorated for \\~two years while they operated under the assumption that my symptoms were psychosomatic).\n\nIn recent weeks, the rate of decline has increased drastically. I don't know if I have another two months, much less another two years.\n\nI'm asking for any and all advice that might help me get through this (and ideally with as little permanent damage as possible), but am most critically interested in *what I can do to get the help I need from the medical system*. I've included an overview of my symptoms below in the hopes that it might guide any suggestions any of you have (like my doctors, I highly doubt that these are all related directly to my medical condition, but I wanted to err on the side of caution and be as thorough as is reasonably possible). For context, I'm a 19-year-old male in the United States. Thank you for your time.\n\n**List of neurological symptoms, as of April 2023:**\n\nMost symptoms appeared gradually around the same time (mid-2020) and have gradually worsened since then. Many symptoms, particularly the cognitive ones, sharply worsen every month or two, after which some function is gradually regained (i.e., in a pattern similar to what would be seen in vascular dementia, though the currently available evidence does not point to this as a diagnosis).\n\n* generalized, progressive, global cognitive impairment\n* loss of attention; other executive dysfunction\n* other assorted focal deficits\n* loss of spontaneity/creativity/insight\n* aphasia (mostly of the expressive variety), anomia\n* dissociation, depersonalization, and derealization (beyond what would be explained by psychological issues)\n* significant apathy and lack of motivation (again, beyond that which would be typical of depression)\n* emotional lability\n* insomnia\n* transient black spots (scotomas) and flashes (phosphenes) in central vision\n   * appear in groups and persist for between 30 seconds and an hour (but generally a few minutes)\n   * frequency is (roughly) between 1 episode/3 days and 10 episodes/day (but occurrences are generally clustered)\n   * correlate with body temperature and exertion (to a lesser extent)\n* illusory palinopsia after visual exposure to repeated patterns, especially text\n* paresthesias (mainly numbness and burning in legs)\n* occasional dizziness/nausea\n* severe and persistent fatigue\n* sharp, sudden frontal headaches (relatively uncommon)\n* presyncope, blacking of vision, etc. when standing up (much less common now)\n* dysautonomia, most notably an inability to regulate body temperature\n* ataxia, various gait issues\n* problems with coordination, proprioception\n* tremor in hands (mainly intention tremor)\n* muscle twitches, spasms, and fasciculations (primarily in arms & legs)\n* dysarthria, motor-related speech issues\n* muscle weakness\n* hyperreflexia\n* generalized memory deficits; most notable in spatial, episodic, long-term, procedural, and short-term/working memory\n* significant difficulty in recall of details, leading to excessive generalization\n\nHeadaches are infrequent, usually sharp and with short duration. Typically followed by general disorientation, malaise, and worsened neurological symptoms (with both central and peripheral manifestation).\n\n**Miscellaneous other information:**\n\n* Medications: 20mg Vyvanse, 4mg estradiol, 50mg bicalutamide, 50mcg vitamin D3 (all once daily)\n* Other health issues: severe thoracic scoliosis, exercise-induced asthma, mental health issues\n* Drug use: I drink alcohol sporadically (but have not the past few weeks)"""

I've had this issue for 20 years now, but never this bad. My left parotid randomly swells as I'm eating (sometimes repeatedly, sometimes a year might go by without noticing), and I usually manage it by pressing and massaging it to drain. When it gets bad enough that the gland becomes solid and painful, I have to wait a day or two and it'll start going down and then I'll be able to massage it.  \nI've twice gone for antibiotics before because I'd notice pus coming out of the duct. Always cleared it up without issue. (I had unrelated CT scan 3 years ago that showed that gland had atrophied and had some fat replacement. I don't recall it seeing any stones but I'm not 100% on that).\n\nThis time it's the worst I've ever had. It started Friday (5 days ago) and in several hours swelled to the max and was real painful. Could only sleep on one side, popped painkillers, etc. Next day I went to a clinic to ask for antibiotics because of history, and got clindamycin. Good thing I did, because between then and when I actually picked the drug up I got fever and chills. This resolved by Sunday, but the swelling hadn't changed. No drainage. Because it's the weekend, no doctors available, and I dont want to go to the ER and be given painkillers, sent home and charged thousands for it. I finally get ONE moment of drainage on Monday night, I manage to get some blobs of pus and brown sludge out of it, but can't keep it going. I managed to get an appointment with an ENT for Wednesday (tomorrow). But this whole time I'm sitting here in horrible pain and swelling, popping painkillers and antibiotics.  \n\n\nIs there ANY relief for this I'm unaware of? What does work:  \n1. Hot shower right on the face feels great and half the time does reduce pain afterward  \n2. Diclofenac does reduce pain, better than ibuprofin  \n\n\nWhat doesn't work:  \n1. Massage. The end goal is to get the swelling down enough so that I CAN massage, but right now there's no way. If I just touch my face a bit it will throb for hours after.  \n2. Sour candy. With no drainage, this is merely asking for horrible pain. Same with eating, not to mention I can't open my mouth very much anyway. I've been sticking to liquids.  \n3. Icepacks- they distract from the pain while using, but it comes right back when stopping. Heat is better.  \n4. Tylenol. Pretty useless.  \n5. Topical and oral Lidocaine- does seem to have a temporary effect, but its short-lived and not encompassing  \n6. Swishing hot salt water- I think this has helped in the past but only when drainage was happening. Hasn't helped this time  \n\n\nThese are all the standard remedies you hear about. Are there ANY more tips and tricks that a doc (or more likely a patient) would know about? I do have my ENT appt tomorrow and that's the only thing keeping me going. I was psyched when I finally got some drainage but it didn't last long. I've gotten decent at pain management, but this swelling just won't go down!\n\nI never considered parotid removal before this weekend, but I feel like if it wasn't for the potential face paralysation I really might!"""
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13yt9tj/can_you_possibly_solve_this_or_provide_insight/,b'can you possibly solve this or provide insight? (Long) (Very interesting case)',"b""First and last post here! \n\nThis may be a long read, but I truly, truly appreciate it if everyone would stick around and add their insight to this. \n\nBackground: 21 male, 5'10, Caucasian (Scottish, Slovakian, French) \nLocation: Canada \n\nI have 2 sisters, 2 nephews, and 1 niece, which is important to factor in, and I'll explain why briefly.\n\nWhen I was just little used to light up bright red only on my face and neck typically only in stressful or public situations (terrible social anxiety), it wasn't itchy, just hot and red and I would sweat a lot.  According to my mom (54), she used to get the same thing in front of people but eventually grew out of it. \n\nNow regarding my niece and nephews, they also get red in the face and have trouble regulating body temperature but not due to any type of anxiety, as it stands we could call it idiopathic and it resembles Lupus or maybe rosacea however - my oldest nephew also has some skin problems and my youngest often gets fevers and hives from many things but treats it with things like advil. \n\nThe above is important in MY case I believe because when I was around 13 I was put on 20mg of cipralex (2014), in October 2019 (17) I went into anaphylaxis for the first time due to amoxicillin which I took due to sinus congestion (mom also has chronically) and I had it lying around from a previous infection, the anaphylaxis scared me into not taking any medication so I abruptly cut down my cipralex and for some reason believed I wouldn't need them anymore. \n\nAfter doing this, I one day woke up with the most severe depersonalisation and derealisation anyone could ever have alongside a gross number of other discontinuation symptoms which lasted over 3 months and eventually subsided after reinstating 10-15mg of the same medication, the most IMPORTANT part of this is I had developed Tinnitus and anisacoria after this AND I couldn't take the meds anymore because I developed symptoms of seratonin toxicity so I had to get off all together and just deal with it. \n\nFast forward to 2021-2022 and now things are serious, my body is behaving terribly since I've changed things up and it's worth mentioning that the rash / redness I used to only get on my face and neck had began to progress down to my chest and eventually to my legs but it's not itchy and only happens in the sun, in stressful situations/ conditions. That's the least of it, I began getting constipated by almost ALL foods and chicken and rice were my only tolerable foods (until they weren't), I wasn't getting rashes but it's like I developed this hypersensitivity in the signals from my stomach, it began feeling tight and caused me to be severely constipated for over 33 days (not exaggerated), my blood sugar was 1.3, you could say I was intolerant to almost everything but not allergic. \n\nThis is where things got weird, at this point I've seen almost all of the BEST specialists in Canada and been to the best hospitals which costed me a lot of money that I just happened to coincidentally have (now I don't) and a lot of time, as I mentioned I had been extremely constipated UNTIL I received saline solution VIA IV injection overnight, I got home a day later and had the most excruciatingly painful poop ever and it was disgusting - I know it was from the saline IV because this happened more than once and that was the only thing I was issued other than the mix of vitamins (Please explain this if possible!) \n\nNow, I got the blockage out and still continued to have serious issues and kept myself near the hospitals (in Toronto), I had more needle holse in my arm than any addict ever (painful) due to the amount of blood work done but now I was down to 98 lbs from 184 (I was kind of overweight prior to all of this) and I had given up so I decided (f it, I'll have what I want) and started to intake calories again by what I thought was healthier (Boba, cauliflower bites etc) than what I used to have thankfully toronto had these options. \n\nAnyway, this is what leads us to the most current circumstances/ situation - everything I ate / eat lots of carbs, sugar or fibre  my body temperature increases and I get really gassy, my veins dilate massively, I become lethargic, low blood pressure and I have a red face BUT when I take things like vitamin C, D, Zinc, Dandelion, Burdock Root, Reishi (yes I taught myself natural medicine because I had to), the symptoms reverse BUT I get this 'tight' feeling in my stomach which is why I describe the whole hypersensitivity thing because I can feel almost everything.

Further context though:\n\nIm a 27y/o female who has struggled with minor mental illness most of my life but most apparently since puberty. We have landed on a diagnosis of PMDD and depression, which I dont doubt for a second, and Im being medicated for it and it helps a lot. Been through and discharged from therapy, and currently taking 300mg Wellbutrin all month, and 50mg Zoloft through my leutal phase.\n\nBut Ive been curious ever since childhood if I may have ADHD. Its always been dismissed as part of my anxiety (my first diagnosis as a child) and never looked into. More recently, Ive had a ton of things bring that back into questioning for me. One being that my 6 year old is exhibiting strong issues with staying focused and paying attention while otherwise being insanely smart and well adjusted and capable. Ask well as seeing a lot of women in r/PMDD also have ADHD and relating very strongly to their stories. And just there being more informed literature out there about women with inattentive type ADHD and I really feel I check all the boxes when I see symptoms described. Also, any anxiety type symptoms I used to have are all but gone now that Ive been through therapy and healed from some trauma and learned self soothing techniques. Its become more clear to me that my anxiety type symptoms were more just distress, and now that I know how to self soothe, all that remains are the symptoms that are pretty unique to ADHD and depression/PMDD. The latter seem to have been dulled WAY down by my medications although are still there, but the attention symptoms are just as strong as ever and its really become apparent to me how much these symptoms are holding me back from my goals and making every day life extremely difficult for me. If I could actually get treatment for these things instead of just living with them and chalking them up to personality traits, I really feel like I could move forward with my life in ways that seem so difficult now. \n\nAnyway, to my question. I want to make an appointment with my doctor to discuss this. But another strong theory I have about being correct about this is: when I went through a brief drug experimentation phase, the few times I took adderall it calmed me down a lot, made me feel level headed and sort of quieted the noise in my mind. And when I was using cocaine socially, it was a similar effect, and I could ALWAYS fall asleep with no issue. Like my friends would be bouncing off the wall, dancing, talking all hype, and up until 4am or later. Meanwhile Id be sitting down, having hyper focused deep conversations with people just vibing, then Id go to bed no problem. I feel like the way I reacted to stimulants makes for a strong case that I could benefit from them (dosed correctly by a professional). And Ive always felt I could. But I dont know if I bring that up if its going to be a red flag to my doctor and make her think Im just trying to get stimulants for funsies. I havent touched a drug other than pot occasionally in YEARS, and I dont even drink alcohol. But I wanted to know if I should bring this up with my doctor or not. On one hand I think it could be a helpful piece of information for diagnostic reasons, to know how I reacted to that. On the other though, I dont want to get dismissed again.'"

The interaction checker had said it can significantly increase the blood levels and effects of fentanyl, but didnt have much other information like on how that happens, because Im assuming if the half life is extended, continued use would do that. But again it doesnt specify and i dont know enough to fully understand what I can find about it. \n\nI really just want to know if I should be taking the precaution of calling my Dr when they open to be sure itll be all right or if it is a low enough risk with a single dose that I can call tomorrow to find a new medication and just be extra cautious with my use. I dont know enough about it to know how severe the risk is I guess so if this is not a Reddit question and requires a medical opinion that would also be awesome information to have!\n\nTIL: took one 100mg dose of fluconazole and had used fentanyl right before, and now found its classified as a major drug interaction. I am unsure if the risk is in the increased half life or I am currently at risk and should contact my Dr, or even if a 100mg single dose is enough to cause a lot of concern as long as I am cautious and call about a prescription change tomorrow.'"

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/11hqew0/rapidly_losing_the_ability_to_use_my_fingers_and/,b'Rapidly losing the ability to use my fingers and hands -- almost certainly a rare disorder -- any ideas appreciated.',"b'I am 26F. I have a known diagnosis (via biopsy -- the real deal) of (very severe) Behet\'s vasculitis, with significant involvement involving multiple systems (urinary and digestive being the main two at the moment). I suffer from erythromelalgia, which is thought to be affiliated with the Behet\'s, which checks out. \n\nI can\'t remember when my hands started getting noticeably stiff, but I know it was certain by 2020 (so probably 2019 or 2018?) We tried *everything* to narrow down what was wrong with my hands, but my doctor\'s could never figure it out. We x-rayed, there\'s no significant joint damage. Fine, maybe my hands are playing hard to get -- we MRI\'d these bad boys just to be sure -- *entirely normal.* \n\nMy doctor examines my capillaries in my nails and notices they are split (or whatever that terminology is -- he could see it with a flashlight pointed at my nails). \n\nMaybe its scleroderma -- which honestly seems still like the best bet to me -- but negative ANA. Which also rules out SLE, which is known to cause some weird shit. \n\nIn late 2021, we finally found the Behet\'s and I started Humira. All the Behet\'s symptoms went away... but my hands are still getting worse rapidly. In the summer of 2022, I switched to Stelara and, as I\'m sure you are not surprised to hear, it did absolutely nothing for whatever the hell is going on with my hands (and nothing for the Behet\'s -- back on Humira now). \n\nAs of the beginning of 2023, I can\'t even hold a pen anymore. I can\'t straighten my fingers all the way -- its physically impossible, even if someone else tries to do it, so its not due to weakness.  As of the last month, I\'m beginning to have a hard time typing (only able to type this as I am on methylpredisone at the moment).\n\nBut it just doesn\'t make any sense -- it somewhat responds to steroids, but not to TNF inhibitors. It\'s getting worse rather rapidly. We\'ve considered everything; we don\'t think its a rare manifestation of Behet\'s, despite the fact I have very rare manifestations of Behet\'s (i.e. bladder) because it doesn\'t get better with things like Humira. \n\nWhat are we missing? I have seen so many specialists, some of the best in the country, and they are all fascinated but don\'t have any leads. At this rate, I\'m not going to be able to feed myself by 30. I\'m starting to get scared as I notice its getting worse. \n\nThe only other unexplained symptoms I have is I have lost the majority of my hair (started losing it in 2020 as well) and that also has not cleared up with Humira or anything. \n\nFurthermore, I still think scleroderma makes the most sense (particularly the CREST variety), but I can\'t shake the lack of ANA -- is there anything (i.e. medications, supplements) that could cause a false negative ANA? It\'s baffling that a lot of people are ANA positive and have no illnesses at all, but I\'m ANA negative and yet seem to be a walking ad for CREST. \n\nI have no other health issues, beyond ADHD. I just want to retain what use of my hands I can because it\'s getting worse way faster than it should be. \n\nIf relevant -- I do still struggle with regular mobility and exhaustion, energy levels are still almost 0. I\'ve always assumed that the Humira is like a ""B-"" for me and my Behet\'s -- there\'s only a few sores in my GI tract, and rarely any anywhere else. But maybe the real reason I\'m still feeling wiped and beat is due to whatever is connected to my hands and not the Behet\'s. It\'s a possibility there are two very distinct diseases here. \n\nThank you. Sorry for the essay - I appreciate it. I\'ve worked my way through many medical systems and no one has any idea about the hands. I\'m hoping it sounds like something random someone remembers reading about in med school once and maybe that will launch me in the right direction. Or something.'"

I dealt with this, though it was not pleasant. However, things changed after I finished university.\n\nI finished university and got my master\'s degree in computer science. I got an entry level software developer job using my degree and things were going great. I was still dealing with headaches as always, but I was used to that. However, things started to change.\n\nThree years into work, I started getting headaches every single day instead of once in a while. They were also getting more severe. I work as a software developer so I spend a lot of time on the computer, and I also play a lot of video games. Eventually, I quit my job and  ended up moving across country with my family. The headaches were beginning to greatly interfere with my ability to concentrate at work and my mood. I decided I would take a short break, resolve the medical issues, and get a new job right after in a new place. I also decided to take some time off the computer and games.\n\nEventually, the headaches started to wind down. They slowly stopped, but I had a new problem emerging instead. The pain seemingly moved to my neck.\n\n**Explanation of problem**\n\nEvery day there is severe pain in my neck. It is mainly located here, but when it gets bad, it feels like it spreads all around my neck, sometimes feeling like the pain is in my throat:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/N0FoQPf.png\n\nThe pain is nonstop. Every day. It never, ever stops. It is extremely painful, with some days being much worse, for no explainable reason. It lasts from the moment I wake up until the time I fall asleep. It feels like a sort of dull pain, but can feel sharp when it gets very bad. When the pain gets bad, it spreads around my neck, and will go up the back of my neck into my head a bit. Any decent exercise will amplify the pain greatly, even something like a 20 minute walk. The amplified pain can last the rest of the entire day, and I\'ve also had it seep into the next day as well. I never get any pain in my arms, shoulders, or back; just my neck and partially my head. The only other action that seems to affect it is looking down for a long period of time. Laying down seems to reduce the pain after I lay down for a while, but the moment I sit up or stand up, the pain immediately starts to escalate and get worse. \n\nBeyond the pain, I have tinnitus. I\'ve always had the ringing, but don\'t know if it\'s related. When I turn my head all the way left or right, the ringing immediately gets louder. Moving my head back to normal makes it stop. Moving my jaw a lot or yawning also adjusts the volume. The ringing is very often in rhythm with my heartbeat, going louder and quieter (wee woo wee woo). It can get very loud at times. \n\nI began to seek medical help.\n\n**History of doctors**\n\nFirst, I saw a chiropractor. He did various movements on my back and neck after heating sessions. After many visits, the pain did not change at all and it was not helping. He advised that I should see a neurologist. In the meantime, I also tried a dentist to see if my teeth could be causing the problems, but there was nothing there causing issues.\n\nThe neurologist wanted to do an MRI of my head and neck. We did the MRI, and there were no problems found. He said the only thing he could see was ""benign cysts"", and he said that they would not be the cause of any problems. He additionally did a CT scan, which also showed nothing. He then referred me for some xrays which, again, showed absolutely nothing in my back or neck. He decided to refer me to pain management, saying there is nothing he can do.\n\nI went to see pain management and they immediately decided I should do an Epidural Steroid Injection into the back of my neck. They said that this would likely remove the pain for some months, and if it worked, I could get it again. I decided to do the procedure. It was very painful. For the next week, I suffered extreme side effects; I was unable to sit up or stand at all. I had no idea what was wrong. It got so bad I went to the emergency room, and they said there was an air bubble stuck in my neck. They said it would clear up in a few days, and I should get some caffeine to help speed it up. They gave me some morphine which basically deleted the pain, and sent me home. That visit sent me a bill of $10,000 since I had no insurance. A few days later, the side effects ended.\n\nAfter the air bubble was gone, it seemed like my pain was reduced and the injection helped. After a month or two, the pain began to get worse again, so, I begrudgingly decided to do the injection again. The doctor said I agreed there would be risks, so it wasn\'t his responsibility in any way. He said it happens to less than 1% of patients and he does the injections all the time. I did the injection again, and this time, there was no air bubble problems. However, it also did not help in any way. There was no pain reduction at all.\n\nThe pain continued to get worse. I told him it did not help, and he said ""it has to be an neurology problem at this point, I will refer you to a neurologist."" He also prescribed me Tramadol for the pain. The Tramadol significantly helped reduce the pain, as ibuprofen seemingly had no effect anymore. I was being very careful on taking ibuprofen because I did not want to get rebound headaches, so I was not upping my dosage, nor taking it every day. I was also trying acetaminophen, but it did not help either. The Tramadol helped a lot for my sanity dealing with the pain every day.\n\nI started seeing a general practice doc at the same time as the new neurologist. The general practice doc checked multiple things, and asked a lot of questions. He had me try muscle relaxers and also continued to prescribe me tramadol since it was helping, and I was keeping dosage under control just fine. The muscle relaxers did not help at all, so he had me try a med called Amitriptyline. He told me while it is an anti-depression drug, it will help with the pain. I did not want to take meds that mess with how I feel a lot, but I decided to try it. In general, I don\'t like taking meds, and I don\'t like how they make me feel at all (including the tramadol) but I was willing to try if they would help. The amitriptyline did help with the day to day pain overall but not enough to make it bearable. It also helped with the side effects of the tramadol.\n\nThe new neurologist looked over my MRI and other scans. He said that he believes it may be something called a ""chiari malformation."" He also said the tramadol is probably causing the pain and told me to ease myself off of it and stop taking it entirely. He ordered more scans and decided that it does not seem to be the malformation. Getting off the tramadol did not help with the pain at all after 1-2 months of not taking it, and life was hell with the extreme pain. He had me do ""trigger point injections"" and these did nothing to help either. He said he could potentially do botox injections and they may help, but advised against it regardless because ""I was young"" and ""they could cause bone problems later on in life."" In general, I did not like this doctor at all; he was very rude. Eventually, I was told he was leaving the practice and he was replaced with a new neurologist.\n\nThe new neurologist looked over everything **again**. He said the other doc was insane to think it is a chiari malformation, and took it off my chart entirely to ""not mislead people."" He was very kind and tried his best to assist me, but really did not know what could be causing the pain. He also said the pain management place was insane to immediately try an epidural injection. Ultimately, he had me try muscle relaxers *again* and also try another med called Benztropine. He said it may help with the pain as well. After taking the Benztropine for some time, it did not help with the pain at all. He referred me to a physical therapist.\n\nI saw the physical therapist and explained my issues. He had me do sessions twice a week for a few months. We did various stretching exercises in the meetings and he had me do more at home. The stretching exercises amplified the pain whenever I did them due to the physical exercise. Despite that, I did them as instructed every day. After seeing him for a few months, he told me that there is nothing more he can do, as everything he is doing does not seem to be helping. He told me that something is causing the pain, and his stretches and exercises will not help until whatever is causing the pain is gone. \n\nI returned to the neurologist and explained. He advised I should try taking some vitamin B12, so I began taking supplements for that and other vitamins. He also referred me to a rheumatologist for them to check for any diseases or blood problems, but they found nothing after multiple blood tests. He tried doing some sort of special MRI that scans for blood issues... I don\'t remember what it was called, but he saw nothing wrong after doing the test. He advised I should take the Tramadol again as it was helping with the pain, but he really did not know what to do. He advised I go see pain management again because he was out of ideas. Beyond that, he told me I should make sure my glasses prescription was up to date with blue light blocking (which I did) and I should do everything I can to make sure I have good posture and everything when I do use the computer.\n\nI told my general practice doc what happened and he still didn\'t know what to do. I tried researching online what the pain could possibly be from, but still had no idea. He decided to refer me to a university nearby to see a neurologist there, saying that they may have the knowledge and expertise to pinpoint the problem. I was really not happy with seeing another neurologist given what has transpired so far, but I decided to try. He also gave me a referral to an ENT to check my throat.\n\nAt this point, I got a new job working remote because it was clear this problem was not going to resolve itself any time soon. The new job is very easy to do but does not make full use of my degree. It at least gives me insurance, as I have spent thousands of dollars now with no aid. One day I had particularly bad pain and decided to just go to the ER and hope they could find something wrong... but this did not help at all. They just gave me some morphine and tell me to follow-up with my general practice doc. This completely removed the pain and I felt what it was like to be pain free for once in a long time, but didn\'t actually help to bring me to a solution.\n\nThe new neurologist at the university said I should have **another** MRI done. She said that their process is very detailed and they will look over things with scrutiny and have a good chance of finding the problem. So, I did another MRI scan. She looked things over and found nothing. She had no useful advice to give. She said ""you have tried everything we can give in terms of meds"" and she did not believe it to be a neurological problem. She said I should see an orthopedic doc to see if they find anything. She also advised a nearby headache institute might be able to find something, but she also said it is extremely unlikely they will see me if I\'m taking tramadol. \n\nI saw the orthopedic doc and he had me do new x-rays. He looked over those and my other scans. He found nothing wrong and he said that he has no reason to perform any surgery because he sees nothing wrong. He had no advice to give and said there was nothing he could do.\n\nI saw the ENT doc I was referred to, and he stuck a tube up my nose to look at my throat, and he immediately just said he saw nothing wrong. He had no advice to give.\n\nAt this point, I\'m pretty much losing hope. My general practice doc was out of ideas at this point since I\'ve tried many meds and seen many doctors. He referred me to a new pain specialist to look things over. The new pain specialist really did not know what to do, but insisted I should try trigger point injections again. I did them, and nothing changed, once again. Because they did not help, he said I should try botox. My insurance denied the procedure, twice. He said he would do it for free with samples he has, and gave me the botox injections. A month passed and the pain did not change at all. He is out of ideas and does not know what to do. He told me to keep taking tramadol since it seems to help.\n\n**Today**\n\nThat\'s the end of my story up until present day. This is where I stand now. The pain has gotten worse over time. It still hurts, every day, never stopping. The pain is so severe some days that if I did not have the tramadol to reduce it, I would want to go to the ER. Many days I just want to lay down and sleep as much as possible so I am not awake, dealing with the pain. I have to push myself to do my job and often just want to sleep once it\'s over. No doctor has been able to figure anything out, and none of my doctors have any idea of what to do next. At this point my general practice doctor says that I should expect to live with the pain, and advise reading books about ""living with pain."" The pain is way too high to just tolerate. I can\'t stand it.  I can\'t do any exercise because it will make the pain even worse. I spent months forcing myself to do exercise routines, walks, stretches, but it just makes it hurt more and doesn\'t do anything to help.\n\nI might be forgetting some things, but it\'s been a painful few years. I really don\'t know what to do. If anyone has any ideas of what I can try or do, please tell me. Nobody seems to know anything about it. Nothing I do helps. I am getting very depressed.\n\nSorry for the long story. Thanks for reading.'"

Successfully treated within lithium and lamotrigine as of July 2021. I was an avid track athlete that developed sudden exercise intolerance at 13yo; had a full cardio work up including echocardiogram that was all negative. Receiver inhaler for EIA that was never effective.\n\nI have had a history of frequent infections (primarily strep throat + sinus infections in teen years), including MRSA at 15yo and mono at 20yo.\n\nI also had severe menstrual symptoms (heavy bleeding, severe mood disturbances) that went away with hormonal IUD in 2017.  \n\nIn fall 2017, I had two concussions, mono, and severe period symptoms from a new IUD at the same time. Soon after, I noticed a small rash on my left leg; a dermatologist said it was dry skin after refusing to inspect it in 2020. This rash never went away. After chronic sinusitis, I was treated by an ENT for a deviated septum via septoplasty in spring 2021.\n\nIn December 2021, I exchanged my kyleena IUD for a mirena one since the bleeding had returned. I knew they had misplaced it due to severe pain of insertion, but my concerns were brushed off. In March 2022, I began having a sinus infection that lasted for a few months that was unresponsive to repeated rounds of antibiotics. \n\nIn June 2022, my misplaced IUD shifted out of place, causing the worst pain of my life. I went to the ER and was there for seven hours before removal. I had a new one placed properly the following week.\n\nJune 2022 onwards: The ER visit coincided with the worst of my sinus infection that was still not clearing. I started feeling extreme fatigue and was at times too exhausted to sit up in bed or eat. I began wearing a Fitbit to monitor heart rate and noticed POTS symptoms (resting = 80, standing after 10min = 145-160). My ENT prescribed high dose antibiotics and tapered methylprednisone course which cleared the infection after a week. However, the fatigue had not cleared so I used a wheelchair to return to work. I was able to start walking again soon after but still had POTS symptoms. My PCP gave me some referrals to cardiology, endocrinology, neurology, and dermatology. \n\nI felt better, but over the following 6mo, I began rapidly losing weight (close to 20lb) and had zero appetite and recurrent nausea, at times forgetting to eat for an entire day. I have noticed three more of the leg spot rashes on my leg appear in this time. These rashes are not painful or itchy, are dark red/brown and look like a cluster of small dots. They worsen or appear during severe POTS flares. \n\nI have had swollen lymph nodes for a long time but had previously attributed them to sinusitis. In November, I had another severe POTS episode leading to more wheelchair use that coincided with another (shorter) sinus infection. Since then, my POTS has been moderate, but I have felt so unwell otherwise at times that I truly felt I didnt have much longer to live. Last week I assembled some furniture and found 6 large bruises on my legs and arm afterwards with no pain.\n\nMy cardiologist agrees that there are POTS symptoms but cannot account for the symptoms of a secondary illness. I had an echocardiogram done today and will have a ZIO patch and autonomic reflex test later this week. An endocrinologist has ordered a thyroid test (which was normal in June) and a cortisol test for Addisons. I am waiting on a dermatologist appointment for a biopsy. I have had multiple normal EKGs.\n\nThe general consensus is that I either have a condition that is associated with POTS or that I have had mild POTS since adolescence that is being aggravated by another physical stressor.\n\nOptions we have discussed include:\n\n- Addisons \n- Vasculitis\n- Dysautonomia/POTS\n\nOther contenders given allergy like sinus problems include \n- Mast cell activation syndrome\n\nIf the rash is petechiae\n- Endocarditis\n- Vasculitis\n- Leukemia\n\nOr some vitamin deficiency\n\nLab work in June showed high cholesterol, high immature granulocytes (attributed to stress), negative mono test \n\nFamily history of B12 deficiency, osteoporosis, migraines, MS, multiple systems atrophy\n\nDoes anyone have any insight? Despite on and off infections and a general intolerance to standing/exercise, I was healthy in May of 2022. Now, I am winded walking around my apartment and am too fatigued to do something as simple as laundry. The weight loss has been particularly startling, and if anything I have had problems with moderate weight gain in the past. None of my clothes fit me anymore and I keep having to buy new pairs of pants. The rashes on my leg are not itchy or painful and do not lighten when pressure is applied. They seem to worsen as my health worsens.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n[Update] Echocardiogram results show nothing remarkable, possibly ruling out endocarditis.'"

The only thing that helps me do so is Lorazepam but the doctors dont want to give me any more.\n\nI fully understand and have educated myself on the long-term side affects but have yet to notice any cause for concern. Even as far as immediate side affects go, I occasionally get drowsy after taking it but not sure if thats the lorazepam or just the mental/emotional toll of leaving my house. \n\nI was prescribed it by a doctor who was happy for me to be on it and agreed that anti-depressants were not the way to go. Theyve never worked previously and I dont have depression.\n\nWell a couple of months ago (Id been on lorazepam for about 5 months, I want to say), I asked for some more medication and was told no. During this 5 months, not once was I asked how I was doing, how the medication was impacting me, any side affects, etc. I was simply being given it and then told no. The only thing I take Lorazepam for is to get to imperative appointments. Meaning that if I have 3 appointments in a month, Ill take Lorazepam 3 times in that month. If i have 1 appointment in a month, Ill take lorazepam once in that month, etc. Hy appointments I mean doctors appointments, e.g. check ups, blood tests, cervical screenings, etc.\n\nThe benefits significantly outweigh the side affects because Im currently not experiencing any. It allows me to leave my house and go to see doctors in person. Recently, Ive had to rely on seeing them over the phone. I was told to go in for an EKG and couldnt.\n\nI have toothache but cant see a dentist. I have severe psoriasis and finally got a call saying they have an appointment for me but I had to cancel it. My partner and I have to move soon and if the move requires more than a 2 minute drive, I cant leave. I have gynaecological issues going on and been referred, havent gotten an appointment date but I wont be able to go to that either.  \n\nI have so many things I need to get sorted but cant.\n\nHow do I make the doctors understand this?\n\nI struggled with something similar back when I was 15-16 and my doctor happily allowed me to take Diazepam whenever I needed it. I wasnt forced to ration it or made to feel dirty for asking for more. I was given 28 at a time, whereas they only give me 7 lorazepam at a time. He monitored me, checked in, asked how they were helping me, what I was using them for, etc. Eventually I came off of them because I no longer needed them. I never had to increase my dose or experienced any side affects. I was taking them for almost a year. \n\nThe doctors have since prescribed me Mirtazapine. I knew that this would do nothing for my acute anxiety or help me leave the house but I took it anyway because I felt forced. I was also given promethazine but again, it doesnt seem to help. \n\nMy psoriasis is getting worse, my teeth are getting worse, my anxiety is getting worse because I feel the one thing I can count on to help me leave the house is no longer accessible. I dont know what to do.\n\nSurely I have some say and choice in this? Ive not experienced any withdrawal or noticed any tolerance build up (2mg is my magic number and its remained just as effective the entire 5 months, no need to increase my dose - even if I did need to, I wouldnt because I have a severe phobia of vomiting and would be terrified that 3mg could end up making me sick. 2mg feels safe). \n\nIve been made to feel like some kind of drug addict for asking for it. I feel dirty and guilty but I just want to know that if I need to go to an appointment, I can. Same as if someone gets car sick and needs anti-sickness tablets on a car journey. I need lorazepam to go to appointments. \n\nIve expressed Im more than happy to have weekly calls, be monitored, provide proof of appointments and when/how Im taking the medication. What else can I do? \n\nIm incredibly open to trying other medications but I want to know that until I find something else that works, or until I get better, Ill be able to have access to lorazepam for when its imperative that I get somewhere. \n\nI also understand that exposure is important and I cant rely on them forever but I have so much going on right now that needs to get sorted and is causing me overwhelming stress and anxiety, that I just need the extra help and knowing I have something to rely on. When Ive got my psoriasis sorted, teeth sorted, know where Im going to live etc, Ill feel much more prepared to try things without medication. But with my psoriasis for example. Ive been waiting for MONTHS for this appointment. If I go without Lorazepam, freak out and leave, Ive now missed out and who knows how long Ill have to wait again. I cant even shower, my hands are raw and my nails are falling off. Its not something I can just chance, like going to the shop. If I go to the shop and have to leave, no big deal. But appointments, I have to see it through and lorazepam is the only thing that guarantees I can.\n\nI totally understand that if I was showing signs of addiction or tolerance build up or any negative long term side affects but the doctors havent even seen me or asked me any questions so I dont understand taking me off of it when Im only using it a couple of times a month for appointments.\n\nHow do I convey this to the doctor?'"

I do still have a lot of body fat, but my chest is bigger than my stomach and I don\'t have a rounded belly (partially due to how well I carry my weight). I am pretty closely related to Lou Ferrigno to give an example of similar genetic make-up. Even if I wasn\'t fat, I would still wider (skeletally) than 99% of people my size.

I only take it at this level for games/scrimmages which there are usually 11 of. Before hard practices (5 days a week for the first 4 weeks of the season and 2 or 3 days a week for the next 12 weeks) I usually take 4 ibuprofen, 2 acetaminophen, and occasionally 2 more acetaminophen, or 1 naproxen. After those practices I usually forget to take anything but at times take 2 more acetaminophen or ibuprofen. I try to use these as little as possible throughout the rest of the year just because. I have been doing this for 3 years and will continue to do it for the next 2.\n\nI have previously been told by doctors I can take 4 ibuprofen and 2 acetaminophen at once but they said that is like a maximum for the day. Also been told 4 ibuprofen twice a day, 8h apart. Now this amount is a lot and I know that it is damaging my liver regardless, but is it as bad as it looks on paper? Also is there realistically concern that the amount I take during the season will have serious lifelong effects on me?'"

The only medications Im currently on are some supplements (calcium, vitamin D) Zoloft, and the implant. \n\nI had an appointment with a new rheumatologist today. I have lupus (that is well under control and has been since 2016) and have seen many doctors over the past seven years. I was on the combination pill from 2017 to May of last year, when I got the nexplanon implant. \n\nI didnt find it until after I left (she doesnt have my medical records yet) but I had a test done in 2017 to test for antiphospholipids and all that and it was negative. All my doctors have said that all birth control with estrogen increases blood clot risk so I was aware of that. But they also said that because I have no genetic disposition to blood clots, and my lupus is very much under control, it should be safe for me.\n\nThe new rheumatologist said the opposite. She said just having lupus is a huge contraindication to ever taking anything containing estrogen. That genetics and lupus activity have absolutely nothing to do with it, just being on something with estrogen while having a lupus diagnosis meant my chance of having a blood clot and/or a stroke was through the roof and that if I left the implant in I would definitely have one eventually. She also said I never should have been allowed to take the pill I was on or get the implant, and thats what current research says and has said for years. But all I could find online was exactly what all the other doctors have told me. Just that the risk is a bit higher but it should still be safe. \n\nAnd having looked into it, Nexplanon appears to not have estrogen in it at all, which was not what the new rheumatologist said when I was in the office. She looked it up and started going on about how I need to have it removed asap. \n\nI feel like one of the doctors Ive seen would have said something if it wasnt safe? I was seeing my old nephrologist, rheumatologist, and primary care before and during my stint on the pill. I asked if birth control would be safe before ever taking it and they said it should be for all the reasons I listed. I even saw them after I got the implant. They were well aware and just asked how I was doing on them every appointment. My old nephrologist was super happy that my period pain was finally under control. My gynecologist inserted it and just asked if I had migraines or a family history of blood clots. My new primary care and nephrologist are also fully aware and didnt think anything of it, just asked if there was any family history of blood clots. \n\nSo thats two nephrologists, a rheumatologist, two primary care providers and a gynecologist that have all said it should fine based on my medical history. The new rheumatologist says the only part of my medical history that matters at all is the lupus diagnosis and thats all she needs to determine that I should not ever take anything containing estrogen. \n\nIt just seems odd that only one doctor out of so many has said something and that I cant find anything online that says no one with lupus should ever have anything with estrogen because its 100% not safe. Everything just says it may not be safe for some people with lupus, but your doctor can run some tests to determine if its safe for you. Which is obviously not no one with lupus should ever take this. But I could also just not be looking in the right place. \n\nI dont want to assume shes wrong because if shes not then obviously its very good to know, but it just seems really weird that no one else has ever said anything close to it and this is by far the best birth control Ive ever been on. Im on it for suspected endometriosis and I havent had a single period since I started on it, its been amazing and I really dont want to go back to the pill because that wasnt nearly as effective.\n\nIm going to talk to my other doctors tomorrow (theyre closed now) but I just wanted to ask around now for peace of mind because I really, really like this birth control.

I noticed that my heart started to race pretty fast and I felt kind of faint, the left side of my body started to feel kind of tight and off and as my heart rate kept climbing I thought I may be having a medical emergency like an overdose or heart attack. So I figured no matter what is happening, I should administer Narcan to myself to block the fentanyls effects. Considering I was alone, even if I wasn\'t overdosing or having a medical emergency I\'m still alone so if it does happen I\'m probably going to die right here. I immediately called 911 after administering the narcan to myself incase of a medical emergency, I only told them I suspected an overdose. As I waited for the paramedics to arrive my body and face started to feel very weak and numb, I felt very confused and disoriented mentally. By the time the paramedics arrived I could hardly walk or move at all, was stumbling everywhere and very unsteady. The paramedics were talking to me and I could barely put my speech together or even move my mouth to try and speak. Slurring and stumbling over my words and speaking very slow. I had a hard time understanding what they were saying to me and asking. I felt very out of tune and disconnected from reality. I continued to be very mentally, verbally and physically slow for quite a while afterwards, probably an hour or 2. They brought me to the nearest hospital I told them my heart started racing heavily before I narcaned myself and they ordered all sorts of labs, gave me an IV of fluids and ordered a chest xray but during my mental fog and confusion I refused the chest x-ray. I eventually felt back to normal after a few hours, but the past few days following that while I have been in drug detox my blood pressure has been incredibly low and I have been a little uncoordinated and stumbling around, just very lethargic in general. At first I thought it was just how I reacted to the narcan and the precipitated withdrawals but now I am concerned that I may have had some sort of a stroke or mini stroke after reflecting and digging a little deeper into it. I am a regular caffeine and nicotine user and don\'t engage in a whole lot of physical activity. Please help by giving me any feedback, thoughts or suggestions. Thank you!'"

About 8 months ago he had a metastatic tumor removed from his brain which led to his cancer diagnosis. He then underwent directed radiation therapy on the part of his brain where the tumor had been, followed by starting Keytruda and chemotherapy. He finished chemo, is still undergoing the immunotherapy, and started another round of directed radiation, this time on his lymph nodes. Over the past month and a half he was feeling great and even returned to work part time at his construction job. \n\nLast night on his way out of the house to go to dinner with my mom he stopped dead in his tracks, sat down in a chair, and lost all ability to speak. He was rushed to the emergency room, then to another bigger hospital from there and they are now saying that the seizures were a result of brain swelling, but they don't know what the cause is. My question(s) to you all is this: how likely is this to be infusion-related if he hasn't had any side effects previously? I'm aware that brain swelling is an incredibly rare side effect (less than 1%) and there was a week of time between his last infusion and the incident last night. If not a side effect of the drug, what could potentially be the reason for this very sudden severe symptom?"""

Bruises seem to randomly appear mainly on my forearm and I usually only notice when Im wearing short sleeves and looking in the mirror when brushing my teeth. Occasionally Ill get one on top of one of my hands, on top of my foot, or inner thigh. Im never covered in them, its typically one or two at a time and I can go ages and not notice any. Im definitely not banging into anything prior to them appearing. Im not even sure if bruise is the right way to describe them. Theyre more brown or reddish brown than black and blue. Not tender at all. Ive had bloodwork done and dont recall everything that was checked but my doc ruled out clotting disorders. Typically my bloodwork is normal except for slightly low lymphocytes which is an expected side effect of Ocrevus. Same when on previous tx Gilenya. Onset of bruising was prior to Ocrevus and I cant recall if it started before or after starting Gilenya. \nMy iron and ferritin tends to dip a bit so I do take Ferrasorb to stay in the normal range. Ive had no bleeding issues eg gums, and if I get a cut I heal quickly. \nNot sure if related but In 2016 I had my first episode of a lacy rash on my arms which comes and goes. No cause for this was ever determined. \n\nFamily history of breast cancer, lung cancer, CV disease, Type 2 diabetes. My mother did have ITP around age 65, which resolved with treatment.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13mc0jw/33f_rxd_effexor_by_md_i_am_the_mds_scribe_and_x/,b'33F Rxd Effexor by MD (I am the MDs scribe) and X- Ray tech claims he is a terrible doctor for this decision. Please help end this debate?? (details in post)',"b'**TLDR; 33F was prescribed Effexor after trying many other meds for anxiety/depression/mood swings that did not work for her. 28M X-ray tech says that the prescribing MD whom I scribe for is a bad doctor for prescribing her that medication, because it is a horrible med and he (the MD) just wants to make money. Background: The X-ray tech has had a personal bad experience coming off Effexor in the past. Main questions are in bold at the bottom of this post.**\n\n**PT CONTEXT**\nA 33 yo female presented with a history of anxiety and chronic depression, now with the additional symptoms of possible postpartum depression (not explicitly diagnosed but suspected) and increased mood instability. Patient was accompanied by her visibly frustrated husband and 3 young children close in age. Patient was barely interacting with her high energy children, her body was slumped over and she did not hold eye contact well, stared mostly at the floor. She was not lethargic nor suicidal, but visibly stressed/depressed. Her vitals, tox screen, UA, and CBC/CMP/TSH results were all normal.\n\n I do not remember all the psychiatric medications she had trialed already (she was an established patient with the MD but new to me) but stated none of them worked for her, and that she was now presenting absolutely desperate for another option to try. Meds she had tried in the past for the same symptoms include, but are not limited to, several variants of: benzodiazepines, SSRIs, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, SNRIs (other than Effexor), other medications with sedative/mood stabilization effects, as well as holistic approaches and dietary changes. After much research in her charts, I reported to the MD that she had not yet tried Effexor. The MD weighed out what little options he had left, which were few to none, and decided Effexor was an appropriate pick for her otherwise healthy body, current symptoms, and past psych medication experiences with a FOLLOW UP.  After a brief explanation of potential side effects and precautions to be taken, the MD asked if she was comfortable trialing this new (to her) medication and she very clearly consented. MD had me send in Venlafaxine, but we saw so many patients that day I do not remember the starting dose. Knowing the MD, I highly doubt it was a high starting dose. \n\n**X-RAY TECH CONTEXT**\nX-ray tech 28M (lets call him X) is not employed by my facility and has never met this MD, but when speaking to X this female pt interaction came up and i very briefly described the situation without revealing any pt personal info. X admitted bias by explaining his reasoning on why Effexor is the worst anxiety/depression medication ever- X had taken Effexor in the past and admitted it helped him and made him happier, but he felt reliant on it when he decided to stop taking it (unclear if he went cold turkey or tapered) that his withdrawal symptoms were terrible and that it is a horrible medication to prescribe to anyone, just look it up. I tried to explain her history of trialing so many other options, and that medications (especially psychiatric) do not affect everyone the same, and that psych med effectiveness/side effect potentiality can be drastically different depending on the pt. X continued to aggressively push his opinion and even went as far as to say the prescribing MD whom I respect greatly is a terrible doctor that I shouldnt work for based off this one prescription, and that the MD is diagnosing and prescribing incorrectly just to make money. Let me be clear, we have never ever had an Effexor drug rep here, we do not have free samples, and he does not prescribe it often. \n\nPLEASE help me end what has become a nasty debate insulting my place of work, the MD I heavily respect and look up to, and even me for simply looking in her charts for what related psych meds she had not yet been prescribed. I believe I know the answer to some of my questions, but I am not yet a physician so I would like to hear yalls opinions on these questions: \n\n**QUESTIONS**\nDo all psychiatric medications have the same effect, negative or positive, no matter who is taking them? (I know the answer to this one but I plan on showing him the comments here)\n\nIs the MD a bad doctor for prescribing Effexor to a patient with no contraindicative medical history?\n\nis the MD a bad doctor or prescribing improperly just to make a profit for prescribing Effexor (had me send in for the generic, venlafaxine) to a woman desperate for some relief from her 1 complaint of depression, after trying many other types of drugs with little relief beforehand? \n\nis X just an ignorant asshole? X wants to be a PA but after working as an X-ray tech for 4+ years now he has made 0 efforts to continue his education and get his bachelors degree. X also knows I want to be a PA or MD and am actively applying with my completed undergrad degree. X has displayed competitive behavior with me and for some reason also additionally told me that being a scribe was a terrible job and a waste of time, when I have heard the opposite (am still a new scribe) concerning MD or PA school application- that scribing is very good experience for my applications. \n\n\n**Thank you in advance to anyone who reads and replies.**'"

Going on for about three years now. Manifests as sharp pain in penis and increasingly deep burning with occasional tingling in the perineal or deep groin area (lets say behind the testicles), somewhat down my inner thigh as well. It gets worse with sexual stimulation, stretching of the groin and similar things. Sometimes there is a sharp pain with stop/starting urination (like a pain when the ""valve"" switches off and on), but not always. Some minor urinary incontinence.\n\nEdit:\nForgot to mention: Been to ER, urology (multiple), recently an orthopedic surgeon, primary care, pelvic floor physical therapy. They\'ve done most of what you\'d expect. Testicle US, cystoscopy, blood tests, STD tests\n\nHow I\'ve been managing:\nI have struggled greatly with this issue, it can be extremely debilitating at times, and it\'s not clear exactly what the cause is. In the past I have gotten some relief from taking Clonazepam, but my psych took me off of it because I was taking it too much for her liking (0.5 mg about 5 times a week). After being removed from Clonazepam, I fell into alcohol to deal with the pain and it devolved into a real problem. Recently, while detoxing off of alcohol, I\'ve been taking Clonazepam from a friend to help with withdrawals. I\'m managing it very carefully as I know the risk of addiction can be high, but it is safer for me than alcohol and I\'m taking the risk. Not asking a doctor to condone this. \n\nQuestion part:\nI\'ve found that this also helps with my pain to a good extent. I was wondering what a doctor thought about the mechanism at play here with regard to Clonazepam and the pain relief. Are you inclined to believe it\'s just reducing my stress and anxiety and therefore helping the pain, or is it the muscle relaxant effects at work? I have tried Flexeril, but it doesn\'t do much. I am considering asking my doctor for a new type, more potent muscle relaxer (non-addictive of course -- they probably wouldn\'t give me valium with my history with alcohol). Baclofen comes to mind. Any other thoughts on this matter?\n\nExtra detail:\nI have CPPS and recently been detoxing off of alcohol and the pain has spiked horribly. I had a stash of Clonazepam with I was avoiding using. However, out of desperation I took a small amount and it was very helpful for my pain and my withdrawal symptoms. This also helps my pain when I had a legit script and at that time I hadn\'t fallen as hard into alcohol yet.\n\nAnyway for more history, after I lost my original Clonazepam script, I had turned to alcohol as my own source of pain relief and it had spiraled out of control. After many half-hearted attempts, I had a major issue with my relationship and decided to quit. Quit for 10 days and the withdrawals were terrible and made my pain much worse. I ended up in the ER with heart palpitations and other symptoms of a heart issue. Ended up in an inpatient program against my will because I expressed to them that while I wasn\'t exactly acutely suicidal, so many doors have been closing on me with regard to resolving my pain that I had started worrying about more serious suicidal ideations in the future. After 4 days in this so-called voluntary problem, I suffered a lot through the withdrawals and heightened pain, but my pain did get slowly better and more manageable, but it is still somewhat volatile. I was detoxing without drug therapy except for something to manage my spike in blood pressure. In the end I am happy I ended up there since it gave a time where I could take medical leave and not worry about work, while also being forced to abstain from alcohol.\n\nSince I\'ve been out, I relapsed again on a day or two binge due to a subsequent spike in my pain. So where I\'m at is detoxing again, not as bad as the first time which put me in the hospital. As I said above, I\'m managing the pain and withdrawals myself with Clonazepam. I\'m very careful not to take these on the same day. I only take clonazepam on days where I haven\'t been drinking and I\'m starting to feel withdrawals. I know most won\'t be convinced and say this is unsafe, which is fair, but it\'s a calculated risk to maintain my sanity, manage my pain, and to keep the withdrawals at a manageable level. I was wondering what people\'s thoughts were with regard to how and why this is working for my pain?\n\nThanks'"

I am looking for some guidance or recommendation of how to manage the situation with my grandma, who is 85 years old, long time tobacco smoker, slightly overweight, living in an elderly care for many years now.\n\nPrevious and current health issues: She had a **stroke** when she was \\~41 years old (walking issues + issues using one hand - she in on a wheelchair since I remember). Since that time she is taking **medication for her heart pressure**. Lately she is having issues with **gout**. She also have issues with **incontinence.**\n\nCurrent (official) daily medication:\n\n* Alopurinol belupo 100 mg (1x)\n* Amlewel 8 mg (1x)\n* Coupet 40 mg (1x)\n* Ezoleta 10 mg (1x)\n* Glurenorm 30 mg (3x)\n* Mirzaten 30 mg (1x)\n* Naklofen 75 mg (2x)\n* Sanval 10 mg (1x)\n\nWhen needed, she also takes:\n\n* Analgin 500 mg (3x)\n* Doreta 37,5 mg (1x)\n* Lekadol 500 mg (1x)\n* Lexaurin 1,5 mg (1x)\n* Naklofen 75 mg (1x)\n* Seldiar 2 mg (3x)\n\n*On Tuesday (May 23rd)* last week, my grandma was rushed into the hospital early in the morning, because she was having issues **breathing, with diarrhea, vomiting, fast heart rate, anxiety, ""gurgling"" in her lungs and feeling nauseated**. It was a surprise to us all, since she didn\'t complain of any issues a day earlier. They ran some tests in the hospital, while she was being connected to a nasal cannula for oxygen. Her blood results weren\'t concerning to doctors and everything seemed pretty much ok, except *leukocytes which were slightly elevated*. Doctors weren\'t sure what exactly was happening to her and to our surprise they labeled her with bronchitis and gave her IV antibiotics.\n\n*On Friday (May 26th)* she called my dad (her son) and asked him, if he can bring her wheelchair to her place where she lives (elderly care). My dad was surprised she was already emitted home, because he was being regularly updated from the elderly care and the hospital of any changes. He called the elderly care to get more information about her arrival, her current state and medical report. They told him that his mother is not there yet and she is still in the hospital. My dad decided to go to the hospital to see what is happening. When he arrived, he asked her why she lied to him that she was already at home and being emitted, on what she whispered to him ""Shhh! I told this only to you!"". She acted weird, like she was having tripping. Unfortunately, my dad didn\'t say anything to any nurse or any doctor and went home.\n\n*On Saturday (May 27th)* she was being released from the hospital and my dad visited her in her elderly care home. This day she was acting even weirder - she was explaining to my dad that her room-mate was using a remote controller and she was able to control if spiders or lizards were coming our of the walls; and that her room-mate almost hanged herself (as suicide) on the lamp, but the nurse distracted them too early. Again, my dad didn\'t say anything to anyone and went home.\n\n*Yesterday (May 28th)* my uncle called the nurse that works in the elderly care for medical report from the hospital, so that we can check all drugs she got there. My uncle also explained to her that something is going on with his mother. The nurse confirmed him that she has seen that his mother sometimes is acting very, very strange, but the next day, she is back to normal as nothing ever happened. The nurse later checked my grandma\'s room when my grandma was out and she found unprescribed\\* pills in her drawer - Palexia (unfortunately she didn\'t mention the dosage). We are assuming she got it from someone living in the same Elderly care (""house-mate"").\n\nAll this being said, we are now trying to figure out how to manage this situation.\n\n1. Does anyone has any idea to whom to even talk to? I checked side effects from Palexia and all her symptoms that she had on *Tuesday (May 23rd)*, except ""gurgling"" in lungs, match side effects.\n2. This makes us thinking that she might be overusing Palexia and due to higher concentrations getting side effects. Does this seem reasonable? Could it also cause hallucionations?\n\n\\*In our country we are tracking what is prescribed or is not with a health insurance card, so everything is tracked.

That morning on the drive to the caverns, I had been feeling like I was going to have a panic attack and had taken a 0.5mg Xanax I keep on hand for panic attacks to counteract it.\n\nOnce the tour of the caverns began, I remember being a bit unsteady and stumbling at one point but regaining my balance. As for the rest of it... I have no memory. Like I said, the group heard a noise, turned around, and I was on the ground seizing. Seizure lasted approximately 30-45 seconds. EMS was called and I had another seizure in route that did not require any medication to break. Once in the ER, I experienced a third that lasted 30-45 seconds that was terminated with Ativan. I was experiencing sinus tachycardia as well, hovering around 130. ( per my notes: ""sinus tachycardia with preserved intervals and no evidence of obvious toxic effect"") I also remained tachy after falling asleep. Per my hospital notes, I told the ER staff my vision had been altered/my vision had been flashing at one point during the panic attack I thought I was having. I was also very nauseous and apparently vomited at some point and was given several IV doses of Zofran.\n\nI take my zoloft at night, but take my wellbutrin and abilify in the AM. The ER doctor suspected I may have accidentally taken an extra dose of Wellbutrin. Head CT was clear, labs were unremarkable other than I was dehydrated. I was given several saline boluses. I have no history of seizures nor any family history of seizures and take gabapentin for interstitial cystitis and decided to take quite a bit of extra that day due to experiencing a flare-up. I have been on gabapentin for 14 years or so and have taken high doses before with no issues and if I understand correctly, gabapentin also works as an anti-convulsant.My memory from that day and the days after it is shot. I flew home to Florida and here I am. I\'m pretty sore, my face is scraped up and my cheek bone hurts quite a bit. I\'ve got a black eye. I\'m working on getting a referral to a neurologist so I can get checked out, but I wanted to get some opinions on here. It\'s certainly possible I took an extra dose of Wellbutrin but...I\'m so careful about that stuff. I used to be a pharmacy tech... I feel like I pay extra attention, you know? The ER gave me a script for 500mg Keppra BID. I HATE IT. I\'ve skipped taking it a few times, as irresponsible as that is. But I feel it\'s making me very tired, depressed, and irritable.\n\nI called my psychiatrist\'s office today and let them know what had happened. If it were epilepsy starting, it probably wouldn\'t have been three seizures in a row, right? Or is that irrelevant? My psychiatrist ordered me to immediately stop taking it and I\'m on her cancellation list to get in to see her. I got a neurology referral from my PCP and their office will be contacting me on Monday to get an appointment set up.\n\nNote: In case it\'s of any importance, I had some imaging done of my upper back/shoulder in 2007/2008 and it was accidentally discovered that I have ""borderline"" arnold chiari malformation.

My heart started racing and I was going from feeling hot and cold. I started panicking and rushed to the Emergency Room.

My symptoms are debilitating and as I get older, life is demanding more of me. I can\'t keep up. \n\nI told my doctor all this and he seemed stumped. Today he gave me a muscle relaxer for ""better sleep."" I sleep fine. I need pain relief. I asked if there are any other options and he basically said no (I don\'t want to try gabapentin for family history reasons, plus it\'s so similar to pregabalin anyway. He doesn\'t want me on it either).\n\nI asked him about medical cannabis. It\'s legal here, even at my age. He insultingly said ""smoke as much weed as you want,"" and ""do whatever you want."" I\'m not trying to get stoned. He doesn\'t think it\'s ""all that"" and they don\'t reccomend cards at his practice anyway. I don\'t think it\'s all that either, but the drugs I\'ve been told really are ""all that"" either did fuck all or made me trip.\n\nI guess I\'m asking: what are my actual options at this point? This isn\'t pain I can stand anymore, and I\'m doing everything else damn near perfect. I should feel healthy.\n\nIs it worth it to spend hundreds of dollars to even START the process of getting a card? Especially with my previous reactions to non-psychoactive stuff? Thoughts on kratom?\nIs there some perscription out there that works for fibro patients I\'m not aware of?\nIf I really am out of options, to know why I hallucinate so easy off seemingly tame anti-depressants would be cool too.\n\nThank you.'"

My dermatologist has put me on doxycycline for 3 months. I took my first pill today at roughly 12 pm, with food and a large glass of water, as directed by my dermatologist. However, I am experiencing an upset stomach, and diarrhea. I have already had to use the bathroom 3 times today. Only the last time was diarrhea. My dermatologist did tell me that gastrointestinal upset would be a common side effect of of this drug. I am currently not experiencing any other side effects, as far as I can tell. Is this normal? Will my body get used to it over the course of the 3 months? Or is it a cause of concern? Thank you in advance.'"
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13c09is/19m_feel_like_i_had_an_incomplete_puberty/,"b'19M, feel like I had an incomplete puberty'","b'19M, United States, 5\'2, 105lb, white, weird lack of physical maturity, no current medicine, don\'t drink, smoke, or use drugs.\n\nHello everyone. I come here to ask if any of you can give me insight into what is going on with me. For context, I am a 19-year-old white gay cis male from the US. My issue is that I feel like I never physically matured completely. I will list the reasons why:\n\n* **My height is 5 foot 2 inches (157cm).** This is in the bottom 1-2% of adult men in the US. One could say that I might just be one of those 1-2%, but the thing is, I am shorter than both of my parents (dad is 5\'6 (168cm), mom is 5\'3 (160cm)), which is extraordinarily rare for an adult male. I never expected to be tall or even average height but to be an adult male that is shorter than both parents raises some questions.\n* **My frame is very small.** I am also in the bottom 2% of men in terms of frame, my wrist circumference is like 6 inches, my waist and chest sizes are also very small (chest circumference is 33 inches (84cm), waist circumference is 28 inches (71cm)), etc. I also weigh 105 pounds (48kg). The worst thing is that most adult men have a head-to-shoulder ratio of about 1 to 3, meaning that the distance from shoulder to shoulder is three times the width of their head. My ratio is about 1 to a bit under 2.5, meaning that I have a very small shoulder width even relative to my already small proportions. If you\'re wondering, I wear Youth XL shirts.\n* **My voice sounds very weird.** I don\'t know how to describe it, it\'s definitely not like the deep voices I hear from most young adult men, but it\'s also not prepubescent. I have been called ""ma\'am"" on the phone multiple times over the past several years, but I would describe it more like a young teenager with a small voice.\n* **I have very little facial hair.** I can go weeks without shaving and only grow a very light mustache. I also cannot grow a beard at all. I know a lot of men say they cannot grow a beard, but like I literally only have a few small whiskers after weeks.\n\nI know I should probably ask a medical professional about this, I just figured it would be easier to ask online. It is worth mentioning that I took several different medicines from when I was about 7 years old to just a few years ago for ADHD (I have heard that those can possibly stunt growth, but I\'ve also heard that they have no effect). As a result, I had a moderately low appetite during my teenage years due to the medicine. Also worth mentioning is that I had a somewhat early puberty, and I also mostly finished puberty around 14 years old. If I recall correctly, when I was 15 years old I was 5 foot 0.5 inches (154cm), and now at the age of 19 I am 5 foot 2 inches on a good day, my point is I did most of my growing at least 5 years ago. Lastly I have noticed that I have always had a very high metabolism, so if I had an already low appetite paired with a high metabolism, that might be a factor.\n\nHowever there are some things that aren\'t an issue for me. For example, I have a slightly above-average penis (5.75 inches (14.5cm) long), I have hair in many places you would expect (legs, genitals, armpits, etc), and my foot size is weirdly one of the few things about me that is within the realm of normal (they are still on the smaller side, but I wear size 8.5 mens shoes). I know there are some people that don\'t go through puberty and/or have low testosterone, but the fact that I have a normal-sized penis, can ejaculate, and have hair on my legs and armpits leads me to believe that is not the case for me (I might have lower testosterone, but not to the degree that they have).\n\nTo wrap up, I am wondering if any of you can remotely relate (I look around on Reddit and the closest I can find is men my height, but they still have adult bodies, there really isn\'t anyone that is relateable), and if anyone has any advice/explanation/etc, please let me know. I just hate looking like a 12-year-old and not ever being able to experience being a man. It was mostly fine when I was in middle school and high school, because even at 17 there are still guys who are very late bloomers, so I wasn\'t that out of place. But now I am an adult, and I do look very out of place in public. And I realize that if any of this can be ""fixed"", it won\'t be everything, because your growth plates close when puberty ends, but I have heard that trans men that take testosterone see their voice permanently deepen.\n\nTL;DR: 19-year-old guy is stuck in a young teenager\'s body, 5\'2, very small frame, weird voice. I took ADHD meds for a while, had an early puberty that ended when I was 14. It\'s weird because I do have some elements of my body that did mature, but others that really didn\'t.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13ku6yr/why_do_so_many_hospitals_treat_their_patients/,b'Why do so many hospitals treat their patients horribly?',"b'Back in December, I witnessed an increidbly emotionally traumatic incident that involved the very brutal and horrific death of a beloved pet. I don\'t handle stress well, so the trauma and stress caused me to become violently ill, to the point I couldn\'t walk and was barely conscious. I had gone to the urgent care, and they gave me oral medication for the vomiting that I couldn\'t keep down because of said vomiting. I ended up having to be taken to the ER by my 82 year old great grandma, and the receptionist was horrible to the both of us. \n\nI was deathly pale, being wheeled around in a wheelchair by my elderly great-grandma who has a hard time walking herself, and I was shivering and passing out in between vomiting. The receptionist made me wait six hours in the waiting room and got sh\\*tty with my GGM when she had the *audacity* to ask her for a blanket for me because of my shivering. She made me wait an hour for a really thin, ratty blanket and snapped at my GGM when she had to ask a second time for the blanket. About four hours in, my GGM asked what was taking so long for me to be seen, because I was getting increasingly worse and wasn\'t able to stay conscious and was just laying in the chair in severe pain. She snapped at my GGM that I ""Wasn\'t a priority"" and continued to make me wait. \n\nWhen I was finally seen, the nurse that was treating me was horrified. She was setting up an IV line to get a blood sample and provide me fluids, and I was so dehydrated that I barely got enough urine out for a sample. She explained to me that I certainly *was* a priority because of how dehydrated I was, and that I should have been sent back hours before because of the state I was in. She was extremely kind, and she tried to make me as comfortable as possible. She gave me as many blankets as I wanted, and tried to manage the abdominal pain with some standard medication. \n\nI really think the receptionist thought I was some kind of junkie looking for a fix, I can certainly understand why she would think that considering how I looked with the paleness, the vomiting, and the passing out. But I wasn\'t the only person she was treating like that. There was a lady who came in because she was diabetic (I overheard her husband talking to the receptionist) and she ended up passing out. The only reason she was seen immediately was because, when she passed out, her head slammed into the floor before her husband could catch her. Even then, the receptionist was awful and nearly yelled ""Alright, I *guess* you guys can go back now."" There were other people in there that had been waiting longer than I did. I was in the hospital for a total of 9 hours, 6 in the waiting room, and 3 in the actual ER receiving fluids and medication. I ended up so bad that I had to take the week off work to recover because the dehydration had made me so weak I had a hard time standing up for longer than a few minutes. \n\nEven so, I wasn\'t even asking for meds, I just wanted the vomiting to stop so I could actually rest. That illness was worse than the time I actually had alcohol poisoning, and I hadn\'t even had anything to drink before or after the traumatic incident. \n\nI\'ve heard so many horror stories of patients being dismissed and treated like trash because medical providers just think they\'re drug seekers looking for a fix, when the patient is actually having a real problem that needed to be looked at. This isn\'t the first time I\'ve been treated horribly by a medical professional, and it\'s the reason why I almost never go to the doctor unless it\'s a serious emergency. Before that, I hadn\'t been to the doctor in 3 years aside from when I had a wrist injury, because I was also treated horribly by my PCP when I went to her at 17 years old for chronic migraines. That issue also never got sorted because she just assumed my migraines were caused by depression, and she prescribed me an antidepressant that gave me horrible side effects. When I told her to take me off the meds and run actual tests because of blood clotting issues that run in my family, she increased the dosage, which made me even worse. I\'m talking severe mood swings, extreme aggression, I essentially stopped sleeping, was severely depressed and anxious all the time, and caused severe suicidal thoughts that I nearly acted on multiple times. The cause of my migraines still haven\'t been solved, and I\'ve had them for 7 years now. \n\nOverall, why are medical professionals so horrible to their patients? It makes no sense to me. I always remember being treated very well as a child, because I had a chronic illness as a child that slowly went away as I got older. But ever since I became a teenager and now into my early 20\'s, I\'ve been treated horribly by most medical professionals I\'ve seen. I don\'t do any sort of drugs, and I drink in extreme moderation after the alcohol poisoning thing. Every single friend I have has been dismissed by doctors. I have a friend who was told her nose was fine, when in fact is was very much broken and had to be re-broken to repair it. Another friend who had severe abdominal pain that they dismissed and still hasn\'t been resolved, and yet another friend who was treated like garbage after getting her IUD implant and then the facility she had it done at tried to commit insurance fraud by saying she didn\'t have insurance, when she did, and tried to make her pay out of pocket alongside her insurance payment. This is a huge problem.'"

My mothers blood sugar is WAY out of control',"b'Hello, I\'m a bit desperate so I thought posting here would help. My mother (57f) is type 2 diabetic and everyday her blood sugar spikes 200+ sometimes hitting over 300, but the thing is this happens when she DOESN\'T eat too. Like, for example the other night her blood sugar dropped at 4am and she ate something to raise it. Then at 7 something when she was driving to work her blood sugar spiked really high. Also today she only ate something small for lunch and then like 5-7 hours later it went over 200. I read some articles that said skipping meals can cause blood sugar spikes (as well as low blood sugar) and she doesn\'t eat regular meals.\r  \n\r  \nOther things that I think might be effecting it: she doesn\'t drink water (like at al, I can\'t get her too no matter how much I try tbh) so she mostly lives on diet pepsi and I read that eating carbs after that might cause blood sugar spikes for some reason? She skips breakfast most of the time, and like I said doesn\'t eat regular meals. She also mostly eats processed foods, but again doesn\'t really eat that much.\n\nShe\'s about 180 pound, 5\'8"", takes some sort of insulin to help control her blood sugar, not sure which kind, and doesn\'t drink smoke, or use recreational drugs.\r  \n\r  \nI guess I\'m just really starting to get worried she\'s going to die because of this, and I need some advice for why it spikes so much, and what I should do to help her control it.'"
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13hi4va/desperate_to_speak_with_someone_who_has/,b'Desperate to speak with someone who has experience treating Selenium Poisoning (Selenosis) and its complications. Would also appreciate general advice.',"b'Back in December of last year I (24M, 5\'10"", 175ish at the time, now 160ish, white/ashkenazi descent) had a severe acute selenium toxicity event as a result of eating way too many Brazil nuts in a day. This was preceded by abnormally high consumption of Brazil nuts on and off for over a year. I was close to perfectly healthy prior to this time, aside from some indicators of existing neurological damage, since I\'ve had a weak sense of smell for a very long time.\n\nThere\'s a lot to describe here, so please excuse some disorganization of thought. I will start with my initial symptoms, the ones that subsided, then move into symptoms that have persisted or are new, before finishing with attempts at treatment. I know it\'s a lot, but I think most of it is relevant, and I will immensely appreciate any advice or input.\n\nDuring the night in question, after returning home from a long hike with my wife, I was playing video games when I heard an odd, out-of-place sound (which was reminiscent of metal scraping against metal) followed shortly thereafter by my blood pressure spiking super high (was around 160/120), accompanied by numbness in both legs that lasted for days, circulation that became terrible for weeks, and my heart rate rose to tachycardia, which has persisted with regularity for months afterwards. At the time it happened, I could feel each heart beat, as my heart pounded very hard. Palpitations outside just a bounding heartbeat were also common, along with some agnia. My digestion was absolutely wrecked as well. Extreme fatigue was common, and sleep was very difficult. I was sweating excessively every night for weeks. I felt detached from my lower body for weeks as well. And, the lymph node along the right underside of my jaw grew very swollen. Leading up to this event, it had a tendency to swell, but I discovered I could make it relax by messaging it.\n\nAbout a week after the initial event, I went to the ER for my symptoms, and was sent home after they did some blood work (which was basically perfectly normal), and an X-ray, which confirmed I did not have a heart attack.\n\nI ultimately went to a cardiologist for my persistent cardiovascular symptoms. He told me he could not find anything wrong with my heart itself, after a proper ECG, listening to my heart, and an ultrasound of my heart, but could definitely tell there was a ""signaling issue."" He said my heart was acting like I was running a marathon, but it seemed completely unnecessary, as there was no actual weakness or scarring. When I told him I could almost always feel my heartbeat, he said he wasn\'t surprised, with how hard and fast my heart was beating. He indicated he thought it would likely get better with time, and did not seem overly concerned, considering I told him the cause was heavy metal poisoning. This made him suggest it was likely temporary. I immediately improved significantly, since this removed a lot of anxiety.\n\nIt did get better in some ways, but some new symptoms came and went. First, I treated the numbness in my legs by using a pedaler. As I pedaled, I noticed that simple numbness was not the only issue, as the muscles in my legs were actually firing incorrectly. As I would pedal, my entire quad, on each leg as I went, would harden fully. Not just the portion of the muscle necessary for the action, but the entire muscle would activate all at once. This particular symptom subsided rather quickly, with a few days of pedaling.\n\nThis was not the only neurological symptom related to my legs, and soon after they developed involuntary movements (which I believe would be considered tremors). They would only ever jolt one at a time, so it wasn\'t persistent involuntary trembling. I would feel a certain pressure that would culminate in a leg jolt, which would then bring a certain relief. It would only ever happen at rest, while sitting or laying. I felt as though I could resist the urge to twitch, but it also felt like allowing my body to relieve itself was more productive. After about a month or two of that, it finally stopped.\n\nI also suffered from something approximating extreme hypnic jerks as I would near sleep, many of which were originating in my torso, and were commonly painful. This went away within the first month or so, and has recently returned, but not as bad.\n\nI suffered from cognitive impairment as well, with sudden bouts of loss of focus and concentration, general difficulty focusing altogether, a sense of detachment from myself and my surroundings, blurry vision, and sensitivity to any unknown or unexpected sounds, which would cause an anxiety response. I presume this was some form of PTSD related to the sound heard during the initial event. My overall tolerance for anxiety was very low, but has significantly improved. Sometimes I\'d feel as though I\'d momentarily blipped out of existence entirely, during moments when all my senses would cut off for a split-second. It\'s difficult to describe, but I mean sound and sight would both leave me, as everything would go true-black and sound would cut out. I\'d also have instances where it almost felt as if my brain lost track of where my eyes were expected to be looking, resulting in momentary disorientation. Most of this has resolved itself, but it was rather extreme for a time.\n\nI\'m unsure if it\'s related to my neurology, but I\'ve also had an odd sensation that builds in my torso, feels like around my diaphragm area, that\'s somewhat like the neurological pressure I\'d feel when my legs wanted to twitch. I am able to ""release,"" for lack of a better word, this sensation, which usually results in some slight tingling in my quads, as if they reach a more relaxed state. It feels necessary to prevent the pressure from building, and it only happens at rest. It\'s feels less common now, but was very prevalent for months.\n\nI did, and still do, suffer from exercise intolerance. I often feel lightheaded after sets when weight training, and my recovery after any exercise is characterized by momentary lapses of focus that don\'t last long enough to place as lightheadedness, but interrupt concentration, and feel not dissimilar to near loss of consciousness. A general feeling of unwellness is also common, post-workout. Recently, there\'s not really been any accompanying fatigue, though. Tachycardia is a constant during weight training, and the heartbeat is easily felt (which I guess is considered palpitations, but that\'s pretty normal for me now). Initially I\'d have skipped beats during cardio, but that has subsided. I only have symptoms post cardio, now.\n\nRegarding cardiovascular symptoms, it takes very little for my heart rate to shoot past 100, rarely going above 120. Palpitations such as skipped beats, or my heart stumbling over itself, are frequent, but have become less so with time. They would happen multiple times per night at first, but that\'s become far less common. Agnia is now uncommon, and usually only accompanies anxiety, when fear for my well-being overcomes me. Interestingly, I don\'t have issues during intense cardio exercise, like rowing, and actually can sustain myself well, the issues happen post-workout. On the other hand, getting up to urinate oftentimes makes my heart beat hard enough to be felt, and can make me temporarily tachycardic.\n\nAs an aside, I have been intermittently having a sensation in my throat that varies from a tickle up to feeling almost as though I\'m choking. I can usually place it as coming around my larynx. I\'m unsure if this is cardio related, as it does not come with tightness in my chest, or shortness of breath. I\'ve not really struggled with much shortness of breath, in general. The sensation does seem to worsen upon exertion, and rarely happens during rest. I do have some scar tissue in my throat from vocal cord damage, as a result of reckless use of my voice, so my throat isn\'t really in the best shape to begin with.\n\nI now have concerns about my kidney/liver (but mostly kidney) health. Roughly a month after my initial toxicity event, I noticed debris in my urine with regularity, almost every time I pee. It\'s usually so miniscule that it\'s only visible when light reflects off the water just right, but there are occasionally larger crystalline structures that are clearly visible, and some that are almost like small clear hairs formed from a chain of particles. The crystals are always clear or white, and never round or perfectly rectangular. Urination is never uncomfortable, and the color is always healthy. Recently, I have developed frequent urethral burning post urination. Intermittently, the burning has been paired with urinary urgency, and occasionally bladder ache.\n\nWhile I do have many issues, amusingly my immunity is doing very well. I was always prone to seasonal allergies, but I\'m not having any significant issues this year.\n\nNow to discuss more recent developments. An attempt at treating my lingering neurological symptoms went quite haywire. At the point I\'m discussing now, I was mostly just suffering from intermittent vision weakness in my left eye which was accompanied by a certain light pressure, like I was having to strain in a particular way with that eye, and I had a recurrent tight muscle in my right eyebrow for seemingly no reason. I perhaps misjudged how well I was doing, since many of my other symptoms had dissipated, and my tachycardia had significantly improved.\n\nEither way, I took psilocybin mushrooms, after hearing for years about how they benefit neurology. My trip was quite pleasant, but it wasn\'t long into it that I developed an intense urinary urgency that would not subside. My urine was a healthy color, so I didn\'t think to consider dehydration, though I should have. I was also sweating from both hands quite a bit, but not necessarily profusely. This was accompanied by a static-y sensation in my left arm, which I chalked up to the mushrooms messing with my brain. Either way, as I came down from my trip, I REALLY felt terrible and became drowsy. I feared falling asleep, and entered into a poor mindset. I grew very detached, and feared drinking water as a result of the intense urinary urgency. My wife tried to keep me engaged by having me hand her screws for a cabinet she was building. I was fixated on how abnormal the screws felt in my static-y left hand. As I continued feeling completely aberrant, it ebbed and flowed until it culminated in me losing consciousness and falling from my chair.\n\nMy wife says I was out for some 10 seconds or so, during which time I could vaguely make out the fact she was calling my name. It was almost like a hazy dream that was comprised of a vague recollection of a childhood memory with her voice echoing my name. I came to and felt extremely bizarre. My facial muscles were very tense, and slightly difficult to control, though this was not noticeable to my wife or anyone else. I also felt as though I could lose consciousness again at any time. I feared a stroke and was taken to the ER by my wife, once again.\n\nAfter a blood test, urinalysis, CT scan, and chest x-ray, I was once again told I was completely normal, and they surmised my loss of consciousness to be a result of dehydration. This time, my heart rate and BP were actually normal as well. No signs of ischemia either. I think they\'re likely right that it was dehydration, though I\'ve also considered this could have been a seizure. This was the first time in my life I\'ve lost consciousness, so I don\'t have much to go on, regarding what is normal for my body. On one hand, I was relieved it wasn\'t a stroke, and on the other I was disappointed at the way things turned out. This disappointment has only mounted over the last month or so since this trip to the ER.\n\nWhile some of my neurological symptoms did improve after the mushroom incident, such as the left eye weakness, new issues have arisen now that have me somewhat perplexed.\n\nOne of the more concerning new developments is random muscle twitches. This time is generally unlike tremors, as the affected body part does not actually move, though I do seem to have the odd tremor here and there, just far less extreme when compared to earlier this year, and this time in more areas of the body than just legs. Generally, a muscle twitches, and usually only a twitch or two before stopping. This only ever happens at rest, and I\'ve not noticed any muscle weakness or cramping. It\'s not just my legs this time, and seems to be potentially any muscle in the body, even torso muscles. Legs do seem like the most common, though. No shaking or unsteadiness anywhere in my body.\n\nI\'ve also developed some actual nerve pain, though it\'s rare, and may have already subsided. Shortly after returning from the ER, a few nights later, I was startled from near sleep by the sensation that my hand had been burnt, almost as if I\'d pressed it against a hot pan. I\'ve not had any other instances as notable as that one, so it may not be cause for concern, but is worth noting.\n\nWhile I\'d noticed the urinary debris for months leading up to the shrooms, the burning urethra post-urination and occasional urinary urgency was nonexistent before the incident. This past week, I had a particularly rough time with burning urethra after I\'d started taking Apple Cider Vinegar before meals, and believe the added acidity to be the cause. The urinary urgency was worse during this time as well. It seems to be improving rather quickly now that I\'ve stopped taking ACV, but it makes me question if my Kidneys could be the cause, since I understand they play a role in regulating acidity in the body and in the urine. I fear the psilocybin incident further damaged my kidneys, though it seems strange to me that my urinalysis and blood work were of no cause for concern, if that was the case. I\'ve also developed odd dry mouth, especially prevalent at night, but also happens occasionally during the day, no matter what level of hydration I\'m at.\n\nFor a few days after returning home, I kept feeling faint, like I could pass out again, but this sensation dissipated eventually.\n\nMy exercise intolerance seems to has worsened, as I have more bouts of lightheadedness during weight training. I had a particularly alarming incident over the last week as well. I\'d been going for long walks recently (1 hourish) at a pace just short of a jog in my neighborhood, which has large hills, adding to the intensity. I\'d been tolerating these well, but then decided to add weight training back into my routine, to assist my neurology, but that seems to have been a mistake.\n\nEarlier this week I rowed for 10 minutes, which didn\'t cause me any problems, and followed up with weight training for about 40 minutes, which made me light headed multiple times throughout. I was mostly okay after the fact, but I could tell my body was a bit sensitive as a result. The next day I decided all I\'d do is a walk, and attempted to do my standard path, but had to cut it short when I started feeling poorly. I returned home and was keenly aware of the fact I was quite tachycardic, and didn\'t feel very good. My at-home EKG confirmed I was around 120BPM, though it dropped slightly below 100 before too long. It continued to sit near 100, likely going above and dipping back below several times, for a few hours. My urethra was burning as well, accompanied by urinary urgency, and frequent urination. Pee was a standard color, and nothing too out of what has become ordinary for me, as far as debris goes. I started going down an internet rabbit hole about kidney problems, which spiked my anxiety and made everything worse. I haven\'t been particularly well since, and may or may not have had Afib a couple days after the walk that resulted in the bout of tachycardia.\n\nWhile I was eating, I felt a particularly funky palpitation, where it was a heavy heartbeat, then a solid couple seconds or so before the next beat. I was also having little bouts of feeling faint, and my heart still felt abnormal, so I went upstairs and took another EKG. I felt my heart stumble a couple times while taking it, so I was curious what it\'d say. It read Afib, which was the first time I\'ve had that result from an EKG. As such, I used a feature of the Kardia app to have a cardiologist review the the chart and make a manual determination, to be certain. Less than an hour later, the cardiologist came back with a determination that it was not afib, and instead Sinus Arrythmia. This helped my anxiety, but I\'ve been plagued by concern that I\'m dying, and that I\'ll leave my wife without my support. My tachycardia has been particularly bad the last few days, thought not as bad as was common closer to the inital onset of symptoms. Anxiety is very much an influencing factor right now. I\'ve been rather sensitive to anxiety, and have had difficulty controlling my anxiety since the initial toxicity event.\n\nI do have some points in my favor, which I will cover after I discuss my attempts at treatment.\n\nFor self-treatment, I first investigated the possibility of chelation. I quickly learned that non-natural chelators are rough on the body, so I investigated natural alternatives. I was desperate for a solution, since my digestive system had basically given up the ghost, as I was passing food I had eaten some 6 hours prior, and my blood sugar felt super unstable. I read about cilantro and chlorella as options for chelation. It was going to take a minute for chlorella to arrive, so I tried eating dried cilantro.\n\nThe night I had the cilantro is the night a week after the initial incident that sent me to the ER for the first time. I felt like I was having a heart attack, and even had some numbness in my lips. I was told I was fine, and sent home, but my digestive issues made me worry a blood sugar induced heart attack was on the table. I\'ve never had blood sugar issues, so I was somewhat reaching for any kind of understanding for what I was feeling. I had another similar incident a couple days later, but I just toughed it out, since I didn\'t want another horrific ER bill, just to be told I was fine again.\n\nMy chlorella arrived, and it dramatically improved my digestion, and overall well-being, almost immediately. That began my journey to recovering digestive health. I was intolerant to several staple foods of my diet, after the toxicity incident, but I\'ve since regained a state of consistently good digestion. I am not on any pharmaceuticals, nor do I have much interest in taking any, considering the cost, and the fact that I can\'t be sure how they\'d interact with my unique circumstance.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of my toxicity, when I realized it was selenium poisoning, I sought to eliminate all selenium from my diet, if only temporarily. This resulted in a radical diet shift that compounded my digestive issues at the time, since I avoided meat and eggs. As my symptoms improved, I added most of my staple foods back in, with the exception of Brazil nuts, which I now staunchly believe should never be consumed by man. I also added in organ meats, as I know they are extremely nutritious. I also have been taking lion\'s mane mushroom extract, which I definitely believe has helped fix some of my resolved neurological symptoms. I\'ve added in milk thistle, to support my urinary system, and nattokinase, to lower the likelihood of a clot. Despite all this, I now find myself questioning every decision I\'ve made along the way, with my current health. Even so, I cannot deny that I am significantly better off now than I was a few months ago. I just feel like I may be backsliding.\n\nI feel uncertain in all regards. I am unsure to what degree I\'ve damaged my heart and kidneys. I am unsure of the biological mechanism by which they have been damaged, so planning further treatment is difficult. Should I attempt to cut more selenium out of my diet again? If I do so, and it\'s not necessary, that will just degrade my diet and make any organ failure worse. I\'ve been losing weight as a result of my inability to weight train, does this mean that I may just be shedding more selenium, and need to give it time? I\'ve become accustomed to the feeling of selenium toxicity (there\'s a distinct feeling in abdominal region) and I\'ve not felt like that since the last time I attempted heavy chelation a bit over a month ago.\n\nI fear taking cilantro tincture and chlorella a month ago, to detox, may have placed more stress upon my organs, despite the chlorella theoretically helping to mitigate that.\n\nAnd, despite all my concerns about organ damage, I don\'t really have all that many symptoms of organ damage, currently. I\'ve never been a drinker. No swelling in hands or feet. No lethargy or tiredness. I actually feel pretty damn good a lot of the time, whenever I\'m not freaking out or recovering from exercise. No kidney pain. No cold-like symptoms, sweats, or fever. Circulation is often good, now. I don\'t sleep great, but I do get sleep each night. Libido is good, and erectile function is normal. I just have a couple difficult symptoms that could be tied to organ damage, like the heart function abnormalities and urinary abnormalities. Not to mention the clear nerve damage. I just know I\'m victim of an underlying cause that absolutely has the potential to wreck kidneys, heart, liver, and neurology. I was a heavy weed user over the last few years, but it was mostly dry herb vape, which, while not optimal, is definitely the lesser evil amongst inhalable options. I stopped as soon as the toxicity event occurred.\n\nMy diet is very nutritionally dense. I\'ve improved it since the toxicity event, but it was always much better than is common here in the US. I\'ve now been eating a combination of sprouted whole grains, seeds, nuts (not Brazil), veggies, sprouts, greens, onion, garlic, bell pepper, meats, eggs, and organ meats. I am sure this would be a good diet for any healthy person, but I\'m starting to question if it\'s the best thing for me currently. If it\'s not, I\'m somewhat at a loss as to what adjustments I should make, especially since I don\'t even know precisely what the state of my well-being is.\n\nI\'m just not sure what to think, especially after being told I\'m all good 3 times now, and the rarity of the underlying cause of my affliction. Selenosis is very rare in humans, and there seems to be exceedingly little research on its effects and treating it. I\'ve tried searching for any kind of specialist with experience treating Selenosis, but no dice. I don\'t care if it\'s MD, naturopath, or homeopath, I just want to consult with someone who has some actual experience with my specific problem. Organ damage caused by selenium poisoning isn\'t quite the same as damage caused by congenital problems or drug use. What little info I was able to scrape together from scientific journals seems to imply it can actually alter the very composition of organs, in the right dosages over a long period of time. I\'m not sure how to contend with that. And the doctors I\'ve spoken with, who\'ve never even heard the term ""Selenosis,"" definitely don\'t know how to handle this.\n\nThis situation has kind of wrecked my whole family. Everyone is worried, both about my well-being and about paying for my healthcare. I blame myself entirely, and honestly kind of hate myself for being careless and getting myself into this situation. The idea of leaving my wife behind is unthinkable. We\'ve been joined at the hip since we met at 18, and we can\'t imagine life without each other. The stress of this has already done a number on her health, and I am certain she\'ll end up going with me, if I can\'t pull through. I just can\'t let that be the end result of our relationship. That\'s too tragic to be acceptable. So, I really need some advice here on how to proceed, and how I might find a professional who has experience dealing with Selenosis. If any of you know someone who has actual knowledge of my condition, please refer me to them. I am going back to my Cardiologist in about 10 days, and I am looking into seeing a Urologist, to pin down the source of my urinary abnormalities, but I still want to speak with an expert on Selenosis, if at all possible. I feel a neurologist would just drain my bank account without being able to offer any real solutions, so I\'m avoiding that for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to ask any questions, I will be monitoring this post closely.'"

My prior authorization expires next month. Its good for a full year, and i have filled 12 times for 360/365 days. Pharmacy fills my prescription 2.5 days early each month. 2.5 x 12 = 30 extra days of medication. The thing is, I am always overlapping days each month.

Xyrem and Sunosi help me wake up easier in the morning, but the effects only last so long, and i am basically screwed if i dont have Adderall to help me through the day. Without it, i am asleep. I asked my doctor to prescribe IR adderall as a short term alternative, just so i could get through the month and he refuses. I am absolutely terrified that i am going to fall asleep while driving or taking care of my kids. I always take my medication as prescribed, and honest to god, i have no idea how this happened. My only guess is that i take an extra Adderall some days when i am ultra sleepy, because i had forgotten that i already taken one. My doctor advised that i make my remaining RX and the 5 day supply last, and that i have sunosi/xyrem to ""hold me over"". The thing is, have been TRYING SO HARD to make my Adderall last, and its almost impossible. I get so fricken tired and crabby, so I have to take my medication as prescribed. My doctor said that he wont prescribe any extra medication. I absolutely understand that it is a controlled substance. I am a pharmacy technician, and i can see how this probably looks. But i feel helpless and hopeless, and i feel like i am being treated like some kind of drug seeker. So anyway, am i completely screwed for an entire month or is there anything i can possibly do in order to feel functional? Do i keep asking around? I just feel so lost.\n\nThank you.'"

As I write this, Im sitting in a closed off room with a mask on and an air purifier running.\n\nBetween my childhood & 21, I took Piriton everyday, which was very effective, however over recent years its effectiveness has plummeted, I assume my body has built up some sort of tolerance. Due to this Ive been trying different drugs over the years, Loratadine (ineffective) & most recently Cetirizine, which I find to be effective, but only for 6-10 hours of the day.\n\nIt was suggested to me over the weekend that I could try injections to treat it. Ive had a bit of a Google and see that Kenalog is used to treat hayfever and similar conditions. Ive seen loads of people rave about it, but Ive also seen that the NHS used to offer this treatment but pulled it. I also see on the other hand, that many private clinics where Im from (Scotland) offer it as a treatment. \n\nI guess what Im here to ask is:\n\n1) Is this a viable treatment method?\n\n2) why was it pulled in the UK from the NHS?\n\n3) is this something I should consider?\n\n4) any other treatment suggestions are welcome\n\nMany thanks in advance!!'"

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/143cihj/random_nosebleeds/,b'Random nosebleeds',"b'Hello, dear Doctors of Reddit! \n\nI (21NB) started bleeding from my nose maybe two months ago. Most of them weren\'t full on nosebleeds, but rather the smell of iron and the feeling of a clogged nose, though my nose wasn\'t actually clogged. \n\nDuring the second one I was drinking, so I don\'t really know if that had anything to do with it. I\'ve never reacted to alcohol in any way, other than the classic dizziness and nausea. \n\nSince around mid April, my nose has bled maybe **three (3) times a week**, sometimes being a full on nosebleed, others as I described earlier. I\'ve woken up in a panic because of bleeding, I\'ve gotten it while in the bathroom, sitting at my desk and writing, laying down and watching YouTube etc. It can happen anytime, wherever, whenever. \n\nIn my **past**, it has been rather rare of me to start bleeding, and I was a fairly careful child. I had a fear of blood as a toddler and would faint at even the mention of it. There have been times in my teens where I\'d just started bleeding, but usually it was caused by something.\n\nAs far as my **physical health**, I\'m rather not updated than anything. I struggled a lot with anxiety and depression as a pre-teen throughout my teens, and have recently been diagnosed with autism. Due to this, I\'ve also been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. \n\nAs for **medication**, I\'ve been on Sertraline since March, and have not had any side effects before, though I guess my nosebleeds started right after my phychiatrist told me to go all the way up to **200mg**. \n\nI also take vitamins as I\'m deficient of both B12 and D. In the past I also had severe iron deficiency. Last time I got checked was late March, early April this year, and other than my vitamin D levels, everything was normal. I have taken my supplements daily along my meds since I got them.\n\nAs a child I was, and still am **overweight**, and by the obesity chart I\'m severely obese. I don\'t know my weight, but I\'d guess around 120kg, or 265 lbs, and I\'m 5\'\'11. I\'m a caucasian Norwegian. \n\n**I don\'t do drugs** and never have, but I do drink on occasion. Last time was at the end of April, before that I think maybe X-mas, or Halloween. I do also smoke, but that is rather rare. I do use tobacco though, we call it ""snus"", which is a little felt pouch filled with tobacco that you put under your lip. I been addicted to snus since the beginning of 2018. I\'ve heard it\'s illegal and counted as drugs in America, but in Norway it\'s just age restricted, like regular cigarettes. \n\nI do not have any pictures to provide, as well as the fact that I want to be as anonymous as I can and would rather not share my face online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\'m writing this today as I had a full on nosebleed, still bleeding actually, along with a troubled stomach and some hip pains (though my hip pain is probably my Fibromyalgia). \n\nDo ask for more information if I missed something, and I will post an update!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Any ideas as to why I keep getting nosebleeds?

At that point the hospital neurologist wasn\'t sure what the ""lesion"" was on my MRI and ran tests for MS along with the full stroke workup. I had a terrible spinal tap which resulted in a leak that started before I was even out the door of the hospital.

Some days it\'s a dull pressure and some days it\'s enough to make me nauseous.

Ive lurked for quite a while and the amount of selfless help I see here on this sub is heart warming. \n\nAfter all of the amazing feedback Ive seen here, was hoping you all may be able to shed some light on whats (potentially) happening with my father. For context, hes 62. No health issues aside from high cholesterol. He took medication for the past 20 years but has recently stopped due to side effects and is trying to address it with lifestyle changes. He doesnt smoke or do any drugs and never has. He drinks on occasion, maybe a few times a year and usually only a few drinks. Im not sure if this is necessary info but hes had surgery for a deviated septum, a torn meniscus (knee), and also back surgery to address some slipped and shattered disks. I believe that is all in terms of medical history but feel free to ask follow up questions.\n\nRecently, he went for a general wellness check up and upon taking his blood pressure, the results were VERY concerning to the nurse. They decided to take those vitals from his other arm and the results were normal. They decided to retest on each arm once more and one arm has normal BP reading and the other had very high and concerning readings. Apologies that I cant be more specific. English is my fathers second language so his iteration of the events isnt super specific or technical. Upon this discovery the doctor advised he got for follow up tests immediately as they thought he could have some kind of blood clot or issue with his heart. He had transthoracic echo with dobbler done, and the results seem to identify some issues found, and areas that could not be properly examined. The doctor, however, told him that everything is normal and never gave any explanation for the results or strange BP reading. Out of an abundance of caution, I am hoping that docs of Reddit can check the results and provide second opinions. Typically, my father is very trusting of his medical team; however, he just switched providers and doesnt have great medical coverage, etc. so all of this has left him uneasy. I was unable to copy and paste the results, so Ill link them in a comment below.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to check this out. I look forward to hearing your feedback!'"

Approximately 508 and weight about 165 pounds.\n\nI was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and have struggled with maintaining healthy sleeping habits for most of my life.  I drink occasionally, but almost never in excess.  I sometimes do marijuana and recently have been trying to quit as I think it just increases my anxiety more than help it.  I dont smoke any cigarettes or do any forms of tobacco.  Sometimes, when I am with one of my friends and when he offers, I will do some chewing tobacco, but thats is very rare.\n\nI try to follow a balanced diet most of the time.  I eat a lot of nuts, whole grains, and fruits.  I can probably use more vegetables.  I try to stay away from most processed foods.  I try to follow an intermittent fasting style of eating.  I drink a lot of water too and consume black coffee, but lately Ive been cutting back on the coffee.  I drink a lot of herbal teas too.  Mostly something with ginger in it.\n\nI go to a boxing gym and have been boxing for the past 12 yrs or so.  I compete too.  I go to the gym probably 2 - 4 times a week and I occasionally run, although I used to run a lot more than I used to.\n\nWithin the past few months, I have been having chest pains.  It started last December.  I checked myself into the ER and all tests came back negative.  Just this past month in April, I started getting chest pains again, this time more intense.  They felt different.  It lasted a few days.  I got full blood work done, and I did a nuclear stress test and everything came back normal.\n\nNow it started again within the past few days.  Again.  They feel more intense.  The pain will move around my midsection.  Generally, the pain will move around my left side.  Itll feel like my heart and chest is full and sometimes, my heart directly will hurt as it beats.\n\nNow, what troubles me is that when I go running, Ill get discomfort in my upper right chest.  Itll feel like theres something squeezing when I breathe in and out and Ill have to stop running.  \n\nNow itll sometimes happen when I am walking around at work and I feel like I need to sit down.  These new sensations started maybe 3 days ago.\n\nI am prescribed seroquel at 25 mg for sleep, but Ill have to double or triple the dose for it to be effective.  I am also on buspirone for anxiety at 7.5 mg twice daily.  I take creatine supplements.  Very rarely, Ill take phenobarbital supplements for the purposes of sleeping.  Most any kind of drug that I do take, I like it to be sedating in nature to help aid in sleeping.  Most nights it will take me an hour, 2, or 3 hours to fall asleep.  It almost feels like my brain actively fights sleeping.\n\nI set up an appointment with the psychiatrist to see if I can get off of these meds or switch them.  My sleep has been very poor the past few months.  Most nights I get 6 hrs or less.  Almost never will I get more than 7.  I also set an appointment up with a regular physician.\n\nDespite all of this, I have still remained active at the gym.  Last week I even sparred 3 rounds.  That was about 6 days ago.\n\nAll of my tests that I have done thus far has come up negative, so part of me feels like this is my anxiety, but the symptoms are concerning.'"

How can I bring my problems to my doctor attention without it being defaulted to the birth control or bust lecture?\n\n\nBefore I start this, I cant take birth control due to side effects (mentioned below), and I have extremely painful periods and its been continuously brushed off. I genuinely dont know where else to ask this or even really vent it. \nMy entire life Ive had pretty bad periods. They started off as heavy and mildly painful then I went on birth control. My periods lightened but the pain never diminished for the 10+ years I took the pill. \nI came off the pill around 2018/2019 because I was sick of the other side effects I was gaining (specifically the psychiatric side effects). Even while seeing my gyno, he said that the pain was normal. It was really bad and I can say Ive made tremendous strides towards getting mentally well since stopping. Once I came off, my periods got a little heavier but the pain was there. \nGonna fast forward to 2021, as there werent really any other health problems arise other than debilitating cramping. August of 2021, I have a REALLY bad UTI. Like, would argue it was more of a kidney infection. I went to the ER because the pain was that unmanageable for the UTI. Sure enough, my urinalysis is indicative of one hell of a UTI. Shortly after the ER trip, I followed up with my gyno(a new one, previous one told me to come back when I wanted birth control again.) who ran a pap and did some other testing. The results came back ASC-US, which to my knowledge is that theres just a few cells that look a little weird/not supposed to be there. I figured it was a severe enough UTI and my doctor told me that it wasnt anything to worry about. But when I brought up my period concerns, she also brushed me off and told me the exact same thing the last doctor did, to come back when I wanted birth control. \nAt this point, Im Livid. Im in pain, my pms is bad, the cramping is god awful, no one is taking me seriously and now my pap came back abnormal and no one seems to bat an eye because Im apparently too young to be concerned for my cervical wellbeing. Not even a year later, may of 2022, Im back in the ER, this time with extreme abdominal cramping, pain after sex, and trouble urinating (didnt feel like a UTI pee). They ran some labs, another pelvic exam, and a TVUS. Urinalysis comes back abnormal (protein was high, some RBCs, and squamous epithelial cells) and the TVUS came back with a complex hypoechoic mass associated with the right ovary. The ER told me to follow up with gyno. I saw her, had another pap done, and the results came back as LSIL. So Im basically shitting myself because I was told the ASC-US would just go away on its own but no, some more cells down there decided to go awol I guess. We scheduled a Colposcopy for July and I brought up my period pains again, and again, birth control was brought up and denied. She also tried to tell me the same come back when you decide you want birth control. But then those results came back. To make matters worse, I couldnt even make it to my next gyno appt before getting back into the ER with the horrible abdominal pain. \nThe urinalysis comes back from this trip as abnormal as well. With high protein, ketones, squamous epithelial cells, and small urobilirubin(this one was confirmed to be negative after certain testing). They did another US and found that my left ovary had 2 mildly complex follicles. They also noted the sizes of my ovaries and my I uterus, and I honestly dont know what the normal sizes for those are. The er sends me off the same way. \nMy July appt comes for my colposcopy and they found a spot on my cervix and decided to biopsy it. She even showed me the sample in the little specimen jar, which I barely remember because they dont numb you for a biopsy of your cervix and I thought I was going to kick my doctor and the nurse across the room. She sends me on my way afterwards and we wait for the results. Results come back as CIN 1. Doctor says come back in a year for another colpo. \n\nPhew. Now were here in the beginning of 2023 and Im at my workplace breaking down in tears with one of the worst periods Ive had since this past summer. Im trembling, whimpering, any movement hurts, nauseated, etc. without any pain management or answers. Doctor said that CIN 1 goes away on its own, but I was already told that about the ASC-US and that shit didnt regress, it progressed into the LSIL. So I dont trust my doctor or any sexual wellness doctor for that matter. I dont know what to do about the pain, Ive even brought up sterilization/hysterectomy because its getting to be too much. Ive had a slew of other symptoms to count along side, such as unintended weight loss, loss of appetite, and pain during sex. \n\nIn all seriousness, Am I going to be okay? Because nothing is adding up to be good news and my family history is bad as well. I have SSs of my lab results as well.'"

Right after raising my feet to the bar and kicking my legs out I felt a sharp pain in my abdomen.\n\n*Bar kip example*: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPFWdelsDY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPFWdelsDY)\n\nI couldn\'t stop slouching and crunching my abdomen. Stretching backwards and straightening my posture was very discomforting. The severe pain subsided in a day but in the following months I couldn\'t stretch my stomach and had to sleep on my back with pillows under my knees to keep a flexed/crunched posture. Sleeping on the side was discomforting, because the stomach would hang to the side, bringing up the pain.\n\nIn 3 months, I felt better. However, there were always some flare-ups on pain.\n\n**Pain Description**: The pain felt like it always was in ""horizontal lines"", on 1-3 locations at a time (the sensation varies from time to time). Through my personal touch/observation, these horizontal lines of pain were always along *tendinous inscriptions* of the ab structures. Sometimes I feel lower 1 or two lines in pain. Other times its one of the upper line(s).\n\n*Tendinous inscriptions image*: [https://test.usabcd.org/courses/lk-native-ld2-basic-ugra/lessons/lknative-rectus-sheath-block/topic/3-anatomy-the-rectus-abdominis-muscle/](https://test.usabcd.org/courses/lk-native-ld2-basic-ugra/lessons/lknative-rectus-sheath-block/topic/3-anatomy-the-rectus-abdominis-muscle/)\n\n**Causes of Pain**: Pain flare-ups happened when moving heavy objects, pulling something heavy from ground, stretching the abdominal area, or a day after the occasional exercise. Twisting my torso side to side could also make pain worse, stretching one side of the abdomen, especially if twisting in my full range. Slight turns were okay.\n\nFlare-ups also happened immediately after eating specific foods (sunflower seeds, nutty bars, and when a bit bloated from eating. I have had some pain relief often immediately after having bowel movement.\n\n**Medical history of the Injury and Other Notes**\n\n\\- Within a week of the injury, ruled out hernia at a clinic.\n\n\\- 3+ months of slow pain relief, with flare ups. Mostly sedentary life and very little physical activity.\n\n\\- Late December through early February 2023: Doctors visit, abdominal ultrasound, and physical exam. No specific conclusions on either physical injury or gastric issues. No diagnosis.\n\n\\- February to present day, June 2023:\n\nSlow increase in physical activity and exercise. Some running. With a good warm up, stretching the abdominal area isn\'t painful (though I don\'t stretch too much there for now.)\n\nRare ab exercises can feel discomforting, and some pain returns the day after.\n\nJumping high or landing can have pain sensation return (inconsistently).\n\n\\- Bloated stomach, or consumption of some foods (as mentioned above) can feel discomforting or even painful along 1 or more "" horizontal lines"". Bowel movement often relieves discomfort and even pain.\n\n**Self-medication**: On a few occasions, I tried to apply heat or cold, which didnt help with pain much. But the cold helped numb things down. Heat helped to warm the abdomen and make some movements easier for a short time.\n\nRare/inconsistent instances of ibuprofen use (around 400-600 mg). Can\'t remember how effective pain relief is.\n\nMassage/poking: Generally, I do it when I feel pain or discomfort along the horizontal lines. Massage, poking, deep massage does NOT reduce the pain for me. Sometimes even makes me feel the pain more. But mentally feels good to do and feel out where I feel it.\n\n**Present day condition (June 2023)**\n\nSome pain flare-ups with physical activities, infrequent feeling of discomfort in the mornings or after food (for both, often relieved through bowel movement).\n\n**Concern**: While things have gotten better in 9 months, I am not certain what I should and should not do, given there is no diagnosis. The occasional pain increases made me curious if someone had an experience with pain like this.\n\n**Thanks in advance for any feedback!!!**'"

In the meantime, I am getting good medical/psych care with good recent comprehensive blood and urine tests, so this question is less about urgency and more about curiosity.\n\nBackground: I\'ve had a couple of relatively minor surgeries and two incidents of pinched nerve pain. Tramadol was about as effective as taking Skittles without the fun taste. Tylenol with codeine, Vicodin and Percocet all worked well, though - and the same is true for my mom, ditto for Tylenol with codeine causing the least amount of nausea. Also, potentially related: I\'ve never experienced a ""high"" like what people describe from opiates/opioids; just a reduction in pain plus some nausea and sleepiness. I also am jealous of people who experience a ""runner\'s high"" or similar after exercise - that might help me be more motivated to exercise.\n\n(As I have anxiety, depression and ADHD, I\'m guessing a neurotransmitter issue is at work as well?)\n\nMore recently, I tried Vyvanse, as Adderall\'s been out of stock. Despite taking the equivalent dose (potentially even a higher dose) it was as if I\'d taken nothing at all, particularly with what I can best describe as my craptastic working memory.\n\nI\'m working with a psychiatrist to nail down the ideal next steps but am posting here to learn more about what mechanisms could be at work in my body, partially as somewhat of a geek, and also to help connect the dots in case it\'s helpful for current and future medical care.\nThanks for any insights!'"

She also will get so dizzy while sitting she has to lay down. She says for the most part if she\'s laying flat on the ground, she feels fine. But if she pushes it, she sort of blacks out and falls. I was able to see one of these such ""fits"" today. She was getting out of my car and she could only walk a few steps before she grabbed onto a pillar for support to try and pause and collect her bearings. But she was gripping it for dear life. I tried to remove her hand and put it over my shoulder so she could use me for support in hopes I could get her to the door. I forced her hand around me, but she pushed past with uncommon strength and grabbed the pillar again. The entire time I was trying to talk to her for her to tell me what was happening so I could later describe it to the doctor, but it was clear she was having some sort of cognitive failure and she was sort of trembling. I was trying to reach her when she let go of the pillar and fell. I was able to kind of guide her fall so she didn\'t hurt herself further, but I was also able to see her face/eyes and could tell that she was not presently aware anymore, as in she fainted, blacked out, something, but was not cognitively aware. Once on the floor she immediately started vomiting and maybe pooped or just farted. I let her lay there and vomit on her side until she was aware again. She told me she didn\'t remember me trying to get her arm around my shoulder at all, nor did she remember how she got on the ground. When she was done vomiting she basically came completely back to herself and said, ""I feel fine now"". But she still had me go get an office chair from her apartment to roll her in on. I plan to acquire an actual wheelchair soon.\n\nShe has a history of falling, and has had several concussions in her life. She also has always had extreme sensitivity to things like buildings with unground parking, cities with a large subway system like London, anything with a bit of a hollow foundation, she\'ll feel a little to a lot unstable. This constant dizzy/nauseated thing is very new. But anytime she has fallen badly in her life, she has almost always done the ""blackout"" thing where doesn\'t remember the actual fall. Like it\'s some sort of self preservation against pain. So I have no idea if it\'s tied to the condition or just a quirk of her mind. She also has been unable to eat much because of the nausea. She tried to eat just a McDonald\'s cheeseburger today and she said after one bite it taste like pure salt and she couldn\'t eat anymore. She said my homemade soup was not too salty, but she couldn\'t eat much because of the nausea. But she often talks about food being extreme in its saltiness. She\'s been existing largely on saltines (ironically, not too salty) and diet pepsi of late.\n\nWe had come from an appointment at the audiology center to see if the problem was caused by an inner ear issue. It was determined that it was not related to inner ear, though the audiologist suspected it was possible that it had been a vertigo issue that corrected itself but she might just be having some psychosomatic fears that are triggering the symptoms. We both think this unlikely though.\n\nAbout a month ago she was having the same kind of pooping vomiting fit while I was with her so I took her to the ER. She was diagnosed as having DKA (blood glucose at 500 and high ketones) and admitted. They did a full blood workup and found that she was having low kidney/liver function due to the DKA and she stayed for a few days as they righted her insulin levels. They checked for viral issues because they suspected something gastric as well but it was not able to be determined. She recently moved and is normally good with her medication, but the stress of the move had caused her to forget which is what led to the DKA. But once she was out of the hospital, and taking her meds properly, the problem didn\'t stop. She had blood taken again 2 weeks ago by her PCP who also told her to stop the BP meds for two weeks to see if they were possibly the culprit, despite her having been on them for years. She was slightly anemic so they are now having her take iron w/ vitamin c, but her blood sugar was fine in this panel, and nothing else seemed out of the ordinary. I can get the panel results if someone thinks they have an idea but would need to see them.\n\nIn addition to all this fun, for about a year or so she\'s been hearing knocks at her door during the night. She never opened the door because it was at night and it scared her. It took a long time for me to be able to convince her to put a camera out, but when we did, it never caught anything. She\'s at a new place now and she still hears the knocking about once a week. It\'s always at an unreasonable hour for any kind of solicitors or anything (she says lately it\'s around 6-7 am when she hears it). I always thought it was a psychological problem because when it first started she also was hearing the voices of people she knew as though they were in the house, but only as she was waking up from sleep. The knocking she\'ll hear while fully awake. She stopped taking the Prazosin for a few months to see if that was causing it, as it\'s a rare side effect, but nothing changed. I have no idea if this is related to the dizzy/vomiting situation or just a fun comorbidity.\n\nI tried to mention all pertinent information, but I can add more if needed/requested. Does anyone have any ideas where we should try going next? I am planning on having her get a brain scan, but other than that I\'m a bit at a loss. Where\'s Dr. House when you need him?'"

They actually couldn\'t get the full pint because my bigger veins wouldn\'t show & my blood stopped flowing? They only got about 100ml. \n\nSo not even the full pint and I\'m feeling lightheaded, dizzy, and specifically after I eat, I am getting all sorts of nausea & have to lay down. Is this something I should be worried about? They did say I had a lower BP 108/65 yesterday (which btw is also not normal for me - I\'m usually 120ish/70ish) \n\nMy doctors office isn\'t open today for me to call & I\'m stressed. I have to go back next week for another phlebotomy since we didn\'t get it all.\n\nI do have stomach issues (never nauseous) and came off of Xifaxan two weeks ago, if that effects anything. I have also been taking Zyrtec for allergies. \n\nI have been drinking juice & lots of water. My meals have consisted of a pureed vegetable soup, beef burgers, sausage & lime Siete chips.\n\nAnother question: I have to get full labs for another doctor, including A1C. How long after the phlebotomy should I wait to get the labs? Or would the phlebotomy effect the results?'"

Husband (40M) took cabergoline prescribed by his urologist but it help boosted his mental health. No one knows why. Labs are WNL.',"b'Husband (40M, 511, 160lb) had been dealing with what we thought was just symptoms of depression and CPTSD for 4 years but we saw multiple psychiatrist and tried SSRI, SNRI and antipsychotic with no improvement in his symptoms. He did get a lot of side effects from mental health drugs though. He went to a urologist for another issue related to one of his drugs side effects this February and was prescribed cabergoline. His mental got better due to this medication but he needed to be taking medication every 3 days or hes back to baseline. It was like he was almost his old self. Able to smile and happy doing things.\n\nThis lead us to finding out he got a 2mm cyst in his pituitary that had been ruled out by multiple doctors as a possible cause. Currently hes on clomid 50mg daily to replace cabergoline. He cannot miss a dose. He tried to reduce the dose to half and he can definitely feel the different in his moods/ mental health. His base line before cabergoline was suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety, aggression, inability to focus and extreme intolerance to cold ( House was set at 78-80F and he would continue to feel cold and shivers).  All the symptoms improved on these 2 medications. We thought it would be hormone related but 2 endocrinologists dont think its hormone. They dont have suggestions on whats next.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13y9s24/etiology_of_my_flares/,b'Etiology of My Flares',"b'37M 5""6\' 185lbs white, quit smoking 7 years ago, drinks 2 times a week, no drugs\n\nI just got back from the doctor and I didn\'t feel like was able to ask him all my questions, could you help me out?\n\nI was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis two years ago. The first flare was in May two years ago, my second flare was in May last year, and I am currently on medication for my third flare that started last month, also May. Symptoms seem to start within two weeks of each other on a yearly frequency in May.\n\nI had some mild lingering problems before I was diagnosed, and (before diagnoses of the flare) they found erythamia, polyps and mild inflmation. After my first flare they found pancolitus and ulcers. Prednisone resolved my first two flares effectively and seems to be abating this one as well.\n\nNow my main questions are about the etiology of the flares themselves. Before I was diagnosed I was on the toliet and I was constipated (I believe that was caused by the oatmeal I had been eating everyday because I thought it was good for me.)  I was straining and I popped an internal hemorrhoid and there was blood in my stool. The blood eventually went away and I went to a doctor to talk about it.\n\nNow since the time I popped the hemorroid it always felt like in my guts there was something not right like I could feel the thing popped inside. When I move around in certain ways it almost feels like it ""rubs"" inside.  \n\nMy first flare happened the day after I had a heavy backpack on with a waistband that put a lot of pressure on that ""rubbing"" feeling inside. My second flare and this flare happen after about two months of working out regularly. I remember before my second flare I was running on the treadmill and being like ""I have to stop because my guts don\'t feel right"". The same thing happens when I do anything where I have to bend at the waist, like squats or deadlifts. It feels like it rubs those popped out intestines and causes distress.\n\nAll my flares happen in May because when the temperatures warm up I get motivated to work out regularly.\n\nNow clearly I have inflammation and the UC is latent inside of me. But it seems to be the more direct reason for the flares are when those popped out intestines rub inside me. My theory is that this causes  my already mildly inflamed guts to actually become a full fledged flare. \n\nDoes this make sense, or am I off base?'"

I do many things for work, taking whatever pays me, but I have spent the majority of my career as a data architect in medical research. I believe in what can be proven, but I also acknowledge we can\'t prove absolutely everything to be true or false and that the sciences are ever changing and ever growing. I would also note that my life have been a very challenging one and I seem to have the single worst luck of anyone I\'ve ever personally met. I\'ve been very stressed and it has gotten significantly worse of late, though I\'ve been told that I\'m handling it quite well. Of course, I also acknowledge that there\'s plenty of people who\'ve lived much worse lives. I\'m not trying to play the victim or be arrogant.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n**IMPORTANT LEAD IN**:\n\nI went to bed last night around 23:00. I woke up an hour or so later to the sounds of small booms outside the front of my house. I initially thought I\'d imagined it, but I rolled over and say all 3 of my cats with their faces pressed against the window screen, ears perked up. The sounds actually happened. A few moments later, I heard out smartlock on the front door unlock followed by the door opening and closing. Aside from internal doors, the front door is the only ""normal"" door to the house. the others are sliding doors that were all locked and barred and sound completely different when opened and closed. My roommate was asleep in his room and had been for hours. Nobody else lives here. Once again, I thought I imagined it, but the cats had all left my room and run downstairs to the door, which is what they do when someone comes over or gets home from work, errands, or whatever. I then head a set of male and female voices coming from downstairs. I grabbed a replica Master Sword (from The Legend of Zelda game series my roommate gave me a few years back) and went to my roommate. I tried to wake him up repeatedly, but he just mumbled something inaudible and rolled away over and over. So I went downstairs quietly. I spent 15-20 minutes walking around the house, following the voices, but never found anything. One of my cats, Needles, kept running off towards the voices then coming back to yell at me to follow him to them, which is what he does whenever someone comes home and I don\'t instantly go see them, but I never could find them. He\'s an utter attention whore. After that, I gave up and went back upstairs. Within 5 minutes I heard the door open and close again and the voices stopped. I don\'t have the greatest hearing in the world and never got close enough to make out what they were saying. I checked my Nest doorbell camera and at no point did anyone walk past the door. It is always recording and saved online for 5 days and, with the way it\'s positioned, it couldn\'t possibly fail to see someone come in or leave. I checked my smart lock app to see how it was unlocked and it said it was unlocked using a key by a user named ""error"". To clarify, the account\'s username that opened it was not literally ""error"", but rather that the app produced an error trying to identify the user. There are no physical keys to our house. It\'s entirely electronic and only myself and my roommate have the access codes.  \n\n\nI have no explanation for what happened. I was wide awake for it all. The cats saw it. My smartlock confirms it. It definitely happened.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n**THE REAL ISSUE**:\n\nAfter that all happened I went back to sleep. It generally takes me hours to fall asleep, however that\'s not what happened last night. I always fall asleep with the TV on for noise, but turned down. South Park is what I had on last night and throughout the course of the night, I could clearly identify the voices and episodes as they came and went, even during the ""dreams"" I\'m about to talk about, but NOT during the dream at the end of my story. That\'s a VERY important thing to note. After maybe 30 minute I felt like I was asleep, but I wasn\'t. I could feel my sheets, feel my head and arms on the pillow, move around, and feel my cat against my leg. That said, I started ""dreaming"" as if I was asleep. I\'d note now that I\'ve only ever had 1 lucid dream before and it was right after my long-term secret fiance had left me. It was stressful cause I simply came home to an empty house one day. I hadn\'t heard a word from him all day and all that was left was a quit-claim, signed and notarized, leaving the house entirely to me and taking his name off it and a hand-written note saying ""I\'ll always love you. I\'m sorry"". Never heard from him again. He was my world even though he wouldn\'t allow anyone to know we were together cause he desperately wanted to be ""straight"". I cried myself to sleep for quite literally years, though over time it became a silent cry. I\'ve been told the stress caused the lucid dream. I have countless wonderful stories about him, but he did give me me a strong case of PTSD, which I already had to deal with from an extremely abusive father.  \n\n\nBack to the story now. During this ""dream"" I found myself on a cement platform in a park with a table and two chairs in front of me, underneath a pavilion. There were lots of oak trees, azaleas, and camellias, like a park would look like where I grew up in New Orleans. A cup of my favourite tea was waiting for me. An middle-to-late aged woman was sitting at the table in a white pants-suit. She had blue eyes and gray hair. She introduced herself as ""death"" and asked me to sit and chat with her for a while. She discussed my life with me and asked me many questions. She knew things about me that I didn\'t even realize myself. My memory of it is hazy, however. The ""dream"" lasted 30-45 minutes. During the ""dream"" I was able to freely move my ""sleeping"" physical body. Movement would cause a strange type of interference with the dream that I cannot really describe, but as soon as I stopped moving it went back to being incredibly vivid. At one point I sat up entirely, walked to my desk, and scooped up one of my other cats, and brought him back to bed and wrapped my arms around him. I felt entirely real. I had fully control over my body and words through the entire ""dream"". At some point in the dream she asked me to stop moving around cause it made her ""presence"" more difficult and she insisted I trust her that it was real. Over the next 7 hours I had 7 more nearly identical ""dreams"". Each dream was roughly the same, but the scenery and other person changed. Each ""person"" I talked to  presented themselves as some kind of aspect of life. The ones I remember were: Death, Joy, Lust, Love, Pain, and Plague. I\'m struggling to recalled specifics about the conversations, but they all insisted it was real and that I was safe. Each discussion was different and revolved around the aspect of life they claimed to be.\n\nI woke up completely after that and was confused, scared, and for some reason, relieved. It felt like everything was going to be ok. I\'ve only experienced that feeling one other time. In December 2016, I was run over, intentionally, by a woman in an SUV while I was crossing the road on my motorcycle. She ran her light with the goal of killing me cause she was enraged by the pride flag sticker on the back of my motorcycle. It\'s a long story that I\'ve shared many times, but this is already long so I\'ll skip most of it. The force of the impact sent me flying 30 feet and I slammed into an oak tree and the majority of my body was either broken of entirely shattered and I damn well knew it. In relatively short order, I grew cold from my chest and it spread throughout my body and I knew what was happening. I was about to die. I suddenly felt this massive calming wave overtake me and felt like nothing could ever be wrong and everything is ok. I blacked out shortly later and when I woke up again, I was looking at EMTs and a nurse who\'d been attempting to revive me. I had been dead for around 5 minutes and had been kept alive by the person who was driving behind me and just so happened to be an ER nurse heading to work at the hospital less than a mile away.\n\nBack to the story again, I was awake for around an hour after all those experiences and ended up falling back asleep. This time, however, I had a regular dream, technically a nightmare, which is normal for me. I suffer from night terrors that are truly horrible and take 6mg of prazosin at night to prevent them. I still get them from time to time, but the overwhelming majority of my dreams are standard issue nightmares. I rarely have any positive dreams.\n\nAs a reminder, I\'d mentioned earlier that I had South Park on throughout the night. During the bizarre ""dreams"", I could hear the voices and episode as they came and went and even laughed at a particularly funny scene and told the ""aspect"" I was currently talking to about it when it happened. In my last dream of the night, the standard-issue nightmare, I could NOT hear the TV, could NOT control my body, and was completely asleep. I\'m not sure what that means overall, but I feel like it\'s a VERY important detail.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n**THE QUESTION**:\n\nQuite simply, what in the absolute hell happened to me last night?! I don\'t know what to make of any of it. As I said, I\'m not spiritual or religious in any way, but this is causing extreme level of conflict and concern within me. Furthermore, I\'ve been around a lot of dying people, I live with a doctor and dated him for the last 6 years (we broke up a few months back, but still live together), I\'ve dated other doctors, I spend a ton of time at doc appointments and in hospitals, and I myself work as a data architect in medical research most of the time. I\'m *very* aware that when people are nearing the end of their lives, most (60%, if I remember right) will hallucinate loved ones, angels, or even demons, and have long conversations with them over and over. In my experience, and to best of my knowledge, this usually happens within a few days preceding their death, but can happen as far as a few months in advance. Is that what I just experienced? I certainly have serious conditions, but I\'m otherwise perfectly healthy. Other than my migraines, cluster headaches, and chronic pain I feel perfectly fine. I\'ve had the migraines and clusters since I was a kid and the chronic pain since I was run over and nearly murdered. Nothing new has come up. I have been much more depressed and anxious about life lately as I\'ve had awful dating experiences, am struggling horribly to land a new job, and the end of my lease is coming up soon and I will have nowhere to live, but I feel like I\'m handling it well.\n\nI\'m exceptionally worried about what happened last night. I want to see a doctor about it, but I have absolutely no clue who I\'d go to. I know there\'s ""doctors"" who study dream analysis, but I talked to my ex about it, the doctor I live with, and we both feel like that\'s psuedo-science and doesn\'t carry any real validity. Because I\'m currently laid off, aren\'t receiving unemployment, and am only earning money by doing freelance and contract work, I have to use medicaid for insurance. There\'s no available therapists or psychiatrists I can go to cause I can\'t afford their cash rates and the ones who accept medicaid are seriously booked up and have multi-year long wait lists. I\'m on all of the wait lists, but I\'m definitely not gonna hear back anytime soon. I can\'t afford cancer treatments either and medicaid won\'t pay for them.\n\nMy mother insists all of it was a dream and I didn\'t wake up at any point through all of this. That\'s 100% false. I damn well know when I was awake and what I experienced. I have proof from the cats seeing and hearing what I did and the history on my door lock. I talked to a friend studying psych and he suggested I could be schizophrenic, but he\'s not a doctor or even a therapist and I was diagnosed as schizo year ago and treated for it, which worked, but when I moved to WA and found a much better psychiatrist, she vehemently disagreed, changed me to my current diagnosis and changed my medications which work far better, so I\'m inclined to believe she was right. My psychiatrist in Louisiana was not on good terms with the board and was wildly aggressive with diagnosis and treatment for all her patients. Her results were remarkable, but her methods were HIGHLY questionable and she was quick to prescribe controlled meds. She had me on lorazepam and adderall while I was also on 50mg of Percoset daily from my neurologist. I absolutely never had any problems, complications, or side effects because of this and it was actually extremely helpful in helping me hold down a job and be a functional adult, but it\'s generally not appropriate to do. I desperately need my ADHD treated to hold down a job, but the state of WA will not allow you to be on more than 1 controlled medication at a time. I understand, but it makes life extremely difficult for me and I think it\'s completely unfair to make me choose between living in intense pain or being able to focus for more than 5 minutes at a time.

During the series of ""dreams"" I met personified aspects of life itself, like love, death, regret, plague, etc that held conversations with me about my life. A while after the series of ""dreams"" ended, I ended up going back to sleep and having a normal nightmare where I couldn\'t control my sleeping, physical body and things were normal. Now I\'m wondering if that\'s my version of dying people hallucinating loved ones and I don\'t know what to do or what kind of doctor to see about it.\n\nThat said, please, **PLEASE** read the full post. There\'s way more to this and the TLDR makes me sound like a lunatic. I spend a lot of time carefully writing it up and explaining everything, ***like the insanely critical context the TLDR is missing***, please read it.'"

Live in Sweden.\n\n  \nI have had ""ear fullness/clogged ears"" everyday for the last 3 years. Both ears, but usually not at the same time, left is almost always worse. I also have tinnitus that has worsened the last 2 years and often feel dizzy (I\'ve had BPPV 1-2 times a year since I was 14, but this is not the same). I try to pop my ears all the time and when I do I hear a clicking/popping? sound and the ear fullness comes back after a few seconds. I can also feel pain when it is at its worse. I can usually feel when the weather is going to be bad, feels like the pressure in the air effects my ears.\n\n  \nI use hearing protectors? to feel some kind of relief (feels like the pressure changes when I put them on). Nothing really helps, sometimes it feels a bit better when I lie down.\n\n  \nI\'ve always had problem with my ears when I was sick or flying, but 2018 I started getting it even at other times. It came a few times a year and lasted a few weeks. Then in 2020 I got it and it never went away.\n\n  \nIt varies in intensity. I usually say I have 3 levels. Level 1: It\'s there, I have learned to live with it, it\'s tolerable. Level 2: starting to become annoying and effect my everyday life. Level 3: I feel like I\'m going insane, I have very difficult focusing. I feel a lot of pressure and pain, I have muffled hearing and usually hear my own voice louder+hear myself breathing? I don\'t really know how to explain it. It feels like I\'m in a bubble.\n\n  \nI have been to the GP around 10 times. Been to 3 different otolaryngologists. Been to the dentist to check my jaw and tested a night guard. Been to physiotherapist+chiropractor and tested jaw exercises. Have tested cortisone nose spray. But nothing has helped. Its just been getting worse and worse.\n\n  \nTests that have been done:  \n\\-  Rinnes test: normal.  \n\\- Hearing test: above average (but my boyfriend says my hearing is awful, I personally think I can hear the sound/voice but have trouble distinguishing what it is/says).  \n\\- Otoscopy, normal (but 3 different GP doctors said that my eardrum barely moves?).  \n\\-  Tympanometry: A-curve bilateral.  \n\\- CT-scans to check SCDS: normal, here are some of the images, I have more if needed ([https://imgur.com/a/0xpoJOJ](https://imgur.com/a/0xpoJOJ))\n\n  \n 1st ENT doctor said they think it\'s tensor tympani syndrome and said I should go to the dentist+physiotherapist+chiropractor. I even took 6 months off work and tried to lower my stress level, but it didn\'t help.\n\n  \n2nd ENT doctor said the same thing, that they think it\'s TTS (but they have not diagnosed me). They said there is nothing more they can do so I should go to a therapist and just accept the situation. I asked them if it could be Meniere\'s disease but they said no, because I have problem in both ears. But I read that around 20% of people with Meniers can get it bilateral?\n\n  \n3rd ENT doctor did the same tests+checked the opening of the Eustachian tubes.

Should I follow my Docs advice when he doesn't Seem to know what's wrong but nurse did?""","b'I went to my ENT this morning and when the nurse came in and asked me what\'s wrong I told him my situation:\n\nChronic cough, sore throat and nasal congestion for over 3 years. CT, X Ray of neck chest and lung all seem normal. Lung doctor gave me Trelegy 2 weeks ago and seems to helped with lung breathing better but coughing and nasal congestion is still there.\n\n**The weird thing about my coughing is that my coughing usually only happens when I look down or when my head is turned either right or left. This would cause my throat to feel itchy/sore and constricted and would cause phlegm in my throat and i would either have to cough or clear my throat.**\n\nAbout a week ago, I noticed **my neck is crooked. Instead of it being straight like "" l "" it is crooked like    "" / "" when I look straight on in the mirror**\n\nI changed my posture and straightened my neck and immediately my congestion seems to get better. after doing this for a day when I woke up and straighten my neck again, My congestion almost completely went away.\n\nNow I am remembering something my eye doctor told me about 5 years ago. That my vision is weird. One eye sees great far but terrible close, and the other eye is the opposite. Sees terribly far but good up close.  He said because of this, I don\'t need glasses yet because one eye compensates for the other but I might have neck problems later on. My off setting vision might cause me subconsciously to tilt and crane my neck in weird positions to try and see clearer. He was right, I did not notice how crooked my neck has gotten over time.\n\nI told all this to my nurse and she nodded like she understood and said off handedly something like **"" Ahhh.. I know. Your Neck has shifted and its probably causing your tonsils to rub against something in your throat that it shouldn\'t be rubbing against. Okay, hold on, the doctor will see you soon""**\n\nThis made me so happy because it feels like that\'s probably what is wrong with me. Everything made sense to me.\n\nWhen my doctor came in, I told him the same story and the doctor said he has no idea why looking down or in different directions would cause me to cough.  He said it might be a neurological issue and prescribed me Gabapentin. He said to give it a try and see if it helps and also referred me to a voice specialist to help with learning how not to cough.\n\n**It seems like the nurse knew what was going on when the doctor didn\'t.** I\'m not sure what I should do at this point. He is already the second ENT I\'ve seen and getting an appointment to see an ENT in my city takes Weeks if not month of waiting. I\'m not sure I want to start taking neurologic drugs because I\'m scared of possible side effects. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks'"
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13xzud2/i_sometimes_get_chest_pain_when_i_smoke/,b'I sometimes get chest pain when I smoke cigarettes. When is it considered a medical emergency?',"b'Details: 37 Female 130 lbs 56\n\nI quit smoking 7 years ago but sometimes smoke occasionally when I drink. Before, it used to be one cigarette a month or so. But in this past month, that smoking has started to become more and more frequent, but I still average one cigarette per day or less (so far). \n\nI noticed that sometimes in the middle of a cigarette, I will get intense chest pain. It feels sharp, like somebody is squeezing my heart, and I feel very out of breath when this happens. I swear, I can almost feel my heart skipping a beat when this happens at times. The pain is so intense on rare occasions that I sometimes have to sit down. \n\nI havent gone to the ER because it lasts maybe 10 seconds and then goes away. And I dont have any numbness or tingling in my left arm or jaw or anything like that.\n\nThe reason I havent been seen medically at all for this is because last year, I did go to the urgent care for intense chest pain that lasted several weeks. At that time, I was not smoking. Only drinking. \n\nI had an EKG done, and the EKG showed abnormal results, but the physician said at the time its not an emergency. They prescribed me nitroglycerin for the chest pain and just said that I need to get a referral for the cardiologist.\n\nIt was a slow and long wait to see the specialist. By the time I made an appointment with the GP, then the cardiologist, and then waited for my followup appointment for the echocardiogram, over 8 weeks had passed. By the time I was able to get seen by the cardiologist, my chest pain was totally gone, and my echo stress test showed normal. \n\nThe cardiologist at the time speculated that I possibly did have a blockage at one point, but that my body passed it while waiting for the echocardiogram. He said that 40% of patients who have a blockage will pass it naturally before they get seen for the echocardiogram. \n\nI dont want to go through all of that BS and waiting and appointments and everything again only for the same thing to happen. So I just want to know when chest pain is considered to be an emergency. When should I worry about it, and when do I need to seek immediate medical attention for it?\n\n\n\n\nPatient history: I do exercise (between 1 to 5 days a week depending on my schedule and mood), but I should really do more cardio. I mainly lift weights. I also drink quite a bit. Used to be every day, but for now, I have managed to cut it down to once every 2 or 3 days. \n\nI am trying to gradually reduce it to 1 to 2 times a week and then stop completely. This is to minimize the mild withdrawal symptoms. I tried stopping cold turkey before, and I had insomnia and cold sweats and tachycardia lasting for two weeks. Its not bad enough to require medical detox IMO, but it is uncomfortable. \n\nI wouldnt say I have alcoholism, but I do drink on the fairly heavy side. I drink between 1 and 4 drinks when I do drink for dinner. Again, until a couple weeks ago, it used to be every night. I have been trying to drink less so I can stop smoking completely again. I crave cigarettes the most when Im drinking.\n\nI have been taking hypnotherapy sessions to help me stop drinking and smoking entirely. That is how I quit smoking the first time, was after a few sessions of hypnotherapy. I also sometimes smoke herbal cigarettes (no tobacco, no nicotine cigarettes, theyre made out of tea leaves) to help give me a placebo effect buzz sometimes.\n\nI did used to abuse stimulants that are considered to be cardiotoxic on and off for 15 years until my late 20s.  I do not take any drugs anymore except alcohol, tobacco, and very rarely, marijuana. Its been that way for over 7 years.'"

I've gone to my PCP twice with the below symptoms and she has not had any suggestions. I'm hoping someone could help identify what's going on with me, or point me in the right direction. \n\nHere are my primary symptoms: \n\n1. I'm losing color in my lips. The red pigment in my lips is gradually disappearing. \n\n2. My stomach is regularly bloated. I assume it's my bowels that are bloated, but there aren't IBS symptoms. I'm bloated as soon as I wake up, so I don't think it's *too* dependent on what I'm eating. \n\n3. I'm regularly dehydrated, despite drinking 2-3 liters of water each day. My eyes produce tiny white flecks of sebum. Blood vessels in my eyes are easily strained, and I occasionally feel vessels burst in my eyes. \n\n4. Wounds in my skin don't heal properly or quickly. The wound will close relatively quickly, but it will remain red in color before turning into a pink/red scar (as opposed to healthy tissue). TMI: If I pick at acne on my arm, the injury site (although scabbed or scarred) will still be visibly pink and raised weeks later.  \n\n5. My fingernails have vertical ridges. These seem to worsen with stress, unlike natural age-related ridges. \n\nI don't drink or smoke, or do any awesome recreational drugs. \n\nAs for medications, I take 75mg of Effexor and 15mg of Vyvanse every day (although this has been as high as 40mg at times). I have been taking the vyvanse for 12 years. None of these symptoms were  present for the first five years of taking the vyvanse, but have since appeared over the last seven years. \n\nI've explored anemia and this isn't that. My blood work panel is pretty good, aside from having zero Eosinophils. Perhaps my symptoms stem from poor circulation, a nutritional deficiency, medication side effects, or impaired immune function. \n\nI am very grateful for any insight you can share -- or even just to hear that someone else has experienced some of these symptoms. Thank you. :)"""

Is it something that can be seasonal?\n\n 2. Can this can cause, or is it related to excessive sweating?  I sweat at night HEAVILY when sleeping, and I feel that sometimes it happens more and sometimes less, and I also notice during the day that I sweat more.

I have tried to exercise but can only manage quarter to half mile walks here and there. I\'m completely incapacitated compared to how I was prior to these issues. (Despite being closer to 400lbs, I could still walk a couple miles, even with a bad back.)\n\nI have been having chest issues for a few months. They started suddenly out of the blue at the beginning of March. I have been to the ER 4 times now, and have started to get dismissed by staff as ""just having anxiety."" I would like to note I do not have anxiety, and I stay calm in emergencies. If the house is on fire, I walk out. I have seen several doctors, and have had many tests done, all have come back nominal. Close attention so far has been paid to my heart due to my described symptoms. ECG, stress test with dye, ultrasound of heart and throat (looking for blockages in neck due to constant headaches and neck pain) I am currently on the end of a one-month holter monitor stint, as well.\n\nSo far no known cause. I am not one to go to doctors. I have not been to a doctor in over a decade. I only go if I feel I am dying, or require some form of serious medical attention, like impalement, or a heart attack. I have almost no medical record as a result. I went as a child, then not again until I was 30.\n\nI am coming here as I have to wait 2+ months to see doctors again after the last tests, and the problem has only gotten worse. I\'m looking for potential answers in the meantime as doctors have begun to look at me like I\'m crazy or just making it up and having anxiety attacks/panic attacks. I do not have anxiety issues. They told me it doesn\'t matter; your body can have a panic attack even if you\'re calm. I found that hard to buy, but it is what it is.\n\nSymptoms are simple but complex. Leads me to believe I have multiple issues together. The main issue I\'ve been having has all the hallmarks of a traditional male heart attack that come and go, but d-dimer levels and enzyme tests come back nominal. ECG is nominal during these ER visits. I have recovered without serious medical intervention each time an \'episode\' (I call them episodes, as I currently do not know what\'s wrong with me) occurs. I lay in the hospital bed for a couple hours while they run tests, and eventually my body returns to normal on its own. Only the first time they took me seriously and gave me meds. I was given nitro. After heart tests came back normal, they gave me an IV of some stomach meds, and prescribed me omeprazole as the stomach is the second leading cause of heart attack symptoms, according to the doctor on staff at the time. If I had gastritis or something, it would allow me to heal while I waited to see a doctor proper. I have been taking it for about two months now. Symptoms have not improved. I have stopped going to the ER due to how the staff started treating me. I guess I can understand. A patient walks in saying they have heart attack-like symptoms, and all heart tests come back normal, thus, it must all just be psychosomatic, they figure. Before March, I did not have these issues. It came on suddenly one day and never stopped.\n\nChest pain, neck pain, arm pain, back pain. Shortness of breath, lightheadedness, weakness in limbs/body, confusion, crushing sensation in chest. At all times I am in pain, with flare ups that feel like heart attacks. Particularly left side of neck, and left side of sternum right about where your heart is. They hurt all the time. I have felt like I\'ve had a chest flu for months, without being sick at all. Tightness in chest, weakness, sickly aching, metallic tinge/taste like when you have the flu/bronchitis/pneumonia. Head hurting, rushing, swollen heavy hot feeling. I tested negative for Covid on nose swab tests in the ER during late March.\n\nOnly things to note were I had a fever of 100 on March 15th and March 17th. White blood cell count was low according to ER doctor, but my primary doctor informed me it was within normal parameters. I don\'t know what normal means when it comes to WBC, and they never showed me my test results. Google was not  helpful, as always. It just says cancer for 5 pages, then on page 6 it says ""might be the result of the flu."" But if I had to guess, it\'s like how resting heart rate works. Is a resting bpm of 98 high? Yes, but it\'s within ""normal"" levels, just unhealthy/out of shape. It\'s not tachycardia yet nor life threatening in the moment. I am guessing my white blood cell counts were at the lower end of acceptable. ER doctor suggested possible viral infection or nerve impingement to explain my symptoms. I told the doctor, ""If my chest could throw up, it would."" Nausea during the 17th\'s episode was in my chest and neck, not restricted to my stomach.\n\nOn the last visit, the ER tried to give me two meds. I tried one, but was advised by my doctor not to use the other. Both are apparently anti-inflammatory meds, but my inflammation markers were not elevated according to my doctor. The first med was prescribed off-label. Hydroxyzine. The bottle says ""take three times a day as itching persists"" but it was apparently given to me as an anti-anxiety med. It has not helped in any way, only made things worse, in fact. I was advised to ""take it the moment symptoms arise."" It had not dulled symptoms in any way, even when I took it 30 minutes prior to having an episode by pure luck, as I cannot predict when an episode will happen. They are sudden and violent. I will be okay one second and then five seconds later I\'m doubled over. Hydroxyzine\'s side effects are all the reasons I went into the ER in the first place, and I have stopped taking it as a result. Heart rhythm issues, chest, arm, neck pain, etc.\n\nThe second med was called methylprednisolone. My doctor advised me against taking it, as I could not risk getting sick during any of my procedures. It apparently knocks your immune system down really hard. I did not argue, as I have been on steroids before, due to asthma as a child. They are not fun, and often make you feel more sick than you were before you started them. They usually never helped and just made the issues worse in the end. Stuck to normal inhalers and medicines to treat asthma as a child.\n\nSecondary to the classic heart attack symptoms, I have been experiencing gastrointestinal issues and what appear to be heart issues as a result, but nothing easily seen like myocarditis. Stomach pain, abdomen pain, nausea, difficulty swallowing, loss of appetite. I have lost about 60lbs in two months. I have episodes of tachycardia and high blood pressure. (160bpm while at rest with greater than 180/120 bp) The Tachycardia/bp issues will come on at random quite often, though there\'s been a link with having to use the bathroom and an episode occurring. I am unsure if I have to use the restroom immediately after tachycardia because I had tachycardia, or if I had tachycardia because I had to use the restroom. Such as, having some kind of problem that cuts off blood flow when a bowel movement is happening right before the anus, thus causing my heart to race to try and get more blood somewhere. I am no doctor, though. All I know is, when I have an episode of Tachycardia that is short lived, within 5-10 seconds I will have to go number 2.\n\nMy current and only guess, is that it is a combination of issues flaring up all at the same time.\n\nPossible theories are long covid, or other form of infection/disease you can contract (though feels unlikely considering all the symptoms I have together, but I haven\'t ruled out, say, having gotten a lung infection or chest infection from some strange mold or something) costochondritis, nerve impingement, GERD/IBS (or issues that are a result of it, such as thinning of the esophagus, esophageal spasms/gastritis)I wondered if I had long covid, as that is known (at least according to the nurses I spoke to) to not show up on nose swab tests, and I had similar symptoms to others. (feeling like you\'re having or about to have a heart attack all the time for a month straight, along with feeling ill without actually being ill) One radiologist said they had long covid, it showed up on no instant tests, only on special test doctors had access to. (wasn\'t PCR off the top of my head) In that test, they were still covid positive 6 weeks after nose swab tests said they were negative.\n\nHowever, I have too many other symptoms that don\'t line up, such as nerve impingement-like symptoms like never ending rhomboid pain. Constant and unrelenting neck pain, with numb parts of body, such as back of tongue and fingertips.\n\nHeart issues run in the family, most of my family had heart attacks young, (20-40) however back issues and gerd also run in the family. My mother and father have the same back issues, (scoliosis/lordosis) complete with nerve impingements in the same areas, causing chest/neck/arm/back pain exactly like what I described to them. Both need surgery, one did have many many surgeries trying to fix the issues, even radiofrequency ablation when all else failed. (Just to stop the crippling pain.) My father has so far denied surgery. He is letting a degenerative disc syndrome run its course and fuse his spine naturally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGerd/IBS complete with spasms run in the family, too. I have had great difficulty eating these past two months. It was not a fear/trauma response. I have lost my appetite. I get sick when I eat, my stomach and intestines hurt when food goes through me. I just don\'t like eating anymore, I eat because I have to, to survive. I ate 100 calories a day for nearly a month, until episodes of things like hypoglycemia forced me to eat. My diet is healthier now, though is still forced. I get between 1-2,000 calories per day. I am losing 1-3lbs per week instead of 10+. My diet consists mostly of easy to eat things, like a piece of whole grain toast and non-dairy yogurt in the morning. Lots of water, but I only ever drank water, anyways. Despite being 350+ lbs, I did not like sugary drinks. I drank almost exclusively water and sometimes tea. Coffee was rare, once a month, maybe. I have had intestinal issues in the past. I\'ve always assumed I had IBS, as it was easy to upset my intestines. That is partly why I did not like soda. One sugary drink and my body evacuated almost immediately, and with a lot of pain. One time like 5-6 years ago, I almost called 911 when using the bathroom, as I had such an incredible burning pain in my side trying to go. I chalked it up to too much cheese in a chili I had prepared, and stayed away from cheese for a while. I never had that level of pain again trying to use the bathroom. Where I felt the pain, is marked in green on my picture at the start of this thread, that is where I usually feel intestinal pain.\n\nMother also has costochondritis and angina issues. Costochondritis seems to run in the family. My uncle just went to the ER thinking he was having a heart attack, too. All tests nominal. He couldn\'t breath for weeks leading up to it, with occasional chest pains, until one night the big one hit him. Same reason I went to the ER on March 15th after toughing it out for two weeks with the symptoms. One day it got so bad I just simply had to go in. BP went like 200 over something, heart racing over 150bpm, incredible chest pain, choking sensation, etc.  My mother has learned to live with this, however it backfired when she mistook a massive heart attack for an average costochondritis episode. She is so used to severe pain that she walked herself a half mile and up a flight of stairs while having her heart attack. She coded several times and had to be life flighted to an advanced hospital in a different state. She barely survived, required extensive surgery. It\'s part of the reason I took my own pain seriously in the beginning. I too live with chronic pain, but it\'s because of my bad back. I never had chest pain. Just arm pain, messed up shoulder, and leg issues from a crooked back. Sciatica pain and all that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConditions to note for my parents: Mother has ehlers danlos syndrome, and ankylosing spondylitis. It\'s possible I inherited auto-immune issues from her. Father has afib, I do not know if it\'s familial afib. His afib does not appear to be a cause of another condition like COPD. He just has afib on its own. His father died at 55 suddenly when his heart stopped. It\'s possible he had afib and never knew it. He was like us, didn\'t go to doctors. Dad has complained of issues for 30 years before doctors actually diagnosed him with afib. This is why I\'m on a heart monitor, as I described having the same issues as him. Random bouts of tachycardia, high bp, and ""strange beats/skipped beats"" when feeling my heart beat. Palpitations. So far nothing detected out of the ordinary. Makes me wonder if they\'re actually esophageal spasms as mom has always had bad gerd/IBS, and so does her mom. It\'s crippling for both. Mom just had a colonoscopy and endoscopy. (normal check up type stuff since she is getting closer to 50) The team were unable to complete the procedures, as her insides locked up. They couldn\'t get the scope down her throat, it was too tight.\n\nMy parents both smoke/chewed and drank heavily all their lives. Makes me wonder why I\'m having the same exact issues at the same exact ages as them when I\'ve never done anything in my life. I\'ve never even been drunk before. My mother at around 30, started to complain like I am, and by 35 she was out of commission until she had that massive heart attack in her 40s. She lived 10 years in chronic pain being told there was nothing wrong with her until she finally got specialists from out of the area to look at her, that\'s when they found her auto-immune issues and issues that stemmed from hyper mobility. Doctors have told both that a lot of their problems would be solved if they just stopped doing \'x\' yet I have the same problems and never have done these things. Imagine developing diabetes type 2, but you only ever ate a healthy diet, while your dad ate nothing but white bread and Mountain Dew all his life. It\'s confusing why you ended up with it, too, at the same age as him. Now imagine hearing his doctor say, ""You\'d have your diabetes nearly completely under control if you just stopped drinking so much soda..."" Yours is just as bad as his, yet you\'re eating rice and water for dinner, next to his Mountain Dew and cake.\n\nEdit: Also to note, I have POTS-like symptoms, though rather than my blood pressure tanking, it rises when I stand up. Part of why it\'s difficult to exercise. Heart goes from 65 to 110bpm from just standing up, and it\'s hard to move around when your heart is pounding so hard, and your head is rushing with blood. (Though it\'s possible my blood pressure tanks but it FEELS like it goes up when standing.) Feels like you just got done running, but you\'re standing perfectly still. Heart will go to 160bpm from basic walking when like this. These symptoms come and go. Sometimes I can stand up just fine, walk around just fine, only hitting 135-140bpm during uphill exercise.\n\nEdit 2: Got a sudden and tight sickly pain in my lower sternum. Been getting that more recently, don\'t like that one bit. It knocks the wind right out of you for an instant. For like 1 second you feel like you\'re about to pass out, and then the pain passes after 1-5 seconds. They come on suddenly and without warning. It\'s like someone reaches in and grabs your insides for a second. It stops anything you\'re doing, even sleeping. Happens at least every other day, once to several times in a day. Last night it happened once, the most painful one yet. Today it\'s happened twice, but they were minor.  \n\n\nEdit 3: Legs seem to swell a lot throughout the day. It goes away after a night\'s rest. Both swell equally.'"

Occasionally drink lets say once every 2 weeks.\n\n**Conditions:**   \nEczema\n\n**Medications:**   \nClobetasol cream (Forgot percentage will edit later)\nBetamethazone Val Cream 0.1%\nTacrolimus/Protopic Ointment\n\n**Background:**  \nFor the past 6 months I was diagnosed with Eczema starting in November when I was 19. My family doctor originally prescribed me betamethazone cream which didnt do much for the area since the eczema was too thick and then gave me clobetasol to weaken it first. I have since stopped using the latter and stuck with former on my foot. However, sometime recently it has also flared lightly on my left eyelid and gential region. My doctor prescribed me Tacrolimus protopic ointment for this and being the tool I an I confused the two medications for a day. I had been basically eczema free until about 2 weeks ago likely due to the hotter weather and it had been 4 months since taking these medications. I applied light betamethazone to my eye and penile shaft and then about 10 hours later I realized how stupid that was. I know generally speaking you are supposed to taper off with Topical steroids but the areas that had eczema have been fully cleared. Im still using it on my foot which has re-flared but have kept these areas free of it after realizing my mistake. Did some research into the complications of Topical Steroid use on my eyes and genitals and now have been worry warting while I wait for my next appointment with my family doctor and optometrist. \n\nMy vision as far as I can tell is the same but I am noticing that at night, lights tend to starburst a lot more intensely than I remember, but I could be gaslighting myself. My left eyelid burns when touched and feels weird to blink with. My left eye hasnt turned red but has been occasionally feelings a pins and needles effect. My right eye as well but a lot less. Its been about 4 days but no major changes in vision other than everything feelings hazy and the star bursting. Ive tried the finger test where you feel if the top of your eye feels like a ripe tomato and both do. \n\nMy genitals just feel thinner/sensitive and my erections not as strong or frequent (probably a psychological effect of me worrying).  They also feel a little dry. As fair as I can tell, it doesnt seem like I can engage in sexual activity for the moment not due to any impotency but inability to get a firm enough erection due to either mental or things known to me.\n\n**Question:**  \nSo my question is, since I have likely damaged these areas by accident, what are some measures I can take at the moment to reduce onset conditions before my appointments 1-2 weeks later? Is there a way to thicken/revitalize these areas so they can be as close as they were before? Should TSW (Topical Steroid Withdrawal) be a concern?\n\nThanks for your time."""
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12veocd/zoloft/,b'Zoloft',"b'Hi everyone. My wife (28) has been taking 100mg Zoloft 1x daily for about 6 or 7 months now and has done great on it with minimal to no side effects. She takes no other medication. However, for the last month, every time she takes it, with or without food, she feels nauseated, sick to her stomach, tingly hands, feels spaced out, shes vomited a couple of times too. She has to lay down and drown everything out for about an hour before it passes. She says it doesnt feel like normal anxiety or panic, but we arent ruling that out. We have an at home pulse ox, bp monitor, and glucose meter (Im F26 and have pcos and have to monitor that, she doesnt have any other conditions other than anxiety/depression) and when Ive taken all vitals I can to just rule things out when she feels that way, its all completely perfect readings. She actually went to the ER when it first started and they did an abdominal CT and found no issues. So my question is, is it possible this is all from her Zoloft, even though shes taken it for months now? No accidental double dosing, no recent increase in frequency or dosage, nothing. No alcohol or drug use whatsoever. I know these medications can cause weird symptoms at any time and vary heavily from person to person. I took it one time when I first got prescribed it for myself from our PCP and several hours later I was in the hospital being treated for seratonin syndrome and can no longer handle any SSRI at all. So Im definitely feeling a little anxious about the way shes feeling. \n\nAlso, she has an appt with PCP at the end of next week. Just wanted to see if anyone has had a similar experience in the meantime! \n\nTL/DR: Zoloft 100mg presumably making wife sick 6+ months into treatment'"

She is on various psychiatric medications including the anti-psychotic aripiprazole along with the SNRI generic Effexor equivalent as well as Buspirone and Topiramate (this last item to help with her weight), and many of these have been in her regimen for the better part of 20 years. She had a colonoscopy 15 months ago which at the time found no remarkable problems. Presently, my wife also takes an OTC laxative along with 290 micrograms daily of Linzess (which is expensive and not available as a generic product) on alternating days. Sometimes, she can get a little out, but ideally, there should be more. Her dietary intake is nearly normal, and it has included a greater amount of water of late.\n\nIs it possible that there has been some solidification along the colon such that a normal laxative/softening agent is not likely to help? Would this potentially explain why it might sometimes be narrow? My wife does not complain about feeling bloated/full in her lower abdomen, and she also has not said much about a loss of appetite. Would an in-office enema treatment at the gastroenterology (GE) clinic be in order? The presentation has always included constipation as the main symptom. What else might be necessary that does not require an ongoing dose of a drug that is quite costly and which may have other unwanted side effects? Might the higher concentration of Linzess be effective, and how safe is it to take a laxative periodically? I have seen that a ""colon cleanse"" procedure might be risky; a friend of hers had posted something about such a routine as offered by a natural health center. Might it be necessary or suitable for her to consume the products designated as integral for bowel preparation before a colonoscopy even if she does not have one done even if just once to help restore regularity?\n\nWould it be unlikely that in just the past 1 1/4 years something serious would grow in the lower part of the canal if the \'scopy found nothing earlier? There is no bleeding seen by her. What other imaging/screening that can detect abnormalities in real time might the GE center do that would not be as extensive or pricy as a colonoscopy? (Medicare which she is on will only pay for such only every 10 years for risk screening; I am unsure about if she would be eligible yet for a diagnostic \'scopy which is covered at 80%). Might a lower abdominal X-ray (with or without barium) or CT scan show anything unusual?\n\nThanks. I will anticipate discussing this as well with the clinician at the GE facility as time and context permit as long as I am also there with my wife.'"

This in turn floods the entire area near their facility with ghastly emissions that can smell like anything from strange indescribable chemicals, melted plastic and metallic smells through to rotting organs, feces, death and more. \n\nThese emissions would fill my home and they were thick, heavy, steamy and inescapable and I breathed them in for over 5 years.\n\nIn that time I've experienced a whole raft of side effects such as full body uncontrollable itching, rashes, insomnia, trouble breathing, skin changes and more. Whenever I would experience serious side effects like a burning throat and lungs I'd approach the company and the manager at the plant would tell me that what I'm breathing in is completely safe to breathe in and that I have nothing to worry about, this happened on numerous occasions for years on end - this in turn meant that even I suspected the emissions weren't exactly safe to breathe in I didn't quite put 2 and 2 together and work out that the side effects I was experiencing was due to coming into contact with volatilized waste because hey - it's a medical waste facility and you just expect these sort of places to operate well above board. \n\nOne day it all clicked and after leaving the area for 2 weeks the symptoms subsided, then when I tested it again by leaving the area just to confirm it was something to do with the plant - the side effects subsided.

Had an edible around a month ago, took small doses at first and everything went fine. Few days later used a cart and got heavy heavy pain in my chest, felt like my heart was beating out my chest, but not in a fast way felt just very slow and heavy. Almost felt like I was dying and I never felt anything like that before. Never got high, just that feeling. Its a very strange feeling, felt like my heart was gonna explode or something. Went to doctor not too long after and they said nothing was wrong just from a quick overview. Still had small pains and maybe panic attacks?? For days after this and still do ocasionally. Doctor said it was mainly stress and just panic. I still do get sharp pains in my chest and what feels to be my heart area. After maybe a month of feeling fine I tried an edible again (since the first time everything went fine with no bad effects) and then that time I got the same effect as using the cart. My heart/chest area felt so tight and heavy, I got dizzy, felt like I was gonna pass out, friend said I looked very pale, hearing and vision were so strange and weird, and the strangest part to me was a very sharp pain in my balls, and no thats not to be funny it genuinely did feel like my balls were stinging. I have had high anxiety and stress before all of this but I still feel random discomfort or pain since in my chest area, kinda in the middle and the heart area. All products were legit and tested by my friends and they had no bad effects to it so I know its an issue with me, not the products. Have been perfectly healthy all my life, only chest issue I can note is that I have very mild pectus excavatum. have not done drugs for long and have quit everything since these incidents.

I'm at a point where I've seen a lot of doctors, and no one really has answers. To a point I feel like maybe I'm just crazy. Maybe nothing is wrong and I'm just paranoid. But I feel terrible, all the time. Pain, exhaustion, severe apathy and a wide array of different symptoms. (see list below) I feel like I'm just getting through the days, instead of living.\n\nI'm not sure if there is any point to me continuing to chase a diagnosis or if I should just accept this is how I'm going to feel. So that is my biggest question today. Are there steps I can take forward? Should I? Does anyone have a suggestion of what next? Thanks for any insight.\n\n38F, 5 ft, 185lbs, white, See below for list of medical complains, non smoker, no drugs, rarely alcohol.\n\nOmeprazole 40mg 1x day\n\nFlorajen daily probiotic\n\nWelbutrin 300mg 1x daily\n\nBuspirone 10mg 1x daily\n\nMirena IUD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pain**:\n\n(Symptom) Pain in hands, mostly. Some stiffness in legs. Pain in hands seems effected by weather. Doesn't feel like nerve pain. No tingling or traveling of pain. Some fingers hurt more than others depending on the day. Hurts most after waking up, but lessons with movement through the day.\n\n(Diagnosed) Inflammation markers in blood.\n\n(Ruled Out) Autoimmune - Lupus, Rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n**Digestive**:\n\n(S) Constant Heart Burn (since late teems)\n\n(S) Food getting stuck in lower esophagus. (scope and dilation completed)\n\n(D) Diaphragmatic Hernia, Dysphagia, Esophageal obstruction, Esophagitis w/o bleeding.\n\n(Ruled Out) Eosinophilic esopagitis\n\n(Observation, Tests or Treatment) Omeprazole\n\n(S) Chronic Constipation (since late teens)\n\n(O.T or T) Took Colace daily for years. BMs once every 5 or 6 days was normal. Was recently suggested Florajen daily probiotic by new GP. I had taken probiotics previously but this one actually seems to help. Without the colace, BMs once every 1 to 3 days. I have a diet already that should avoid these problems. Plenty of water, fruits and vegetables. I've even eaten prunes multiple times a week for years.\n\n(S) Possible new trouble swallowing at top of throat. It feels like a spot stuff just won't move past sometimes. No fear of choking on the food, it just stops going down sometimes. Doesn't happen often currently, just sometimes. Also occasionally choking on liquids. When drinking, sometimes just on saliva, and its happens sometimes while gargling mouth wash. This really isn't happening often enough I feel like diagnostic tests could be helpful. Couple 2 or 3 times a month maybe.\n\n**Movement**:\n\n(D) Essential tremor (I've had this tremor since my late teens)\n\n(S) Signifcant twitching in arms/hands, legs/feet, some less common twitching that seems to effect my neck/head. Very very very annoying daily eye twitching in right eye. Happens on and off most days.\n\n(O.T or T) Standard MRI w/wo contrast - no problems seen, which rules out MS, right?\n\nSaw a neurologist my GP sent me to. He did a standard exam - movement, walking, eyes, etc. Does not believe it to be Parkinsons currently. Believes tremor happens more while moving than at rest. Its hard for me to pay attention to my tremor and twitching. If I'm watching for it, it is a struggle to know if its happening because I'm expecting it, or if I'm slowing it down because I'm concentrating on it. There just doesn't seem to be a natural way for me to monitor it.  A partner of mine has observed me while I was unaware and watching a movie and says the twitching is constant. The neurologist says the tremor is more prevalent while in motion, though the time I notice it the most is while I'm falling asleep. Some nights there is a very strong vibration in my arms as I'm nodding off.\n\nI can't say I know if I'm experiencing sleep disturbances. I recently purchased an Oura ring that monitors my sleep.  It has a couple times reported movement during REM sleep, but I don't really know how accurate it is. It isn't frequent though. I did have an event this morning when I was dreaming, I was quickly leaning forward in my dream, and woke myself up jerking forward. But this is unusual. I don't experience drastic punching or kicking regularly.\n\n(S) Intermittent weakness in hands and balance.\n\nMy hands are fine 98% of the time, but then just every so often stop working suddenly and for a split second. I've been dropping a lot of stuff. I've broken some dishes, the lids of several of my water thermos cups I use (metal cups but plastic lids). Recently had to replace the screen protector on my phone due to several drops and cracks. I bought a cup recently for my water that has a wide handle that I can fit my hand inside of. The cup holds onto me as much as I have to hold onto the cup. I'm hoping that this will keep me from breaking the lid on it. I've dumped a pan of stuff all over the inside of my oven on a couple occasions. Recently threw dinner all over the kitchen floor. I've always been a pretty coordinated person previously.\n\nThe balance is a bit less common. Is always when I'm moving from being in a lower position to higher. Like laying down or sitting on the floor, to standing. I'm totally fine, then suddenly everything spins and I'm not moving the direction I intended to. And it lasts just a second and then I'm fine.\n\n**Skin**:\n\n(S) Red, painful & flaky skin on scalp & face. Sometimes damp feeling. Head and shoulders helps. Face flares up and gets better over time. Steroids seem to help during flare up.\n\n(D) The allergy doctor I saw told me it was Rosacea. I don't believe this is correct. The medication he gave me for it did nothing (acid and antibiotic creams). The head and shoulders and steroids are much more helpful.\n\n**Mental Health:**\n\n(D) Depression, Anxiety Disorder (On Welbutrin and Buspirone. Buspirone seems to aggravate tremor, though neurologist says it is fine to continue.)\n\n(S) Constant fatigue. - Oura Ring shows no sleep disturbances. I sleep through the night, hitting sleep stages in a way that is normal, and I seem to have no breathing disturbances.\n\nExercise truly isn't all that helpful. During covid lock-down I started running on an elliptical. For 1.5 years I ran 4+ miles, 5 or 6 days a week. The benefit in how I felt was minimal. Which makes it really hard to keep up with, even though I would like to. During that period I was eating great as well. I was at a healthy weight, though have since gone back to being overweight. I do start to feel better following a healthy lifestyle, but not by much and still feel like I don't tend to feel like I have the energy to get through most days.\n\n(S) low motivation, days where focus is very hard.\n\n**Menstrual**:\n\n(S) Severe heavy bleeding.\n\n(O.T or T) Ultrasounds. No observed cysts or problems. No pain. My glucose levels have never been high. I am not diabetic or pre-diabetic. Hormones have always been in normal range. I do not believe it is poly cystic.\n\nI have fought with low iron for most of my adult life. Birth control pills were not overly helpful. IUD was places less than three years ago. It took about 9 months, but then I did see significant improvement. For about a year and a half things were great/normal. My periods were still there, but regular and what would be considered normal for most people. In less than three years, efficiency is wearing off. Gyno is suggesting next step to be ablation.\n\n**Family History:**\n\nFather: Heart disease, diabetes in later life (life long smoker)\n\nP Grandmother: Diabetes in later life\n\nP Grandfather: Alzhimers\n\nP Half brother: Depression, suicide\n\nMother: My mother will not see doctors for anything less than life threatening problems. And even then it is a fight. I don't have a great medical history on her. I know she had heavy periods. I know she has always had a lot of heart burn. I know she has a tremor. She is currently progressing through some kind of dementia. Very paranoid about doctors and medicine.\n\nM Grandmother: Tremor. Early onset dementia of some kind. She was in a nursing home, locked unit by her mid 60s. Because of the dementia, nothing else was ever really followed up on. She passed in the late 1990s. No autopsy for any kind of diagnosis. During her decent into dementia she experienced significant paranoia and delusions. Once called 911 and told them that she was being held hostage in her home, despite being alone. She believed that my late teens sister pushed her off a swing.\n\nM Grandfather: Died fairly young from an infection in a VA hospital - late 1980s. No real known medical history\n\nM Uncle: Tremor, was diagnosed and treated for Parkinson's, had some dementia symptoms.\n\nM half Sister: Had to have thyroid removed after it became enlarged."""

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13m0ua8/question_about_clonidine_prescription_for/,b'Question about clonidine prescription for hypertension/anxiety',"b'My apologies for the oncoming wall of text. I was unsure of what in my medical history was pertinent. TLDR at the bottom for summary.\n\nI\'m a 34 year old white cisgendered male. Approximately 5\'11"" and 255 lbs with a history of hypertension and ulcerative colitis. I take 2.4 grams of mesalamine delayed release for the UC and two 25 mg metoprolol succ. extended release doses (one upon waking, the other around 5pm after work) for blood pressure. I take two 25mg doses instead of one 50mg dose because I had issues with the 50mg dose waking me up in the middle of the night with my heart pounding if I took it in the morning and coming home with bad headaches if I took it in the evening. I have been tapering on to buproprion (currently at 150 mg and going to 300 mg after 7 days) over the past two days. I have a mild marijuana usage (about one joint a night) and more heavy on the alcohol (4-5 pints of beer a day).\n\nAbout a month and a half ago, I had to find a new PCP due to outstanding debt. In the process there was some confusion and I was given metoprolol tartrate instead of the extended release succinate. At this time I started having panic attacks around the time I took my two doses of metropolol. They switched me back to the extended release about 3 weeks ago but the panic attacks haven\'t stopped and my blood pressure has spiked as high as 200/115 during the worst of them. I haven\'t had any stroke or other hypertensive crises symptoms beyond dizziness and anxiety during these attacks, no kind of physical pain or radiating numbness. I am in the process of finding a cardiologist.\n\nDuring one such attack a week ago today I was advised by a nurse to go to the ER. There they did the standard barrage of test, chest x-ray, EKG, bloodwork, etc. and couldn\'t find an abnormality. By the time I was fully admitted and under observation the attack had mostly subsided. They gave me a clonidine 0.1 mg prescription and instructed me to use it only when I was in danger of another hypertensive crisis. I informed my PCP of this and he gave the buproprion prescription to treat the anxiety on a more regular basis. He initially offered a weak extended release benzodiazapine (forgot the exact name) but I turned it down due to my history of alcohol use and hearing horror stories about how the two interact. My PCP reiterated the precaution to only use the clonidine sparingly and not regularly. He set a goal for trying to get my BP below 130 over 90 and so far outside the panic attacks it is slightly below 150/95.\n\nThis morning my blood pressure spiked about 1.5 hours after taking my metoprolol to a reading of 200 over 110 so I took one of the Clonidine 0.1mg pills the ER gave me. I was unaware and wasn\'t told that colnidine is also a benzo. My blood pressure has since subsided to 140 over 80 which is very effective compared to my other blood pressure management drugs and techniques.\n\nI guess my question is how often is too often for clonidine and am I in danger of another hypertensive crisis when it wears off? I figured one dose wouldn\'t cause withdrawals and I have no intention of touching alcohol for the next 8 hours but I wanted to get some kind of opinion. My PCP is closed on weekends otherwise I would be setting up a video call with him. \n\nI don\'t know if my anxiety is causing the blood pressure spikes or the other way around. I do have a lot of job related stress at the moment (I\'m a teacher limping along the finish line to summer vacation while rapidly applying to new schools because I didn\'t renew my contract at my current school due to the 140 mile daily commute). I\'m hoping these anxiety attacks and blood pressure spikes will ease once I am fully on the buproprion and I have my employment for next year secured but I am uncertain.\n\nTLDR: How often can a fat, 34 year old white male on beta blockers and with an alcohol habit of 5 pints a night take clonidine for hypertensive emergencies? What should I look for in terms of my panic attacks advancing on to legitimate concerns for my immediate health? Are there other things I can do during these hypertensive/anxiety attacks to manage my blood pressure outside of a benzo? I still have some metoprolol tartrate left I can take in emergencies.'"

Constipation, bloating, abdominal soreness, pain, etc. Throughout the years, the constipation stopped, but the other symptoms remained. The oddest, most important thing, however, is that my anal sphincters are not working properly. Although I pass some gas occasionally, most gas stays trapped inside. Even though I\'m relatively slim, I always have a distended belly and my sphincter is always irritated and tight. If I do some exercise or lift some weight, the sphincters always tightens but doesn\'t ""release"", it is always tense. Doing manual labor or working becomes, then, impossible. The only thing I can do is mild cardio like cycling and walking. Even running, which I used to do, is too much. The whole rectal area seems to be inflammed (although I did several tests and biopsies and the results are negative). Aside from that, I\'ve done endoscopies, colonoscopies and other image exams and everything seems okay in the results. I even did an anorectal manometry, but apparently, nothing wrong there either. Truth is, I don\'t really have problems pooping, but the sphincter is always tight despite bowels being empty or not. I\'ve tried strong stuff like linaclotide, a strong medication for constipation and it still didn\'t do anything about the sphincter. Also, the medication had the habit of not working one day and working the next, so I don\'t know how effective it could really be.\n\nAside from this, in the same rectal area, I\'ve had prostate issues as well. I\'ve had prostatitis in the law few months, which I suspect I\'ve had for a while, but the most relevant thing is that I ejaculate a lot less and with less pressure than before. Orgasms barely feel like anything and leave me even more tired. My prostate also feels irritated and sore, even after antibiotics. So it seems the sphincter in this area is also affected as well.\n\nI am always dead tired, always heavy, numb, sore. Always exhausted, as if I was sedated or poisoned by something. My cognition wasn\'t exactly genius-level before, but I managed. But it has gone completely downhill. My head seems to be burning often, I can\'t focus on anything, everything is nauseating and too much effort. Can\'t focus on a show or a read a book, my brain is always on fire and I feel like laying down. Also, being my intestines affected, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are an absolute no, because they hurt my stomach and intestines. I\'ve also taken probiotics and they make everything even worse, so no luck there either.\n\nMy life has been put on hold because of this and it robbed me of much of any joy in life. Given the lack of results or evidence, most doctors don\'t care much about it and are largely indifferent and think it\'s something psychossomatic, which I know it is not, given my experience. But I can\'t afford to go to private practicioners and do exams on the private sector, given the cost.\n\nThese symptoms also started after I took a supplement I bought online, so there is a temporal link, though I\'m not sure if that\'s a coincidence. I don\'t know what supplement could do this much damage to an organ and not affect the rest...\n\nSo I\'m basically out of options, thefore I come here just to throw in my story. Someone who dealt with weird stuff might have a clue or some info that might help. Or so I hope.'"

Over those years I went all the way up to 30 mgs plus 15 PRN, but PRN turned into every time. As you know 45 mgs is 15mgs over the recommended FDA dose. Years went by and my tolerance went up and 45 mgs no longer had an effect and I began to have crippling insomnia, until lasy May when my Provider, an NP, told me the behavioral health clinic could no longer dispense that much and I had a forced decrease down to 30mg. Of course, my provider and I worked on a plan to taper off of it. I discovered that the manufacturer's dose of temazepam, being 30, 22.5, 15, and 7.5 mean that switching down means a huge decreased dose. I did the best i could to tolerate it for a full year up until March, (it is May, now), but it is too much to tolerate. I find myself doubling up on my doses....which is terrible....but I cannot tolerate the rebound insomnia and the anxiety and withdrawal. I am bound to keep abusing them. There has to be another way.\n\nI have been so honest with my Provider about this, in every way, but when I tell her that there has to be a better way than to continue to do this, she doesn't appear to be aware of any other method than this taper. I am aware of the Ashton Manual, the substitution of temazepam which I have a dependence on, to an equal amount in a longer acting benzo like Valium, which I am not dependent on. I got a second opinion with a doctor, the supervisor of my provider, who suggested something like this. My provider is clearly not comfortable with this, but on a cost/benefit standpoint, I know that the current plan is a perfect storm for failure. I do not have the luxury of doing this inpatient. I looked into a compounding pharmacy. Ifound one in my state that was willing to do a controlled substance but the price.... so expensive and so prolonged. My insurance won't pay for it. \n\nMy question is, how can I convince my provider to consider the Ashton Manual? Is it a sound plan, or is it appropriate for me to even ask (and not look like I'm seeking drugs). Are there other methods besides inpatient, that I can ask about?"""
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13ls21t/recurrent_toddler_croup/,b'Recurrent Toddler Croup',"b'I have a 3 year old who gets croup nearly every other month. Seal cough, stridor, halfway out the door to the ER each time it gets bad enough that it feels like hes struggling to breathe. Its been this way since he was just over 1 year. Every cold and virus ends up in croup for him. Asthma has been ruled out. \n\nWe got the decadron steroid each time initially. There was a stretch where he got the steroid once every month for 4 months. I was eventually pulled aside by my primary doctor, who told me that this many doses oral steroids would eventually begin impact his growth. \n\nWe went to an ENT, who scoped him - everything was normal. He prescribed nebulizer budesonide 1x to 2x per day as a preventative. Albuterol nebulizer for a rescue. Inhaled steroids impact growth less than oral steroids, he says. So budesonide nebulizer has become a part of our routine for the past 4 months. \n\nKid continues to get croup. I went and got a second opinion. Doctor #2 tells me Doctor #1 is wrong - says budesonide and Albuterol are asthma drugs meant for the lower lung lobes. Drugs like this are not effective for upper airway issues, like croup. She tells me breathing issues trump any other issues, and Decadron should be administered every time. She added that even every month is probably not enough to impact growth. Ive gotten two more doctor opinions, all disagree on an answer. \n\nI know my kid will outgrow this. Aside from cool air, humidifers, Motrin, and honey - how do I handle this? I feel like Ive hit a wall with doctors, Im now 4+ opinions deep, and there is no clear answer on how to help my kid. I have a referral to a Pulminologist and cant get in for 4 months, so thats coming but certainly no help currently. Thank you all!'"

Since starting it I noticed it hurts my stomach, even if I take it with food, causes headaches, general dizziness, and worse of all gives me brain fog. I tried searching online for side effects & all I could find was stomach issues. All I could find on interactions is taking it with antihistamines *in theory* might make one or the other ineffective.\n\nI take a stimulant for ADHD most days & thought maybe the Betahistine is reducing the effect of that someone (one is a vasodilator and one is a vasoconstrictor, for example). Called pharmacy & all they could say is that they don\'t *see* any interactions but that there isn\'t a lot of info on the drug so all they know about it is what\'s available to them -- that is scary to me...\n\nI\'m wondering if any doctors here have an opinion on Betahistine and whether or not it sounds plausible that it would interact with ADHD meds. Additionally, from all my personal research I found that Betahistine is concluded to not have sufficient evidence for being effective for Meniere\'s, though some studies show higher doses are better than placebo (though the data isn\'t very reliable). Since I am on such a low dose & already have side effects, I don\'t think it would be possible for me to be on a potentially therapeutic dose.'"

I am a 22 year old female, not a smoker, rarely drinking, no drugs. I weigh 135lbs and I am 55. I frequently exercise.\n\nI have had chronic low back pain since I was 13/14 years old. I have played competitive softball my whole life all the way through college. I had no major back injuries, just muscle strains/tears in my low back. D/t the pain, I saw ortho spine in 2015 who ordered an MRI. I got an MRI w/o contrast (age 14) and these were the findings/impression: \n\nFINDINGS:\nSagittal images extend from T11 through S2. Axial images were obtained from L1 through S1. Five lumbar-type\nvertebral bodies are assumed.\nSpinal alignment is normal. There are no acute fractures. The vertebral bodies are normal in height. Marrow signal is normal. There is no abnormal signal in the visible distal spinal cord. The conus medullaris terminates at mid L2, lower than average. The paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable. \n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No spinal canal stenosis, significant neural foraminal stenosis, or disc herniation. Mild facet arthropathy lower lumbar spine.\nNormal conus signal.\n3. No suspicious bright STIR signal within the bones or ligaments\n\nI have done several rounds of PT and massage, as well as trigger point injections. The pain was pretty consistent while I was playing softball until COVID hit and I could no longer play. After I stopped playing in 2020, the pain was markedly better for about a year until I started my new job in April of 2021 (MA at high volume FP/OB clinic) and the pain started to return. The pain was daily, and was at its worse when I would sit. I couldnt sit for more than 5 minutes without pretty bad pain in my low back, more on my right side and intermittent pain down the leg. After 8 months of dealing with daily pain, I went back to the same ortho doc I saw in 2015. Since I have good insurance, I was able to get an MRI before doing PT (even tho I did PT/massage anyways.) These were the findings from my MRI on 12/3/21 (21 years old) :\n\nFINDINGS: The vertebrae demonstrate normal alignment and bone marrow signal. Moderate disc desiccation is noted from the L4-S1 levels with diffuse disc bulge at each level, moderately progressed since the 4/6/2015 study. The conus is normal terminating at the inferior L1 level.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Moderate degenerative disc disease from L4 through S1 with mild spinal canal stenosis at both levels, slightly worse on the right at L4/5 with possible contact of the descending right L5 nerve root.\n\nSince I was symptomatic with the pain, we opted to do an epidural steroid injection in January of 2022 (along with PT/massage.) This massively helped and pretty much eliminated the pain- until now. The same pain has returned, worse with sitting. I know the ESIs are variable in how long the effects last so I am happy it lasted this long. \n\nMy questions are: \n-How often are people my age diagnosed with degenerative disc disease?\n-Could I potentially be a candidate for a lumbar disc replacement? Or will I have to continue getting ESIs?\n-Is there anything I can do to slow the progression down? Or will my spine be disintegrated by the time Im 40 (lol.)\n-At what point does this become a neurosurgery problem vs ortho spine. \n\nThank you again for taking the time to read my post and I appreciate any insight.'"

I have been to countless doctors and specialists the past 3 years doing nothing but tests of all sorts. I spend every single day worrying about my health and completing ocd routines to make myself not get sick. Its exhausting to say the least. I am going to be as detailed as humanly possible and Im sorry if it seems like I am rambling. \n\nI am a 28 year old male, I weigh roughly 215 pounds and just over 6 ft tall. I have been obese/morbidly obese my whole life until 2021. At my biggest, I was roughly 360 pounds. Since a child I have had asthma, depression, anxiety, and OCD. I havent treated the asthma in years, but I feel as if I might need to again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DX:**\n\n* \\-Asthma\n* \\-Chronic Sinusitis (confirmed on multiple MRIs across a 3 year span)\n* \\-Panic Disorder, GAD, OCD, PTSD (Possible Convergence Disorder)\n* \\-Still currently testing for neurological/autoimmune disorder\n* \\-Bilateral Intermediate Granulomatous Uveitis\n* \\-Vitamin D Deficiency\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other possible relevant medical instanc**es \n\n* \\-Two concussions\n* Dart was lodged in my back when I was 17\n* Either stung by scorpion or bit by spider in my sleep which resulted in enlarged arm and severe pain\n* Possible overdose on clenbuterol in high school when someone gave me a full syringe full to lose weight. \n\n**My medications I take include** \n\n* Omeprazole 20 mg (Tapering from 40 mg) ED\n* Lorazepam .5 mg as needed\n* Prednisolone Acetate Suspension Drops ED\n* Flonase\n* Vitamin D3\n\n**Smoking Status:**\n\n* 1 pack a day from 18-22\n* Heavy vape user from 22-28 (Quit 3 months ago)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Past Drug Use:** \n\n* Cannabis: Heavy user for about 7 years\n* Alcohol: binge drinker throughout college. After graduation social/weekend drinker. Currently I rarely drink\n* Cocaine: somewhat regular for 3 years in college. Mainly weekends. Also sprinkled it on marijuana blunts so I guess I technically smoked crack\n* Nitrous/LSD/Shrooms/Ecstasy: occasional I would say, but not recreational.

The neurologist said he suspected a convergence spasm that gave me nystagmus. \n\n**About a week later, the left side of my face became extremely weak and practically paralyzed so I went to the hospital. Apparently I suffered a neurological attack caused by demyelinating plaques scattered in various white matter regions of my brain.**  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brain MRI**\n\nThe cerebral parenchyma shows multifocal discrete areas of increased signal.

These areas show mild facilitated diffusion. There is no associated mass effect. Following infusion of contrast agent, there is significant enhancement of the lesion in the right periventricular white matter and right supraverntricular white matter with faint enhancement in the pontine tegmenjtum.\n\n**Spinal MRI**\n\n* Congenital Spinal Stenosis\n* Mild Disc bulge at T11-T12\n* Minimal Disc bulges at L4-L5\n* Mild disc bulge and small broad based protruding central disc herniation at L5-S1\n* Mild multilevel facet arthropathy\n\n**Chest Xray**\n\n\\-Unremarkable\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT Angio Head And Neck**\n\nUnremarkable/No Stenosis/ No aneurysm\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lumbar Puncture**\n\n\\-There were no O bands in my spinal fluid, and the only abnormal finding was nonspecific mild elevation of protein.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BLOOD TESTS**\n\nLyme, CRP, ANA, ACE, Sed Rate, Treponema Pallidum, Hep B, JC virus, Myelin Basic Protein, MOG Antibody, NMO/AQP4 all fell within normal range or negative\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TREATMENT**\n\nI was treated with high dose IV steroids for about 5 days in total and my face went back to normal about 95%. About two months later my double vision subsided, but I now developed light sensitivity and floaters. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**REMAINING SYMPTOMS**\n\n* Headaches compatible with Migraine, especially upon exertion of my neck. Just laying flat on my pillow or sitting up in my bed will give me a migraine behind my eyes and in the back of my head. Often times on one side of my head, other times like a headband.\n* Tinnitus\n* Floaters\n* Cold hands and feet \n* Back Pain\n* Reflux since February\n* Chest Cartilage Pain/Burning (relieved temporarily upon cracking sternum)\n* Occasional Dizziness and almost the feeling of like Im not in control of my body\n\nMy neurologist sees no need to further test anything. My opthamologist suspected neurosarcoidosis and I just recently retested ANA but it came back negative again. After the initial brain MRI, I would receive them every 6 months and each one got better. The lesion in the pons has cleared up, and smaller lesions have appeared in other white matter locations. I have another follow up with him in October.\n\nAm I Just destined to be left in Limbo? Not knowing what happened to me and living in fear of symptoms reappearing has made me feel terrible. My contamination OCD, anxiety, and stress levels have been through the roof. I am unable to relax. I wash my hands upwards of 20 times per day, I disinfect my phone whenever I leave my home, Im afraid of anything positive happening in my life due to the fear of something shitty happening right after. I lost my mother when I was 18, my sister in 2020, and my dad last year. I really only have myself because my grandmother is in Florida and I have to be strong for my grandfather who was just recently diagnosed with aggressive lymphoma. I have been taking him to his appointments and will be taking him to chemo. Its just hard when I see so many different doctors without answers. So far Ive seen 3 neurologists, 4 eye doctors, Endocrinologist, without any solid answers. Its frustrating. I am extremely grateful that nothing debilitating was found, but I want to know how to heal my symptoms. Did we cover all of the bases? Did we miss anything?'"

(I hope this is the right place to ask) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Short version :** \n\nI lied to my doctor about taking medication she prescribed, and I'm wondering what's the worst that could happen.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Long version :** \n\nWhen I was in my early 20s, I lost my mom to cancer. I was very numb for a year, it was hard. My GP prescribed anti-depressant and I try different therapist with that. I didn't feel like the psy was helping, so I stop going. After a while of taking the pills, I felt numb. Actually, no, I wasn't feeling any emotions. My soul was dead, and I was just like a body, walking and doing automatic stuff. After I realized that, I decided to ditch the pills. I told my doctors a year or two after. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCouple years later, I went through a very bad breakup, and losing all my friends at the same time. I was struggling with wanting to stay alive. Same GP gave me new meds. These meds were terrible at first with side effect, but eventually, my body got use to it, and I felt way better. I took these pills (Welbutrin) for about 2-3 years. Then I moved to another country and I didn't take them every day like I was suppose to. I talked to a pharmacist, that told me, basically, the pills didn't do anything, the way I was taking them. So I ditched them (that was right before the pandemic, and I did surprisingly good during the pandemic, even after coming back home and leaving my dream of living in that other country, losing my job due to covid etc.) \n\nAlso, for additional information, I have a bpd diagnostic, I don't smoke, or take drugs and I don't really drink.  \n\nAfter couple of months home, I found a new job and move out of province. This job was fine at first, but we changed management after a year and the new management was a bit toxic. I stayed longer than I should have and this mixed with my living condition, always working extra hours and trying to earn more money through side line job (more work), burnt me out. \n\nThis job had benefits, and I wanted to use all my sick days before quitting, so I went to see my GP to ask for a sick leave. (I didn't lie about that, when I started taking about my job and my situation there, I got very emotional, I couldn't stop crying. I then realize it was *that bad*.) My GP gave me couple weeks of sick leave, but also prescribed Wellbutrin, again. I went to buy them, but I didn't take them, like I was suppose to.  I might be wrong, but personally I believe that, once removed from the bad living situation, changing job, coming back to my home province, and TIME, will solve the burnt out feeling. \n\nMy GP said, there's probably something wrong in my brain, and my brain can't produce something to keep me happy. I think that if I work on my situation, I will feel better. I don't think I need medication.\n\nMy GP did mention that I'll need to take these pills for at least 3 years, and then, if I relapse, I'll have to take them for the rest of my life. Just the thought of having to take a pill to feel normal, make me sick to my stomach and make me want to unalive myself because I don't want to live like that, I'd much rather work on myself, even if that mean a ton of changes and lot of hours invested in myself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is, what's the worst that could happen about me lying about taking the pills? \n\nCould GP refuse to see me, or to help me in the future? \n\nGP also sent me for blood work, and I am wondering if, she can see from my blood, that I'm not taking the pills... Obviously, GP can't force me to take the pills, but I'm wondering, what's could happen...\n\n. \n. \n. \n\nUpdate : I got another follow up with my doctor. I confess that I never took the pills she prescribed, and that I was hoping to get better by getting help with a therapist instead of taking pills. She wasn't mad like I expected her to be, she said I know myself better than her and if I believed that not taking the pills and getting help was best for me, then it was ok.  Huge relief.\n\nThank you to the person that said something like gp can't advise to take pills for x time, because they don't know, that recalled helped me to come clean to her. I don't want to be a slave of pills, and I much rather work on myseld to fix my issues than depending on pills."""

No other medications at this time. I do not smoke, I drink infrequently, maybe 4 drinks total per month and there are many months where I do not drink at all depending on my schedule. I do not use any drugs nor have I ever used drugs. I am from and living in the United States. Primary complaint is numbness and tingling throughout my body including the face, hands, feet, neck etc..muscle twitching, and widespread pain.   \nHello, I recently had MRIs done on my brain, my cervical spine, and my thoracic spine, each done w/ and w/o contrast. Per the radiologist and my neurologist who ordered the MRIs, everything came back ""normal."" More specifically, the neurologist said, ""Notify: All 3 MRIs are normal. No MS or related diseases found. Very reassuring."" The reason why I was referred to the neurologist in the first place is because I have been experiencing numbness and tingling in face, hands, feet, and also intermittent muscle twitching throughout my body, everything from my eyelids, to my eyebrows, to my leg muscles, muscles in my buttocks, arms you name it, and overall pain throughout my body. I\'ve had a myriad of other tests done and everything has come back normal.  \nWhat troubles me is the language used by the radiologist in his report. Rather than simply saying there is nothing wrong, he uses language like ""no significant abnormalities."" I just recently graduated from law school, so the word smith in me makes me question does that mean that nothing is wrong, or what exactly is significant--i.e., is that simply the standard phraseology that the radiologist would use.  \nBelow in copy are the reports from the radiologist for the MRIs of my brain, my cervical spine and also my thoracic spine.  \nBRAIN W/ AND W/O CONTRAST:  \nImpression  \nNo significant intracranial abnormalities.  \nEXAMINATION:  \nMRI BRAIN DEMYELINATING W/ WO CONTRAST  \nCLINICAL HISTORY:  \nPain in thoracic spine  \nTECHNIQUE:  \nMultiplanar multisequence MR imaging of the brain was performed before and after the administration of 6 mL Gadavist intravenous contrast.  \nCOMPARISON:  \nNone  \nFINDINGS:  \nNo midline shift, hydrocephalus or mass effect. Brain parenchyma is normal in overall signal and contour. No evidence of advanced T2/FLAIR signal abnormality within the supratentorial white matter. No acute infarction. No acute or large remote infarct. No abnormal intracranial enhancing lesions or abnormal extra-axial fluid collections. Structures in the sellar region and craniocervical junction show no significant abnormalities. The major skull base flow voids are present. There is mild mucosal membrane thickening in the paranasal sinuses. Orbits show no significant abnormalities. Mastoid air cells are essentially clear.  \nWhat I don\'t understand about this one is language like ""essentially clear,"" no evidence of ADVANCED T2/Flair (does that mean there IS some that is not advanced or do they just always say advanced because that is what would occur in MS?), ""No ABNORMAL intracranial enhancing lesions or ABNORMAL extra-axial....again, no abnormal? Is that just standard language or is that indicating that I do in fact have some of those things and is that a bad thing.  \nMRIs 2 and 3, CERVICAL SPINE AND THORACIC SPINE WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  \nImpression  \nMRI of the cervical and thoracic spine shows no significant abnormalities. (Why no SIGNIFICANT abnormalities rather than just no abnormalities?)  \nNarrative  \nEXAMINATION:  \nMRI CERVICAL SPINE DEMYELINATING W W/O CONTRAST; MRI THORACIC SPINE DEMYELINATING W W/O CONTRAST  \nCLINICAL HISTORY:  \nPain in thoracic spine  \nTECHNIQUE:  \nMRI of the cervical and thoracic spine pre and post contrast according to the white matter protocol. 6 mL of IV Gadavist was administered in conjunction with MRI of the brain which was performed on a separate acquisition.  \nCOMPARISON:  \nNone  \nFINDINGS:  \nCervical spine:  \nNo fracture or marrow replacement process.

I'll explain below.\n\nI have binge eating disorder. But I have been following the keto diet on and off for a couple of years. The two aren't really compatible and really depend on my mental health (severe anxiety, depression). Mental health bad = binge eating; mental health slightly less bad = motivation to follow diet and be more healthy overall.\n\nLately my mental health has been bad, but my desire to not regain more of the weight I lost has had me trying to follow the diet anyway. And I found a middle ground, kind of.\n\nI found some no added sugar chocolate that I can have in small amounts. Ideally, two squares a day (20g). I'm currently eating five squares a day (half a 100g bar) and still kind of be OK. Except *really*, I'm secretly eating another bar and a half (150g) at night, when alone. I've been trying to fool myself into thinking I'm not *really* bingeing because there's no added sugar and it's 'healthier' (a 'normal' binge is much, much more food).\n\nBut of course no added sugar = added sweetener = laxative. And the more chocolate, the more of a laxative effect. On top of IBS (D). So eating it at night, before bed, means I can either: a. stay up all night so I can run to the toilet; or b. soil the bed. But neither of these appealed so I discovered/invented c: taking lots of Imodium to counteract the laxatives.\n\nI'm no addict/abuser, so I don't just take a whole bunch of them at once. That would be stupid. I would take two (the recommended dose after a loose bowel movement) straight after I finished eating the chocolate. Then I would take another two (sometimes one) every now and then when I remembered/my belly made noises. This could be over a time period of between one and six hours depending on many factors. Usually closer to two or three. I would usually have one to three bowel movements in this time, after which I would again take the recommended dose of two pills, or just one if it was smaller.\n\nNow, I haven't been taking enough to get any kind of high. And nor would I. But I have been taking at least double the maximum recommended dose in a reasonably short space of time most nights, sometimes every night for weeks at a time, for about six months. Maybe a little longer? On top of taking them appropriately for my IBS.\n\nThis weekend, I stopped. Stopped with the chocolate (except the half a bar a day) and therefore stopped with the Imodium (except for actually using it properly to treat IBS, and definitely staying below the max. dose). Because I knew I was just taking the piss.\n\nBut all this week, so far, I've been feeling unwell. Moreso than usual, which has been going on for months and, until tonight, I had attributed to 'long Covid'. But just before I started writing this post, I realised also coincided with the Imodium misuse. So now I'm wondering if I've been making myself ill with side effects from the medication, with this week's increase in severity being some kind of withdrawal.\n\n**TL;DR version, could taking too much Imodium long-term cause these side effects (and could they worsen through withdrawal):**\n\nIncreased anxiety/depression, especially after waking\n\nExtreme fatigue despite 6-9 hours sleep (barely functioning when under 8 hours)\n\nMore frequent migraines (gone from just a few a year to several a month)\n\nDays/weeks of nausea and dizzy spells following migraines (not a usual symptom, only happened once before)\n\nTrembling\n\nCold-like symptoms, especially runny nose and eyes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny help would be appreciated.

I had a very swollen throat, so much so I was only able to get a few cheerios in at a time, I was hungry and frustrated so I hard-swallowed a large scoop down past the swollen throat.. at that exact moment, a spot ""began"" larger than a point, smaller than a fingerprint, I go back and forth on whether to use the term pop, as I didn\'t feel a ""pop"" but the immediate beginning of a small localized sensation.  Over the next day and a half or so that sensation spot got larger to where it felt like it encompassed most of the left hand side of my upper-mid head.  At that point I went to emergency, explained to the doctor and she tested my balance, and basically just made sure I wasn\'t going to fall over, no actual looking at my head in any way... she said it should clear up, I asked her what if it doesn\'t and she dismissively said ""it should"" and then the visit was over..  That sensation grew to encompass my whole upper/mid head, over the course of the next few days... I basically continued life as normal.. mostly sedentary.  The feeling never went away... for a few years there was essentially no ""effect"" except for a ""weird"" feeling/sensation in my head...  \n\nTimes when I didn\'t hydrate properly, ate too much sugar.. those times had a permanent worsening/increasing the noticable-ness of the sensation, only a little, but if it was a longer time, it has a worse perment effect on the senation..  At some point ""just"" weirdness became pressure and foggyness and swimmyness an d eventually pain.   Increases in blood pressure worsened symptoms as well.\n\nI\'ve recently been to the doc again due to a maximal sinus infection, which I need dental work for.. but I cannot lay back, I can\'t lean back in my computer chair without the symptoms immediately worsening, I lean back for a moment, maybe 5-15 degrees and get a half hour head ache..   I am taking quite a lot of advil for the teeth pain and have for awhile.. the advil also generally knocks out most of the most noticable head symptoms, however with increased use with the teeth pain, more advil seems to make the head symptoms worse.. specically pain more than the others.\n\nI am trying to convey whats happening with my head to the doctors, my own family one and the ER doc.. but they are seemingly waving away the head thing.. they just don\'t know what it is and don\'t seem to concerned.. which is weird cause to me, Im basically telling them I\'m pretty sure Im having something akin to a brain bleed...\n\nI got a CT scan and they say it doesn\'t show any thing like that... however.. the ""bleed"" started like 9 years ago and was small... I looked up pics of CAT scans and I wonder, could it be that what they are seeing is actually my blood where it shouldnt be, but they can\'t see the small hole and since there isn\'t any real difference between the front/back/left/right anymore, nothing is standing out as a ""bleed""\n\nThank you very much, kinda at my wits end with this all..'"

Everything went great and I was pain-free in the months following the surgery. \n\nHowever, unfortunately I had a severe side-effect of a procedure (I had Radiofrequency ablation performed on a thyroid nodule and it ruptured) and needed x2 7-day courses of Augmentin (a couple of weeks apart). \n\nEver since approx. halfway into the first week of Augmentin, I had a pain in my right flank which reminded me of the gallbladder pain I had when my gallbladder remained intact. I asked my GP (who prescribed the antibiotics for an abscess that had formed due to the rupture) and she told me to continue with the antibiotics despite this pain. \n\nUnfortunately, 6 months after finishing my last antibiotic, I have been left with pain similar to gallbladder attacks that radiates to my right shoulder. It doesnt seem to be going away which is unfortunate. \n\nAfter doing some of my own investigation, it appears that Augmentin can have bad consequences for the liver and bile ducts. However, strangely, my liver bloods look fine (they always have even when I was having gallbladder problems last year). \n\nI visited my local emergency department in December and they told me it was more than likely drug induced Cholestasis and that it would take one month to disappear. The surgeon that removed my gallbladder told me this diagnosis was unlikely as my bloods looked fine and that I should go on an antidepressant to reduce pain (absolutely not an option - I know when there is something wrong and this is definitely a symptom of something that the Augmentin has done). \n\nFollowing some research, it appears that drug induced liver injury comes in many forms but im wondering why this is taking so long to go away and why I cant find a lot of evidence about it (there is some but it seems to be pretty rare, whatever is going on).

Could it be something else considering my bloods look ok?\n\nTLDR: has anyone ever experienced long-term bilary pain after taking an antibiotic and if so, how long does it take to resolve?'"

Can I call her and let her know what I have been doing (taking a higher dose than prescribed) and ask her to change my prescription to the higher dose of specifically 20 mg, or would that be frowned upon?'"

Occasional clonazepam for triggers of trauma but it\'s been at least a year. Benadryl to sleep sometimes, 75 mg. Metoprolol 25 mg a fee times a month for menstrual cycle linked paroxysmal tachycardia. No smoking or vaping. No recreational drug use. \n\nLast winter I was on Prozac for winter depression. My dad was also diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Usually 20 mg Prozac from Oct to March worked ok but last year it would help for 5 or 6 days and I\'d go back to baseline depression. They upped my dose to 60 mg. They wanted to put me on 80 but I said I wanted to be able to process what was going on w my dad. He died in May and I was still on 60 mg. My in laws were being emotionally abusive but I was so out of it I didn\'t realize and I ended up having a kind of nervous breakdown when I was staying with them about a month later. I was hospitalized for a day (idk why though I wasn\'t expressing intent to harm self or others and I was capable of basic things like hygiene and nutrition, I was just talkative and labile and really angry.) I was put on respiridone which caused or aggravated a pituitary adenocarcinoma which caused galactorrhre. I still have it, it\'s smaller now though and no galactorrhea and I\'m waiting to see my neurologist. So they took me off that and after getting my history from the US decided that what they thought was hypomania was just ADHD and grief and they stopped the Prozac too over a few weeks in case it was causing disturbances. Then in July I came back to the states and found a much better psychiatrist who put me back on my previous adderall dosage and low dose wellbutrin, 150 SR. In December I felt some dysthymia so he increased the dose of wellbutrin, I felt a lot better on 300 SR. At the start of March I became edgy and labile, we decided to taper wellbutrin to 100 a day or to cessate, as it does bolster stimulant treatment. 3 weeks later, 100 mg once daily (short release not extended) was still causing anxiety and tearfullness and extreme irritability so today I decided to just ditch it (I have permission for this, I took 100 mg once a day for 5 days.) \n\nEmotionally I am in a much better place. Not in distress or dissociative or anything, maybe apathy and anhedonia. But physically, I am so fatigued I can barely move from bed to the next room without feeling drained. There is pronounced orthostasis, a level 6 headache radiating into eyes and massager and serratus anterior. I have chills, am nauseous, feel feverish but my temperature is normal range. \n\nI remember feeling a less intense form if this after stopping Prozac for the first time a decade ago. But I\'m also aware that ndri\'s are notoriously uncomfortable to discontinue. My psychiatrist did warn me I might experience some physical withdrawal effects, but to call him if I suspect anything unusual. (I am a psychiatrist myself.) I\'m aware that all these symptoms can be expected from ndri withdrawal, but experiencing them is an intense experience and after 6 years of what\'s considered a somewhat high intake of dopamine agonists I\'m a bit taken aback. I left my provider a voice-mail. But I wanted to get some opinions here, because maybe I\'m also not thinking straight due to withdrawal. Does my scenario read as alarming?'"

I worry that happened to me.\n\n\\--\n\nI was misdiagnosed with bipolar when I was 16. My late mom had it so I guess that\'s why my psychiatrist assumed I did; she knew my crazy alcoholic dad and I guess didn\'t take into consideration that abuse + my mom\'s suicide could have been a cause of my psych issues. Now as an adult I\'ve been diagnosed with PTSD and ADHD and it makes way more sense with my symptoms, and I have no mood swings or hypo/manic symptoms at all. I do sometimes have ""depressive episodes"" but that seems much more related to trauma and it\'s manageable without meds.\n\nI was on 1,200 mg of lithium for 4-5 years. I had a lot of side effects- severe hand tremors, constant brain fog, weight gain, extreme thirst (sometimes I\'d wake up 5x a night gasping for water and would chug so much I\'d throw up, still very thirsty). I also would have hypomanic symptoms when I skipped doses, but never again when I discontinued taking it completely. On lithium I attempted suicide multiple times, feeling like a zombie, constantly depressed.\n\nI was also prescribed antipsychotics (Risperdal and Abilify) on and off for ""bipolar with psychotic features"", which later turned out to be a combination of hypervigilance and vivid flashbacks. On these meds I gained 90 lbs (which I lost quickly when I stopped taking them) and felt like I couldn\'t think at all; I literally couldn\'t read at times. I have almost no memories of the times on those drugs.\n\nStopped taking lithium 3-4 years ago. I feel a lot of brain fog still, and I have issues with long lasting dissociation and extremely poor memory retention. I understand ADHD and PTSD can both cause this. I have clinically impaired level mental processing speed while my other cognitive processes function at a level in the top 1 %ile according to a neuropsych/IQ test given by a neuropsychologist. Do you think taking such a high dose at such a young age could have caused me some cognitive impairment or other damage?'"

I know that ovaries already have all the eggs when we are born, and then they mature each cycle, so what is up with that? are all the pills in the package the same or do they each have certain levels of each hormone? why do different brands have such crazy different secondary effects on the same people even when the active ingredients are technically the same? what is the ""period"" that we get on the free week?\n\nI am asking this not just out of curiosity, but also because I have been on the combined pill (ethinilestradiol 0.03mg drosisprenone 3mg) for over a year now. I started because I went to the gynaecologist for some crazy irregular periods that were so stupid painful I was puking and bending over in pain and 500mg naproxen (strongest thing you can get otc in Spain) was taking two or three hours to reduce the pain to a level where I could like, you know, stand up. gyno did a transvaginal ultrasound and told me I had polycystic ovary, which would also explain why acne has been my best friend for over 15 years now. And so I went on the pill to control symptoms. Now here is where my questions come from, other than just general interest:\n\n\\-I tried one brand: got severely depressed. tried a second brand: had random breakthrough bleeding and period symptoms for five months, even on week one of each pack. tried a third brand and now I\'m very happy with it: no weird symptoms (I think). they all have the same actives and list the same secondary effects, but affected me crazy differently. I have friends that refuse to change brands because of similar experiences. why is this?\n\n\\-I used to not have many pre-period symptoms, other than deadly cramping for sometimes weeks before I got my period (and maybe worse acne but like that was bad unless I was on accutane). Now, I have sore boobs for a week and a half before the bleeding week, I get super bloated for a few days, cramps are better than before but I still need a naproxen or two each cycle, and the mood swings? horrible! I get angry and nothing and cry at nothing too. I didn\'t have these or if I did they were super subtle before I went on the pill, and I\'m wondering: if the pill is supposed to keep your hormones from cycling normally, why am I getting all of these symptoms? it almost feels like now that I am on the pill I am having ""normal"" hormonal cycles.\n\nany insight would be appreciated, there are tons and tons of info on the internet but most of it is super basic and doesn\'t actually explain much.

I am writing this as my last desperate way of hearing someone elses opinion or maybe a helpful suggestion since not a single soul has been able to help me and I dont know what to do and how long I can bear this anymore.\n\n**A quick insight:**\n\n27M, 5 \'10 from Bosnia, around 165 lbs, non-smoker, no alcohol, physically active with calisthenics (was), no terminal illness, free from meds, no recreational drugs, not practicing specific nutrition.\n\n**Previous issues related to the feet:**\n\nA year long battle with flexor hallucis longus tendinopathy in the left foot which caused heavy limping on the right foot the whole time. Finally fixed with ESWT around 6 months before current issues arrived and I was walking normally until then and also wearing custom made insoles to this day.\n\n**Level of activity before the heel pain started:**\n\nA bit of walking and driving a bicycle.\n\nNo prolonged standing or walking great distances, no running, no heavy lifting, no injury or trauma.\n\n**Symptoms description:**\n\nAt first the pain was present only in my left heel right under the center of the calcaneus and along the outer edge of the heel and sole. Heel was swollen every night. After a month of hard limping, it appeared the exact same way on the right heel and became way way worse there. As the time went on, the pain slowly but surely spread and got worse and continued that trend to this day.\n\nAll kinds of sensations are present: rarely sharp, mostly dull and achy, occasionally burning, sometimes pins and needles. Surface pain, irritation and burning which is amplified by cold feet and having literally anything on my feet e.g. socks (that\'s why I must be barefoot when resting or in shoes all the time). Sometimes the heels are just too sensitive to even touch them with anything. Also, deep pain like it\'s in a bone is sometimes felt. The pain is still mainly located in/around the heels but is spread to the side and back of the heels, side of the sole and foot (around the cuboid bone area I think?). All this can radiate through the whole foot, sometimes it even starts to climb up through the ankle into the calf muscle. Sometimes I can push hard with my fingers into the heel fat pad and not provoke pain but also feel that some type of pain is present there, hard to explain. Walking barefoot is literally impossible. Walking in cushioned shoes is tolerable enough only for a few minutes before the discomfort and pain takes over. The pain is present at rest when sitting and sometimes even when lying. So it\'s literally 24/7 in one form or another.\n\n**Scans and tests:**\n\n*X-ray on both feet*: no apparent issues\n\n*MRI of the right foot:* inflammation and oedema under the heel bone of a surface area 2.5 cm (around 1 inch), subluxation deformity at the level of the calcaneocuboid joint.\n\nUrl: [https://imgur.com/a/mOo9dRc](https://imgur.com/a/mOo9dRc)\n\n*MRI of the left foot:* inflammation and oedema under the heel bone, signs of initial atrophy of the heel fat pad which is about 1 cm (about 0.4 inches) thick, very very slight subluxation just like in the right foot, unfused posterior process of the talus (os trigonum)\n\n*EMNG of both legs:* chronic radicular lesions by myotomes L5 dex medium severe degree, L5 sin mild degree, S1 dex medium severe degree, S1 sin mild to medium severe degree. Denervation potentials are not registered. Prolonged latency time for motor response n.tibialis bill.\n\n*MRI of the lower spine:* no apparent issues\n\n*Blood and urine laboratory tests:* everything is clean and properly in the reference range\n\n**Doctors and their opinions:**\n\nI\'ve visited over 10 different medical professionals, mainly orthopedic surgeons but also physiatrist, rheumatologist, neurologist, spinal surgeon and I\'ve gotten very little out of them.\n\nAt first I was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis but soon enough that diagnosis was concluded as incorrect. The most common answer I\'d get from them was ""I don\'t know what causes your pain"". Unfortunately, many of them were not interested at all in getting into the issue and could hardly wait for the appointment to end.\n\nSome orthopedists stated that subluxation does not play a role in my heel/foot pain and that this is most likely some neurological problem linked to the lower spine.\n\nLast orthopedist said that subluxation is most likely the main culprit for the majority of pain in my right (worse) heel/foot since it apparently changed how forces and pressure are transmitted through the tissues especially when I bear weight, and that it isn\'t a neurological problem. He stated that my case is very rare and did not suggest any concrete treatment or surgery yet (said he\'ll consult with some colleagues, still hasn\'t responded to my mail).\n\nOne of them said he saw oedemas in joints when looking at the MRI disc (which was not stated in the MRI report) and said I might have arthritis.\n\nRheumatologist discarded arthritis just by looking at the CRP level in blood, not looking at MRI disc or other things.\n\nNeurologist suspected potential nerve issues but said it\'s not evident if it\'s the main culprit or not.\n\n**Tried treatments and remedies:**\n\nMost of the treatments I did were generally based on that initial plantar fasciitis diagnosis. They included: various strength and stretching exercises, icing and heat, taping the heel pad so that its more cushioned, NSAIDs and anti-inflammatory supplements, epsom baths, special footwear, massage, tecar, laser, tens, ultrasound therapies.\n\nWith no apparent effect from those, they sent me to do shockwave therapy which made things 10 times worse - definitely the most painful month in my life.\n\nAfter that I got cortisone shot in the right heel fat pad which provided no relief but now I have an indentation like some tissue is missing at the site of the injection.\n\nLastly, I was given 3 PRP shots and only the third one provided a slight relief for about 3 weeks. First two were wasted as doc said I could freely take NSAIDs, blood mixing was around 3 min, it was fairly cheap (around 20 dollars per shot), etc. Only later did I find out from others that the real PRP treatment is not done like that.\n\nNeurologist gave me some alpha-lipoic acid and vitamin B12 supplements, currently taking those.\n\n**My thoughts and feelings:**\n\nThrough my own research, I thought it was the heel fat pad syndrome but I am not sure since some sources say that mentioned syndrome is actually the atrophy of the fatty tissue while others say that atrophy is only one of the possible causes. My right (worse) heel was not stated as atrophied and my left one only slightly. Also the pain is typically not contained only to the heel fat pad. Not a single doctor mentioned that diagnosis.\n\nThis thing completely turned my life upside down. I couldn\'t walk or do literally anything involving feet so I had to return to my hometown to live with my old sick parents. Traveling, dating, fitness, social life in general hit rock bottom. Most of my days are spent sitting and laying down in the same room looking at the same walls. Im finding it extremely hard to manage and endure pain all the time. No one has been able to help me so far and its only getting worse. I was a long time sufferer of depression and anxiety so this took an even bigger hit on my mental health. Hell, I even just quit antidepressants a few months before this happened. I dont know what to do, Ive been crying regularly and having suicidal thoughts.'"

T4 Medication of 125mg every morning for more than a decade. Stable.\n\n\nVery mild, barely noticeable purple small marks throughout the body\'s skin, not palpable, more like a bruise type but tiny. No itchiness for the most part except for few instances, very mild, scratching causes pink skin, disappears quickly. In certain parts such as my arms the color is pink. It is so faded and so minimal that a doctor would probably call me insane. The trunk is slightly more noticeable. You must be a hypochondriac to spot the difference but it\'s there. No doubt about it. Appeared on day three onwards.\n\nMild diarrhea along with clay stools and previously greenish stool water. Stool dimension is consistently lower than normal. No blood. Frequent stomach burp sounds. Has been present since day one.\n\nMild foam in urine. Remains after flushing. No doubt about it. No blood. No dark color. No particularly intense foul odor. Increasing my water intake and peeing more frequently reduces it. Appeared on day 7 onwards.\n\nMild discomfort on my liver and kidney area. So mild and infrequent that could easily be misplaced for anxiety. But it occurred. Same for my appendix. It may be for seconds during the day. Appeared on day 18 onwards.\n\nLow-grade fever, for 18 days. Never beyond 37.5 (axillary), never in the mornings, body temperature was simply higher always. Resulting in temperatures of 37.0 to 37.2 almost every afternoon and night. Mild fatigue. Mild sweating during sleep realizing only upon waking up. Fever began on April 9, ended without medication on April 27.\n\nNo swollen lymph nodes. No swollen tonsils. No sore throat. No cough. No hypertension. No jaundice. But, extreme stress from fear of having contracted HIV, especially the first weeks I had frequent panic attacks.\n\nPossible exposure on March 25. Blood drawn from vein tests done,\n- April 9, HIV-1 RNA <40 copies, negative.\n- April 13 HIV-1 RNA <40 copies, negative.\n- April 19 4th Gen Combo (p24 antigen, plus HIV-1/2 antibodies), negative 0.25 <1.0 s/co\n- April 19 Insti blood drop rapid antibody test, negative.\n- April 21 HIV-2 RNA <500 copies, negative.\n- April 26 4th Gen Combo (p24 antigen, plus HIV-1/2 antibodies), negative 0.27 <1.0 s/co\n\nAdditional info: I ate 25 walnuts every morning for 3 days prior to fever. I may have eaten a mildly suspicious chicken breast a day before. I had an occurrence where I inhaled and thought I caught a flu (it is a very distinct odor/feel). Almost two months ago I had a very rough case of pneumonia for a month, never found out if it was Covid, treated with inhaler, medicine and eventually prednisone, although I doubt they sped it up.\n\nThe symptoms scream for HIV. My tests so far indicate otherwise. I have scheduled appointments for blood and urine tests on Tuesday. I was so caught up with HIV tests that I ignored the rest. The only thing that has every single side-effect and is close is ""Henoch-Schonlein purpura"". It mentions phagocytes attacking the blood, which incidentally is what happens during the onset of an HIV infection... or an upper respiratory infection, or a hepatitis infection.\n\nWhat could it possibly be? I am not expecting a cure online but I am genuinely curious if anyone has been through something similar or has something in mind.'"

I had a DVT in my left arm after nurses at the nearby ER were rough with my iv and all sorts of complaints. I was prescribed Eliquis and was fine for the first 4 days.\n\nAfter the 4th day, I started to notice vomiting, weakness, dizziness, you name it since taking the Eliquis. I went in to the ER, they said it was nothing, gave me fluids, then sent me home. I then went in again because my symptoms were progressively getting worse. They took my off Eliquis and put me on Xarelto, which is when I started throwing up blood after my second dose of that.\n\nI\'m mostly writing this to see if it is possible to have symptoms like these, and I\'ll put a full list at the end of this post. I\'ve been dealing with ER after ER telling me it\'s ""in my head"" and or ""depression"" which I have neither. I was fairly healthy before taking the eliquis, working on my truck, working a blue collar job, running around, etc. Now I am confined to either my bed or my chair, needing help from my brother or parents to even get to the bathroom, and a whole bunch of other crap.\n\nNo ER has found any bleeding in the forms of a hemorrhage, stroke, mini-stroke, or anything of the like. I\'ve had 2 CT scans and about 6 MRI scans.\n\nI called the pharmacy at the best hospital here in Arizona, Mayo, and they did mention a bunch of side effects that their website also lists (along with you know, the infamous WebMD, [Drugs.com](https://Drugs.com), etc). Their website uses that big ol\' standard pharmacy system called MicroMedex and it would show up here but no doctor, (any of the at least 7 I have talked to, including hematologists, neurologists, internal medicine, or general hospitalities) will admit that it is the medicine I have experienced.\n\nI am still dealing with these issues, 3 weeks after taking my last dose and having the okay to stop it, and once again, would like to see if anyone can verify all, some, or just one of the effects I am having. I am not taking any medication at all, and as stated at the beginning of this post, have no medical issues like depression, ADHD, OCD, A-Fib, or anything of the sorts, physical or mental.\n\nEdit: The Eliquis was 4x 5mg a day for 7 days then 2x 5mg a day, and the Xarelto was 1x 20mg a day. Took Eliquis for 12 days, Xarelto 2 days.\n\nEdit 2: Doctors have ruled out any sort of meningitis and have done a massive amounts of blood and vital tests that come back normal every time.\n\nEdit 3: This has been brought up a couple times now on other subreddits, so I want to address it. My b-12 was actually a little high, however electrolytes were \'perfect\' and all vitals and blood tests came back healthy with no outlying concerns, highs, or lows.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13hd1ix/21f_possible_levothyroxine_drug_eruption_rashes/,b'21F possible Levothyroxine drug eruption rashes',"b'Age: 21 \n\nSex: F\n\nHeight: 53\n\nWeight: 115\n\nRace: Caucasian\n\nI work in dermatology (as a medical assistant; I am in my first year of medical school), and I have already had the physician I work with take a look. I have worked in dermatology for several years now, but I wanted to post on here to ask for a second opinion and another perspective.\n\nSome context: on May 2nd, I began treatment with generic Levothyroxine (dosage 25 mcg). I was recently diagnosed with Hashimotos thyroiditis by my endocrinologist. \n\nOn May 8th, I noticed a few small, tiny, raised rashes on my abdomen; no itching whatsoever. Each following day, I noticed more and more of these tiny little rashes. Today is May 14, and these rashes are now distributed all over my abdomen, back, chest, and neck. There are even a few directly above the groin area. I have never had rashes that look like this before, ever.\n\nMy first thought was cholinergic urticaria. I am tachycardic, and I also take Concerta for my ADHD (I have been on a stable dose of this medication for 3 years now), so I sweat easily with heat. (Before you ask, I have seen a cardiologist recently, and my EKG and echo are normal; I have trace mitral regurg, but that is the only slight abnormality). However, I have never had cholinergic urticaria before, and the rashes are more rash-like than hive-like, and they did not go away within 24 hours. At this point I sent myself hydrocortisone 2.5, and began applying it to the affected areas. \n\nThen, I had the thought that these rashes may be caused by bedbugs. I did a complete search of my bed, bedroom, and apartment, and found no sign of bedbugs (or any other bugs for that matter). Just to be safe, I did a deep clean and disinfection of my entire apartment, mattress, bedding, etc. Also, if the rashes were in fact bedbug bites, they would be extremely itchy (which they are not), and the rashes would have a tiny dark blood spot in the centre, which they do not.\n\nAnd then I realized that the sudden appearance of these mystery rashes all over my body may be related to my Levothyroxine (which is generic T4, not any brand name). The sudden appearance of the rashes coincided with when I started taking Levothyroxine, or more accurately when I had been taking it for about a week or so. \n\n(No, I have not had any contact with any pets, new household products, no new shampoos or soaps either, and we have ruled out ACD).\n\nI reached out to my endocrinologist as soon as I came to the realization that these rashes may be a drug eruption. He informed me that I may be having a reaction to the dyes, fillers, and additives in Levothyroxine, and he sent out a prescription for Tirosint that same day. Tirosint does not contain any of the dyes, fillers, or additives that Levothyroxine, Synthroid, etc contain, and it only has a few ingredients as opposed to many. I did some research, and I found that quite a few patients reported reactions and developed rashes as a side effect of Levothyroxine/Synthroid/other T4 medications containing such ingredients. These patients seemed to do better on Tirosint. My endocrinologist also suggested I see one of the dermatologists that I work with about the rash.\n\nI skipped my Levothyroxine dose for two days, and as of yesterday morning, I took my first dose of Tirosint 25 mcg (my insurance refused to cover it, so it took me some time to actually get the prescription).\n\nYesterday (May 13), I had a dermatologist at my practice take a look at the rashes on my body. She found more on my back that I wasnt aware of. She also did not know what the rashes were, and was extremely puzzled, but she did agree with me at the possibility that they may have been caused by a reaction to the generic Levothyroxine I had been taking. However, she isnt sure, and I have reached out to another dermatologist at my practice for her opinion as well.\n\nI have attached three photos of the rashes below. The first is of my abdomen, the second is of my neck (I have coloured over my collarbone tattoo for anonymity), and the third is of my chest (the two pimple-like bumps in the middle of the rashes are benign and I have had them since childhood). Every day I find more and more of these rashes on my body, and since they do not seem to be resolving, I am looking for another opinion as to what they are, what may be the cause of them, and how I should go about treating them. The sudden appearance of these rashes is extremely upsetting and stressful. Summer is here, and I cannot be dealing with mystery rashes all over my body right now; it is devastating.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/S2ObZ3H'"

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/yqr1iw/hi_either_i_m19_am_going_crazy_or_im_seeing_air/,"b""Hi, either I (M19) am going crazy or I'm seeing air currents.""","b'Uhh, i think I can see air currents. I only noticed this yesterday at work when I saw the air current of the air leaving the Computer i was using rising up. I found it interesting, but like, it\'s semi hot air, and the ambient is cold, so no surprise I could see the lines of the air distorting.\n\n\nThen I looked at the ground and tried to see it on normal temperature. It\'s a bit harder but i can do it. In bright places is harder still, like, I\'m not sure if i can do it in the sun. And it\'s way easier if i do it focusing on a object. Anything that emanates heat has air rising up around the hottest parts\n\n\nLet me be perfectly clear: It\'s not like a weird type of synesthesia, I can\'t see it all around everywhere. I need to focus my vision on the space between the  foreground and the background, in the air. And then I can kind of see some interference lines sometimes. They\'re very unstable, and don\'t sit still, i can\'t follow a line. They disappear very quickly. My guess is that what I can see is actually the air distorting ever so slightly the light in the background when theres a difference in pressure, caused by movement.\n\n\nI couldn\'t find anything on this when googling about it EXCEPT some people talking about seeing the energy of things, in very pseudoscientific communities. Some aspects of what they described seemed to line up with what I am seeing. Not when they talk about static or seeing balls of energy floating around, but in specific these patterns of lines moving. Being a science man, I\'m guessing they\'re assuming it\'s energy because electronics tend to produce heat, and as I\'ve said, hot air is a little bit easier to see.\n\n\nI can\'t stress this enough, it\'s not those floater things in the eye. \n\n\nNow some maybe relevant information: I\'ve researched about hallucinogenic perception disorder because it was mentioned in one of those communities (Which I guess makes sense for them. They probably do psychedelics and stuff). I don\'t think it applies to my situation because I am not seeing the characteristic static or the inverted displaced after image, and the floaters i have to look for to see them (and have been in my eye ever since I can remember, i honestly don\'t see how it is a symptom, since it is normal)  \n\n\nSince I mentioned drugs, i think I should mention this: I smoke weed and also eat cannabis edibles. I can\'t say I do it often, it\'s veeerry sparse. I think at times when I\'m smoking the most I smoke one joint per week. But it\'s been more than two weeks right now since I last did it. \n\n\nAnd there\'s also the medication. I have ADHD and yesterday (the day I realized it) I took some Venvanse 36 mg. I have the prescription for it, but i don\'t use it all of the time since it\'s expensive, it makes me have some minor involuntary tics, i don\'t want to create resistance to the drug, and I don\'t need it everyday. I spend a lot of time without using it, sometimes three weeks without, and sometime one a day for three days on a row if it is hard to concentrate and I\'m doing a specifically demanding job. Averaging it all, i guess we can say I use it once a week. Sometimes instead of Venvanse I use concerta, also 36 mg. I\'m providing this information because it may be, but honestly i don\'t think it is related. \n\n\nLastly, and the most ironic thing when I\'m claiming that ""i can see air movement"": I use glasses. 4 \'something\' on both eyes. I am near sighted. I have those characteristic light aberrations upwards with and without glasses, it\'s very minor, a dot (.) may look like a comma (,) on my cellphone if the contrast is bad enough, but it doesn\'t look like it enough that i mistake one for another, i just provided a visual description of what it is like. I can see this air effect both with glasses and without them. If I\'m without them I can see it easier but only on close objects.\n\n\nAlso and this may not be relevant but my eyes are grey/green, and I have fotofobia (light sensitivity)\n\n\nBy the way, i think I know a relevant person in history that could do the same thing, but it doesn\'t really help my case that i am a sane person and I\'m not hallucinating: Some of Van Gogh paintings from the time after his major psychosis crisis (the one in wich he cuts his ear lobe) [depicts mathematically perfect turbulent flow](https://medium.com/the-omnivore/how-did-van-goghs-turbulent-mind-depict-one-of-the-most-complex-concepts-in-physics-a10d0faacdbc) And apparently he was the first one to do that. \n\n\nPair this to the fact that the wind movement is also a turbulent flow, his paintings seem to describe wind movement coherently with the place they are (for example, in a lake it is more linear, around a object it is veeerry turbulent) and I came to the conclusion that maybe he really was focusing on air, and trying show that in his paintings. If my theory is correct there\'s also some collateral effects on his style that shows this: the stars being so blurry, may be because his eye wasn\'t focused on them when seeing air, and he chose to represent that instead of mixing true reality and air vision.\n\n\nThis was just a phase and reportedly he didn\'t like the results that much. He wrote that starry night was ""just a night study"" the term study also makes me think he was observing something and trying to replicate it (albeit in a more exaggerated manner)\n\n\nI\'ve been doing little tests throughout the last hour, trying to see which objects create these lines consistently the most (it\'s electronics) and if i can find the hot spots of it, because with this i can have some confirmation.\n\n\nI\'d say I\'m guessing correctly about 80% of the time. Sometimes my findings are even a little unexpected to me. Example: A laptop screen was emanating these lines in the same pattern as fire would show up if the whole screen were on fire. When I came close to it, the screen was indeed hot. It is probably heating the air around itself. It was counterintuitive because I had a laptop a while ago and the screen didn\'t heat up nearly as much as my colleague\'s one. So I was expecting to see the lines around the area of the mousepad, as it was where mine heated up. His doesn\'t, and I didn\'t see the lines there.\n\n\nAs stated before, I\'m a science man, and I know we can fool ourselves to create confirmation bias even if we don\'t realize. When I get home I plan on doing a blind test with candles behind something that blocks my view of them, so if i can guess where they are just identifying the rising air i can at least say I can see *hot* air currents. I\'ll have to think something else to confirm normal wind. \n\n\nMy question is: Optometrists, have you ever heard of something like this? Psychiatrists, is it possible that it is a hallucination that follows what my subconscious expects to see? Does anyone knows any medical record of patients describing this fenomenon?\n\n\nTLDR: I think I can see air if i focus really hard and I\'m tripping balls about it'"

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12s2kcg/68m_recurrent_right_sided_nosebleeds_resistant_to/,b'68M Recurrent right sided nosebleeds resistant to treatment followed by respiratory infection',"b'My  dad is a 68 year old Mexican (mestizo) male. At the time of his first  nosebleed, he was diagnosed with diabetes, high cholesterol, and  prehypertension. He\'s 5\'6"" and weights 180 pounds. He rarely drinks and  doesn\'t smoke or use recreational drugs. He\'s prescribed metformin,  insulin, aspirin, and lovastatin but refuses to use the last two. He  also has arthritis in his elbows, for which his doctor tells him to use  ibuprofen as needed. I don\'t know his cholesterol levels or A1C.\n\nAbout  two weeks ago now, had a nosebleed (limited to the right nostril) for  the first time in over 30 years while he was cleaning the garage. We  asked him if he accidentally hit himself, scratched his nose, or sneezed  but he insisted that it just started out of nowhere. Initially he was  able to stop the bleeding but later that same day the bleeding resumed  while he was moving some boxes (15-35lbs). We were unable to stop the  bleeding and he went to the emergency room where they tried to stop the  bleeding with Tranexamic acid and, after that failed, cocaine  hydrochloride  before ultimately applying an anterior nasal packing. His  blood pressure was checked and it was high 143/83 but the doctor said  it could be due to the stress of the situation and didn\'t warrant  immediate treatment (side info, he had a heart rate of 85, low 60s seems to be normal for him). He was told to go back in two days to remove it and  cauterize the affected area. He was also prescribed  cephalexin (I\'m assuming to prevent opportunistic infections). Apart  from the nosebleed, he seemed fine. He was a little shook from the  experience but was feeling good. No other symptoms.\n\nTwo  days later he went to get the nasal packing removed and the doctor  determined nothing needed to be cauterized. My dad was told to be  careful for a few days and to schedule an appointment with his PCP,  which he did. He has that appointment later today. Two days after  getting the nasal packing removed, he woke up with a bloody nose that he  was unable to stop. He went to the ER again where they ended up  cauterizing his nose. He had some minor discomfort from the procedure  but was fine otherwise. He was also referred to an ENT doctor and was  able to schedule an appointment, but it\'s a month from now.\n\nSince  then, he\'s experienced 1 more severe nosebleeding episode. He went to  the ER and got it treated with lidocaine and since his blood pressure  was higher 153/89, he was prescribed blood pressure medication  (something starting with an an L -- I don\'t have the documents on hand).  He was also given a nose clip and finally had some lab work done (cbc,  complete metabolic panel, and prothrombin time test -- those results  will probably be discussed today). He\'s since experienced two minor  nosebleeding episodes that have been effectively treated at home. In  addition, starting the day his nasal pack was removed he started  experiencing symptoms of what appears to be a respiratory infection.  This will be explained in the next paragraph.\n\nThe  day my dad got his nasal pack removed, he complained of discomfort in  the nose and sinuses. Some discomfort was to be expected but the day  after he started developing a sore throat which eventually progressed to  a dry cough, headache, coughing fits and nocturnal fever (no  thermometer available to record temperature). He went to urgent care  which prescribed him prednisone and azithromycin. It\'s been two days  since and there\'s been no change on his condition on that front. The  illness appears to be communicable since my mom started displaying  symptoms about 4 days after my dad. It\'s possible that he caught the bug  during Easter since we had a small gathering (<8 people) though no  one else was displaying symptoms at the time or has displayed symptoms  since. My dad has been tested for both covid and the flu, for which he  has tested negative. It\'s also possible he caught it while seeking  treatment for his nosebleed due to the area of treatment but I\'m  wondering if the two could be interrelated.\n\nIt\'s  concerning that after having no nosebleed or symptomatic medical issues  for so long (other than the diabetes), one would present so abruptly  and severely without any physical trauma or changes in medicine or  lifestyle habits. My questions would be what would be some of the most  likely causes of nosebleeds in someone with his medical history  (hypertension seems to be a big one)? His visit with the PCP is today.  What would be some good things to bring up or ask about in his upcoming  visit that his doctor might overlook but could be important?  \n\n\nUpdate: My dad continued to experience a few drops of blood from his nostril for about 3 weeks after the cauterization at the ER this but it never required going back into the doctor\'s office. His blood work was lost in the Great American Medical system but his GP didn\'t seem to concerned with finding it. He went to his ENT appointment and the doc checked everything out. He found no evidence of anything pathological and just gave him some general nose care advice. Pneumonia eventually resolved as well. He continues to deny that he picked or otherwise damaged his nose in the moments preceding his nosebleed. I guess uncontrollable nosebleeds just happen sometimes.'"

I never used to have this but since I DID have Covid (over Christmas) it's become common when I get poorly.\n\nI am almost better now (it's been 3 weeks since the illness started), and the only real lasting symptom is a snotty nose (clear snot and not even that much now) but also an incredibly overpowering taste in my mouth. It's a cross between nail varnish remover and TCP and it's horrendous. I can barely taste food over it and I'm still unable to smell much. \n\nI asked my wife if she could smell it on my breath and she confirmed that yes, she could smell a TCP like smell (and I had JUST cleaned my teeth). \n\nI don't think I have any notable other symptoms, but this is really affecting me. I can taste it from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep, but I think it's even affecting how easily I fall asleep as its so strong. Sometimes it feels like my mouth is stinging a bit, but I'm not sure if I'm just imagining it. \n\nI've tried contacting my GP surgery but I wasn't even able to get through today, so will try again tomorrow. \n\nI'm just worried about what this could possibly be. It doesn't seem to be lessening and it's stressing me out quite a lot. \n\nCan anyone offer any advice or remedies? Or suggestions I can tell my GP should I get through tomorrow?\n\nAny advice or ideas are welcome. Googling leads to concerning mentions of diabetes, but then I don't seem to have any other symptoms."""

So I finally took one dose of Zoloft 50mg about 18 hours ago and just had too many side effects, especially for right now with a work deadline next week and considering I just started three new medications for my heart and still adjusting to that. (Pretty sure it was the Zoloft because these new side effects all began not long after I took it.) The side effects were waking up hot and then shivering once walking around, high heart rate, more anxiety, more palpitations than the last few days, and nausea and dizziness. The nausea and dizziness were expected and didn't bother me as much as the others, as I'm not trying to put myself back in afib. Anyways, I'd like to possibly try again on the Zoloft later, at a lower dose, maybe some weeks or a month from now, or try another SSRI.

It doesn\'t happen on schedule but about every 4 days. I don\'t use drugs or drink with any frequency. I understand that I am obese, but I know what caused this weight gain; this post\'s issue existed when I was in a much healthier range.\n\nAfter yawning, or occasionally at random after taking a deep breath, I get shooting pains that last about 2 minutes. They stretch from my jaw to neck, to the muscles on the side of my ribcage, and often into the outside of my upper leg, always on the left side. This pain is incapacitating to the point I can\'t speak or stand up.\n\nIt has happened while I\'m in bed, sitting down, standing, walking, and running. It has happened at all times of the day. I\'ve tried relaxing the muscles that are clenching as I do for cramps, but they just keep tensing, nothing stops the pain except for waiting 1-2 minutes, and it still lingers for hours.\n\nI\'ve adjusted my working posture, sleeping position, tried rest, ice, and warm packs, but it still happens basically without warning. Since yawns are the most common trigger, I\'ve tried both fully relaxing myself when I yawn AND suppressing yawns, but it hasn\'t had an effect on the frequency.\n\nAny ideas?

Drink/smoke maybe once a month, no recreational drugs. Ride a bicycle about 8-12km a week most weeks.\n\nI\'ve had GERD since at least middle school but found treatment here in South Korea where I manage it fairly well.  For years, mostly before menopause, treatment included daily Nexium.  Due to bone density loss the doctor has switched over to KCAB, which is tegoprazan as far as I know. \n\nWhen the bone density loss was discovered, I was treated with injected Fosomax (I think, four injections over the course of a year).  Side effects there included a weird taste on injection day and muscle cramps when I wasn\'t eating right.  Supplements of vitamin D and minerals got that under control and reduced my coffee habit.  This was just over two years ago.\n\nForward to today. Occasional muscle cramps still happen, but the current episode is bad to the point of scary, resembling an anxiety attack with whole body tension including diaphragm. I\'d had a fall off a stool about a year ago and worried I\'d injured my spine, the symptoms were that dramatic. Right now I\'m on muscle relaxants and something to increase stomach mucous, in addition to tegoprazan (2 years) and mosapride (5+ years, once a day as needed). \n\nBeing in Korea means I can see doctors readily but have difficulty communicating with them. Tegoprazan is a ""potassium-competitive acid blocker"" but they can\'t explain that to me in layman\'s terms. What does that mean in terms of mineral absorption and deficiencies? How do I counteract that without overdosing on something that will do more harm than good?\n\nI fell off that stool about a year ago and have a tingling in my tongue and chin off and on since then, but with no apparent cause. Either I hit my tailbone a lot harder than I think, or my anxiety is worse than I think, or I have some mineral deficiency? Physical therapy and muscle relaxants help but I don\'t want to fry my liver. Benzos cause dependency so I don\'t want to go there.  I had Covid in December and rested for a week with lots of medications, but one of its memorable symptoms was diaphragm tension and the resulting shortness of breath, treated with an opiate-based cough syrup. \n\nI have several \'silent\' gallstones, have had them for years. Menopause is past and largely without symptoms. This thing, whatever it is, includes muscle tension, bloating, hot flashes in just my arms WTF, digestive irregularity, and tension that settles in the neck, shoulders, and lower left back. My posture was truly terrible a few months ago and I\'ve been working on correcting that, so I\'ve had muscle discomfort for weeks but it\'s gotten worse.\n\ntl;dr Is tegoprazan related to all-over body muscle spasms?

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/slctp0/what_else_can_this_be/,b'What ELSE can this be?',"b'Male. 57, 6\'-0"" 200lbs. I\'ve started piling up some concerning symptoms that, to me, seems to keep checking boxes towards a dreaded pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Of course I\'m just guessing and all the doctors keep saying, ""you don\'t have pancreatic cancer"", but it feels like they keep saying it because the odds are so low. Given my symptoms (below), what ELSE can this be? FWIW, I\'m still seeing several docs and lots more tests are happening. Here\'s the symptom chronology (this is long, but I wanted to be complete-- thanks to anyone that takes the time to read it:\n\n**December, 2019**. My cardiologist -- who I\'m seeing for PVCs and put me on 100mg of Metoprolol, which eliminates them -- asks me if anyone has pointed out my disturbing creatinine numbers. I\'ve been in and out of the ER over the last year three times for kidney stones and abdominal pain and always told, ""your kidney\'s look fine"". No doc has said anything. I look at the data with him and we notice creatinine going up steadily since 2015 and at this period it\'s at 1.80. My eGFR is at 40. Again, several trips to the ER since 2015 and every time the docs said, ""your kidneys look fine"" when clearly they steadily progressed to this point. Sadly, it\'s the last time I take any response from a doc at face value.\n\n**February 2020**. I\'m finally in to see my nephrologist and he says my HBP meds aren\'t doing enough (BP average at this time is 150/88) and keeps me on Losartan, but also adds Epleronone twice daily. I have a lifetime history of chronically low potassium so the Epleronone is potassium sparing and it works. My BP is now steady around 120/70. He says little to me other than how to watch my diet, but we read in his notes later that he diagnosed me as having CKD stage 3A. When I ask him about this at the next appointment he says my protein number (7) is so low that now that my BP is under control he expects the progression to be so slow that I\'ll be long gone before my kidneys are a problem. Today I\'m holding with creatinine bouncing between 1.5 and 1.89 and an eGFR between a low of 30 and high of 50. In his notes to my primary he mentions that he doesn\'t understand why I have CKD and says I shouldn\'t have it. That\'s concerning. I also dropped salt out of my diet quite some time ago, but now also move to low sodium for everything where possible and begin looking at sodium on every label.\n\n**May 2020**, I go see my primary to complain about what I call a ""squirrel"" in my lower left abdomen (about belly button height) that feels about the size of a fist and will often move from left to right, but basically lives on the left side. He sends me to a gastro and I get another colonoscopy and an endoscope (and later a sigmoidoscopy). No issues other than some mild diverticulosis.  He believes it\'s IBS. I drop all gluten and all dairy. The squirrel lives on to this day. He rules out SIBO, pancreatitis and colitis. The gastro also orders an MRI of the pelvis, abdomin and pancreas area with and without contrast (with the approval of my nephro due to the gadolinium. Apparently they\'re using some new kind of it which they claim doesn\'t harm the kidneys). All come back normal.\n\n**February 2021**. I go see my primary to complain about a full-body itch. It tends to start in my hands/palms, which then begin to feel as if they\'re under a lot of pressure and bloating, but look fine, and then the itch spreads everywhere, especially my scalp and ALL orifices. Benedryl does nothing. Zyrtec might do a tiny bit, but it\'s hard to tell as the itch seems to ebb and flow like the tides. Doc sends me for more bloodwork thinking it\'s the kidneys getting much worse. The full battery comes up with nothing. He puts me on gabapentin. It seems to dull the itch, but again, it feels anecdoctal to me. The itch continues to this day and is with me most of the day/night. The ONLY rash I ever got from it consisted of the night before I saw the doc when I found red dots on my forehead and what looked like poison ivy on my right eyelid. I feel like it was due to my scratching so much that night in my sleep. NO other signs of rash show up again. I should mention that I\'m always sensitive to things and use sensitive skin soaps, detergent, etc. Tags on shirts drive me insane so I cut them all off. That sort of thing. I also have a family history of VERY dry skin. My heels crack badly every winter (I now try to use Amlactin which helps).\n\n**March 2021**. I end up in the ER again with severe abdominal pain. An ultrasound shows my gall bladder is done. I\'m admitted and it\'s removed. At this point I have brown circles around my eyeballs and my skin is yellowed. Two docs tell me my liver is shot the ALT and AST are something like 350 and 500. One even suggests I need a new liver immediately. Two other docs say it\'s due to just having carved my gall bladder out and that the liver numbers will return to normal. Flash-forward and that\'s what happens. Liver has some fattiness, but all numbers look fine now. I hoped this is the cause of the itch but it wasn\'t, and the abdominal pain continues. It now is often coupled with my abdomen being distended. I\'ve always had bouts of diarrhea my entire life and actually was told I had Celiac disease. However, at age 7 the docs put me on a regular diet as a test and I seemed to respond well until about 14 when I notice I get diarrhea when I eat too much pasta or dairy. I moderate for decades until my May, 2020 IBS diagnosis when I again cut out gluten/dairy. The diarrhea continues and just worsens to the point where it even seems a salad can go badly. Normal stool becomes very sporadic with little clues to help. Celiac is proven to have been a bad diagnosis with some newer blood test for it. A Mass General expert on celiac tells me he believes I have severe IBS, but that my eating gluten and dairy wouldn\'t have caused cancer as it would in a Celiac paitent.\n\n**April 2021**. My dermatologist removes a couple moles (biopsy is fine) and rules out any skin cancer. Believes my itch is due to the CKD.\n\n**May 2021**. I see an immunologist who tells me they only ever find the cause of pruitus about 20% of the time and it may be an allergic reaction to drugs. I take Allopurinal (family history of gout -- I haven\'t had an attack in 20 years), Metroprolol, Losartan and Epleronone. One by one we take me off each drug for 6 weeks except for the Losartan and each time the itch remains.\n\n**June 2021**. I notice something bizarre. I\'m now getting what\'s called retrograde ejaculations. Nothing comes out 90% of the time. Primary is baffled and sends me to a urologist but no openings until November. Is this related? No idea. Perhaps prostate problems.\n\n**November, 2021**. I\'m having some dental challenges (lots of damage from when I played serious hockey from age 4 to 23) and have an implant put in, plus a couple root canals. Doc puts me on amoxicillin and, much to my surprise, the itch either takes a short vacation or goes away from the drug. I go about a week with zero itch (prior to this it only maybe took a day off here and there). I alert my primary who says it\'s coincidental, but puts me on a steroid and another antibiotic and it seems to also dull the itch, but it\'s still there so the results are inconclusive. During a later dental surgery I\'m back on amoxicillin and it doesn\'t do much. MAYBE it went down 20%. Maybe that\'s a mirage. I did have an infection in the wisdom tooth tissue, but that clears up immediately.\n\n**November 2021**. I see a new immunologist from Penn and she sends me for another battery of tests. All come back negative.\n\n**November 2021**. Urologist does a full checkup and rules out my prostate, which she says is fine. Thinks I have scarring from an earlier hockey injury that\'s now gotten worse and is the cause of the retrograde issues. Still looking into this.\n\n**November 2021**. I get a second nephro opinion from the Penn doc I saw back in 2013 before my kidney\'s went south. She looks over everything and sends me for genetic testing looking for two specific markers. We still haven\'t gotten that test back. I forget what she was looking for. Something very specific and she warns me to pay no attention to the rest of the test results which she claims are likely to scare me. She and my main nephro both rule out the kidneys as the cause of my itch saying my numbers are way too low for it to be neurological kidney itch.\n\n**November 2021**. Primary sends me for a full imaging battery again. I get another round of MRI\'s with and without contrast, again with the nephro signing off. All ""normal"". They do see cysts on my kidneys, but don\'t see any blood flow to them. One they mark as a cyst to keep an eye on. They tell me this is normal for my age.\n\n**December 2021**. I notice my feet are now purple when I wake up and they sometimes turn purple during the day. Blood pooling I assume. I fill in my primary. My blood sugar is always borderline staying pretty much at 120 for the last 20+ years. If I drop out ALL treats I can get the number to 99, but that\'s it, and it\'s a miserable existence.\n\n**December 2021**. I switch to another gastro and he seems quite intent on getting to the bottom of the issue. He sends me for another battery of tests and begins looking for ""zebras"" saying we\'ve essentially ruled out all the common issues. All tests come back fine. I see him again in mid-February.\n\n**January 2022.** The immunologist does more testing and also suspects my thyroid might be swollen so we get an ultrasound for that. To me the right one feels a bit strange, but it turns out the left one has two nodes that the report claims have a blood supply, but don\'t appear to be a problem. I don\'t get that. Blood supply says tumor to me. Here\'s the entire report:\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------\n\nUltrasound of the thyroid and parathyroid regions were obtained using grayscale images with color Doppler flow.The right thyroid lobe measures 5 x 1.6 x 1.8 cm .The left thyroid lobe measures 5 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm.The isthmus has a thickness found at 8 mm.\n\nHomogeneous thyroid parenchyma is seen bilaterally associated with normal color Doppler flow.\n\nLeft lobe:Nodule one: Lobular superficial minimally exophytic heterogeneous predominantly isoechoic nodule measuring 6 x 5 x 6 mm with internal color Doppler flow and with posterior shadowing possibly secondary to adjacent internal calcification.\n\nNormal-appearing nodes are seen bilaterally.\n\nThere is no adenopathy within the visualized portion of the soft tissue neck.\n\nIMPRESSION:Left-sided 6 mm TR 4 nodule\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------\n\nI notice in the report they don\'t really mention the second node, but it appears on the diagram they draw. It\'s directly below the first and much smaller. It too has blood flow. They recommend just monitoring it by waiting 12 months. My primary thinks we need to get this checked out given all the other symptoms. I see the immunologist who ordered it shortly.\n\n**January 2022**. Now I\'m checking off naseau on the concerning symptoms list. For last 6 days I\'m suddenly getting bouts of naseau, but not enough to actually vomit. It comes and goes. This is really worrying me now. Unexplained weight loss is the last line. So far that hasn\'t happened.\n\n**February 2022**. On the 1st I notice a major pain in my back (I have a bad back from hockey/sports and have had a ACDF-cervical disc fusion and have lumbar bulging) but this doesn\'t feel at all like the spine. It\'s about 3"" to the left of the spine and just behind the bottom of my left shoulder blade. It feels like I\'ve been shot by a spear gun. Now laying flat is uncomfortable or reclining in a chair. It burns as well and at times my entire left side from the shoulder blade down to around my side to the ""squirrel"" spot feels like its burning. My primary (via televisit) still thinks it\'s not pancreas as all recent imaging and blood tests show no issues. He thinks this leads to auto-immune issues. FYI, my son has severe dysautonomia, specifically Sjogrens on top of literally 100 symptoms. When thinking about it I recall that for several months I\'ve felt a TINY discomfort in this area and just thought it was a slight muscle pull. In the last couple weeks I recall feeling that sitting back in a chair would irritate my back right at the left shoulder blade, but never a bad pain until now.\n\n**February 2022**. I now find my hands feel like they weight 50 pounds each. It\'s hard to sit at a desk and type for any length. I need to set them down to rest. I\'m fatigued. I realize I\'m now repeatedly waking up to find I just slept for 11-14 hours and I\'m even napping during the day. Any activity is wiping me out. Sometimes I get a shaky feeling from it. I also notice that when I take a deep breath I get a VERY slight tingly feeling on my left side where the back pain is. It doesn\'t impact my breathing overall and today that\'s not happening at all.\n\n**February 2022**. On the 3rd a new symptom materializes. Due to my CKD I\'m doing all I can to drink about 80 ounces of water a day, helped once a day by a citrate powder (as recommended by my nephro who pointed out my citrates were low), but now I can\'t seem to quench my thirst and my mouth has virtually no saliva. My tongue is getting stuck inside my mouth. This now has been there all day, every day since. Diabetes? Doc says no, unless I\'m the healthiest diabetic ever given my other numbers.\n\n**February 2022**. Primary sends me for another battery of blood tests to once again look at my kidneys, pancreas function and the other standard blood tests. He\'s still thinking no cancer, but auto-immune issues. In desperation I also spend $949 to get a Galleri (pronounced Gallery) blood work-up that is a recent test to look for DNA markers for 50 cancers that are generally not part of the bloodwork tests. I won\'t hear back for up to a month on this and the odds are slim. I may have wasted a grand, but it\'ll make me sleep better. An answer has to be somewhere.\n\nLastly, FWIW, I realize that a small part of the time I\'ve purposely taken to staying asleep longer than normal because most of the symptoms aren\'t there when I wake up. SOMETIMES, but rarely, the itch is there, but the abdominal pain isn\'t there. The back pain is there, but generally it\'s almost not noticeable depending on how I\'m laying. I find I\'m often talking to myself subconsciously saying, ""I\'m still in a deep sleep"" in some fruitless effort to keep my abdomin from starting its daily attack. Once I begin moving during the day it all goes on the offensive.\n\nIf you got this far, again, thank you! I\'m in desperation mode now. Thoughts begin to hit like not making my next birthday, summer, Christmas, etc. I almost feel like finding a terrible cause is better than finding no cause. At least we\'d have a target. Of course that\'s wrong, but the powerless feeling is just so hard to shake.'"

I survived childhood sexual abuse (about a decade before it tapered off) and would like to know if its possible to have contracted an infection from it.  \n\nDetails that may be pertinent:\n- biological dad had an issue with frequently hooking up with women in the sex trade.  Biological mother got STIs; to my knowledge she received no medical attention due to distrust of the medical system and her own mental illness.  She was my perpetrator not my biological dad. \n- Frequent UTIs as a kid\n- I had regular prenatal care during my pregnancies, as well as routine lab panels for STIs and group B strep.  All normal.  Apart from cold sores when sick everything appears normal. \n- As a young child (7), was hospitalized for a few days (?) for an extensive bumpy rash that started at my neck and spread down all over my chest and upper torso.  I remember being feverish, and sores inside my mouth and lips.  I was out of school for a few weeks.  The story that was always maintained was that it was an allergic reaction to drug byproduct I breathed in while sitting in a parked car.  I have trouble believing this story now, since I dont remember the reaction at all...just waking up really sick one morning before school.  My bio parents have difficulty telling the truth and my bio mother was suspected to have munchausens by proxy as well so arent credible.  I have requested medical records from the facility but havent heard back yet and not sure if theres anything there. \n\nI am most concerned about learning my bio mother went untreated, and whatever happened at 7.  The story sounds really sketchy to me now.  Are all STIs captured by blood test or could there be stuff that got missed?  \n\nIf anyone is able to advise that would be most appreciated.  It is beginning to cause me a great deal of anxiety.'"

So far we haven't needed it.\n\nShe very strictly avoids both shellfish and coconut, and I very rarely have either of those in the house.\n\nLast night, she had an allergic reaction while eating leftovers (salmon, mashed potatoes, and broccoli). When she had the food the first time when in the restaurant, she had no problem, but last night she had a reaction. This has happened other times, sometimes with food prepared within the home, sometimes when out and about.\n\nI realize that cross-contamination is a possibility for triggering the reactions, but in some cases I just don't see how it could be that. One time she had a reaction when eating a banana, but she has had bananas many times before and after that incident, so I really don't think that cross-contamination is the cause in all cases.\n\nI also realize she could be developing a new allergy, but so far there is no consistency to the foods she is eating that is triggering this, which of course makes it challenging to figure out if this is the case.\n\nDoes anyone have other thoughts on what might be confusing her body into thinking she's eating something she's allergic to? Any thoughts on what I could look up or ask her doctor to check for?\n\nThanks all!"""

I dont know whats the cause or how to fix it.',"b'I have 8 ear piercings and wear glasses. I went through metal allergic reactions before but only because I used poor quality jewellery on fresh piercings. The allergy only affected the new piercings (yes, I did this a few times) and the flair up immediately stopped after replacing the jewellery with gold. I never had issues with using poor quality jewellery in fully healed holes. At worst it got a little itchy when I didnt wear jewellery in a long time.\n\n\nBut the current situation is so much worse and affects even the healthy skin.\n\n\nIt started about 2 weeks ago. My stretched lobes got unusually crusty. A clear liquid kept on pouring from them so they returned to being crusty immediately after each cleanup. I didnt think much about it because my stretched lobes have a history of being cranky.\n\n\nThen I got a strange wound on my nose. It was a red, sore and slightly swollen spot that also kept pouring liquid. It made me look like I was crying.\n\n\nI thought I contained something, like a fungal infection, from a customer because Im a cashier. But then I replaced one of my tunnels and glasses with plastic alternatives and the issue disappeared.\n\n\nMy other ear is still crusty and swollen because I cant unscrew the jewellery. Ill have to get it professionally removed.\n\n\nBut the story doesnt end there. My previously unaffected piercings also became acting out.\n\n\nAt this point I doubt whether metal is actually the main cause of the problem. Maybe theres something wrong with my immune system and the allergic reaction is just a symptom. I know skin reacts with metal but seriously, glasses?!\n\n\nIm a 21yo woman with ADHD, OCD and asthma. I take concentra, Zoloft and various inhalers with steroids. The steroids affect my joints so I wouldnt be surprised if they also affected other parts of my body. I am allergic to things like dust, feathers, pollen, bed bugs and more but still live with my feathered and dusty birds (Im fine as long as I dont smell them). Two weeks ago when the issue appeared I was at my dads, his house is located in a tiny village and isnt being maintained on a regular basis so every allergy trigger that affects me thrives there.\n\n\nOh and outside of the metal thing my lugs arent doing too well either.'"

He woke up in the morning (6am) and went to the bathroom. While going to the bathroom he noticed he was very itchy and could hardly talk because his lips were so swollen. We panicked and I got him some Benadryl. He got in the shower just trying to get relief from the hives and itching where he fainted. He hadnt eaten since the night before around 11:30pm (he had a granola bar and some jerkyboth things he had eaten before, same brand and everything). Before that, dinner was chili around 7pm and he just drank water this night. The only thing new to his diet here was kidney beans which he says he hasnt had since he was a kid. He is a HARD sleeper and really cant be woken easily at all so we thought maybe the reaction started overnight. Side note, he uses a CPAP for sleep apnea. After this incident, he got 2 EpiPens and had allergy testing ordered.\n\nMarch comes and he finally has his allergy testing where they tested for around 48 different allergensall unremarkable.

We dont remember what dinner was but he had some wine during lecture.\n\nToday, we had Taco Bell breakfast, which weve never had before and then went out to a brewery where he had some beers and we had some pizza as well. All things hes had before, and the beers were the same ones he had last weekend at this same brewery. On the drive home, his stomach started hurting horribly and he suddenly needed to go to the bathroom. We made it home before the hives, trouble breathing and cold spells started. He took some Benadryl and everything went away but now hes super tired, freezing cold and having stomach pains.\n\nIm very worried about him and were not getting anywhere with doctors.

I am posting from a throwaway but I have been a longtime lurker of this sub and find it to be so helpful. I am posting about my sibling and if that is not okay please discard; however I called 911 for her last night. \n\nMy 35yo female sibling, no known drug allergies, diagnosis of anosmia >1.5 years, diagnosed with bronchitis about one month ago, symptoms have cleared. She takes one SSRI for depression (Lexapro) and other than that no medications other than an Albuterol inhaler that was prescribed as needed for Bronchitis over a month ago. \n\nWe are on the phone last night for about one hour. My sister had gone out to have dinner and had two alcoholic beverages. Everything was fine and nothing strange or notable happened to her during the meal. While we were on the phone she arrived back to her apartment and had two boxes that had been shipped to her sitting outside the door. \n\nShe opened both boxes with me on the phone. One of them was a handmade plate and the other was a large box of dresses. She was trying on clothing from a subscription service in which you receive ten dresses, choose one, send unwanted dresses back, pay this company dollars. She is texting me as the dresses are being tried on with photos of each one while we are still talking and I hear the phone drop. \n\nI could hear some shuffling noises and then a terrible noise that sounded like a deep honk, the only way I can explain it is that it sounded like a guttural gasp or goose honk. I was yelling her name and then could not hear any movement, nothing. To get to the point (sorry, I can be wordy) I disconnected and then called her back several times. I actually thought someone had broken in, she passed out, etc. \n\nFour minutes elapsed and I finally connected with her, she sounded very sleepy, and a bit confused. She told me that she was unsure what just happened but that her throat had completely closed up and to the best of her ability, she understood she was having an allergic reaction and could not get air in- she was able to tell me that she had been gasping for air and I assume that is what the noise I could hear was. \n\nI called 911; she lives about 30 minutes from me in the county (a rural area) and stayed on the phone with her until they arrived. We spoke with dispatch on a conference call and she took four puffs of her Albuterol inhaler (prescribed one month ago for bronchitis) and one zyrtec (she had no benadryl). \n\nI stayed on the line throughout this experience in which EMS arrived and assisted her, O2 SAT was 100 which they stated was good and likely because she had taken four puffs of her inhaler prior to their arrival. Her pulse was ""normal"" at 98 and BP they stated was a bit elevated. I want to say it was 120/100 but I might be wrong.\n\nNeedless to say, the EMS told my sister that she had experienced an allergic reaction, to the best of their knowledge, was not showing signs and symptoms that she needed hospitalization. I asked her to ask them what could have caused this. She actually brought the dress out that she had tried on and one of the EMS team members stated that they could smell a very strong chemical smell on the dress ""that might have been used to sanitize"". I heard him stated there is no way to identify exactly what this smell was but that it was familiar to him. Another EMS team member then stated he actually has asthma and began to wheeze after taking a sniff of the dress!\n\nNow after reading all of this I want to thank you for making it this far and ask- what do you think this could have been? I will let you know that we are both in the counseling field and planners so she called her primary care doctor this morning to make an appointment and she has also requested to be referred to an allergist. This ordeal was really scary and has us both shaken up. I do not want to say she experienced anaphylactic shock but I know her throat constricted and this happened so suddenly! I want to receive any advice you have. I have tried to include every single detail but will be happy to answer any question. THANK YOU! \n\n(if you are wondering my ""normal"" reddit username is so obviously me and I do not want to identify my sister or her medical diagnoses/history- therefore the post from a throwaway account.'"

Starting to fear for my mental health at this point.',"b'Hi all - apologies in advance for this novel. \n\nA week ago on Monday, I had what I thought was an allergic reaction. My skin began to itch, mostly in my arms, however, there were no hives. About an hour prior to my reaction, I did smoke a little bit of Delta-8, so I tried my best to stay calm and I took a bendaryl. The itching turned to straight burning. Anywhere my skin came in contact with something, it would feel like a sunburn - though there was no redness or hives anywhere. Panicking, I took another bendaryl and a zyrtec, which did little to nothing. This sensation has been coming and going for the last week since the initial reaction. There is no outward signs of a reaction, save for my skin occasionally turning a little red. It gets particularly bad when I\'m driving and have to use my hands on the wheel.\n\nI went to urgent care the day after the reaction when the itching and burning did not let up, was prescribed steroids, and have been on 60mg of Prednisone for 5 days now. They took blood, and my bloodwork came back looking relatively normal, but was flagged for a low RBC, low MCHC, high Lymph, and high Eos count. My ANA was normal. I also wanted to note that when I went to the initial urgent care appointment, and they asked for me to take my shirt off to check for rashes, my skin exhibited ""mottling"", as the PA put it. Once I warmed back up, however, that went away. They suggested I make an appointment with a dermatologist, and while I have done that, I also made an appointment with an allergist. I am doing my best to not fall down a panic-induced google hole with this.\n\nI take Lexapro 10mg and a zyrtec daily, and benadryl as needed. I have allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, coffee (true tragedy here), tea, two types of antibiotics, cats, and dogs. In the last two years, I developed four of those allergies (the two antibiotics and the coffee and tea.) There is a cat in the house and a dog in the house, but I have NEVER reacted like this before, or at least nothing beyond a sniffly nose and itchy eyes when I\'m with the cat. I do carry an epi-pen for my peanut allergy, but I\'ve never needed to use it. I have no pre-existing health conditions besides these allergies and my anxiety and work in an active career, so I\'m in decent shape. I have maybe three alcoholic drinks a week. I am not pregnant.\n\nSince the initial reaction, I have not smoked, nor was I exposed to anything outside of my usual diet or skincare routine during the day of my reaction. I have also smoked from that pen multiple times before, with no negative side effects whatsoever. I went from not smoking at all for about a year to smoking it every other night or so for about three weeks leading up to this, and only out of this delta-8 pen, which I haven\'t touched since the initial reaction. I did go through a very stressful personal life event four days prior to the reaction, and given that there are no outward symptoms, part of me is wondering if it\'s just stress. I made a list of everything I ate/interacted with since the reaction.\n\nTL;DR: my skin is on-and-off burning everywhere it touches stuff. Bloodwork pointed to an allergic reaction, despite me not ingesting a known allergen. There is no outward signs of this. I\'ve been on steroids to treat this and honestly I\'m not sure if they\'re even working. It\'s like my skin has been ultra-sensitive. This has been going on for five days and I\'m a little afraid it will get worse and I will go into anaphylaxis and die (anxiety!!! we love her!!!)\n\nI\'m frightened, and with a week until my allergist appointment I\'m worried the situation will just  get worse. Any input would be very appreciated - am I doing everything I can be? What else is there to do?'"

It was pretty painful (a sharp pinching feeling), however there was no blood and the wound is barely noticeable (theres a very, very small darkish dot where it happened). \n\nI was going to go and get a tetanus shot at the pharmacy, however, I had remembered that when I was younger (among my first vaccine shots) I had a very serious reaction (in the ICU with breathing issues and, if Im remembering correctly, seizures as well) to one of (or more) the vaccines, never finding out what exactly caused it. This history has me quite nervous about getting the Tdap vaccine, however Im also a bit nervous about the small injury. At the moment, Im kind of torn on whether or not I should get it. Ive had a lot of little injuries like this over the past few years, and obviously Ive been fine, but I guess Id just like to hear someone elses opinion regarding the risk assessment.\n\nIf this information helps, the piece of metal was indoors and had been rinsed with water earlier in the day.\n\nAny help is appreciated, thanks in advance : )'"

It was slow, but it started fast. I haven't had a ton of exposure to cats since early 2020, which was a time I had semi-frequent prolonged exposure to my partner's cats (with the help of Allegra and Reactine), who now live across the country with his mother. I still reacted pretty immediate, and the reaction was burning eyes, sore throat, some fatigue, itchiness... common stuff. it didn't seem to be any better or less when I saw them, which was only about once a month or so, but for a few days at a time (he lived an hour away at the time).\n\n\nSince lockdown hit, I've only really had two major exposures to a cat. The first one was last year (I can't remember at all when, but it was in 2022 sometime), and I took a lot longer to start reacting, but the reaction was far worse - by the time I left apartment with the cat, which was about an hour and a half after I got there, I felt a migraine coming on as I walked to the bus stop, and I could barely stand up by the time I got home 15 minutes later, and in addition to my usual reactions I was also dizzy and nauseated. \n\nToday I just had another exposure to cat. It was about 3.5 hours. It was a house -- so bigger and airy-er than the apartment from the last reaction -- with two cats, and both cats avoided me anyway, so I thought I would be okay if I took a bit of extra Reactine beforehand (I take some every day). I only got a bit of a sore throat and a bit fatigued by 3 hours in, and then on the car ride home I was hit with much more throat pain, fatigue, nausea, some confusion and dizziness, and when I got into my apartment I felt a headache start, and as I was about to shower I started feel really itchy. \n\n\nI'm now in bed, post-shower, and I'm still very itchy and fatigued. My throat feels tight but no longer sore. I took an Allegra-D and it brought things down to a tolerable level and have also just taken a Tylenol Ultra for the headache. \n\nIs it possible that my allergy is getting worse, even if it doesn't kick in until I leave the area with the cat? Is it all in my head? Can a reaction be that delayed?\n\nTL;DR lately my reaction to cats has kicked in the hardest after leaving the cat and it is confusing me"""

Even then histamine and control looked the same as the prick for the pill. They then ordered a blood test and it was inconclusive but my IgE was high (I can\'t find the results at the moment).\n\nBefore the food challenge my new-to-me Allergist decided that with my medical history and plethora of food and environmental allergens, that they should recheck the skin test that their now-retired cohort said was inconclusive but with the peanut butter and not the pill.\n\nThe histamine scratch was noticably raised and the control was barely reactive and the peanut butter scratch was somewhere in between. The allergist checked and didn\'t give me any difinitive answer at that time as to how we would proceed but before the nurses could process my file more I coughed a few times and the nurses got suspicious and started milling around waiting to see what would happen.\n\nI started couging so hard I had to take my feet off the floor to brace my abs and tried to take my inhaler but I was unable to inhale enough volume to make use of it so they rushed to set up the nebulizer.

Of course thats a fking allergic reaction!"" and I bring it back to the allergist who feels confidently correct about their assessment I will once again be met with a shrug and being dismissed again.\n\nI was also told that I am NOT a good candidate for food challenges and if its ever needed I will need to do it at a place with an ER like Emory or Grady here in Atlanta.\n\nMy questions are : \n\nWas this an allergic reaction? \n\nIf no- what does it resemble? \n\nIs there any point in going to an ENT for this?'"

With some research, I discovered that fungus is also a major cause of dandruff, and that I could've unknowingly transmitted it to other areas of my body. I went to an urgent care facility over this issue and they gave me a ketoconazole shampoo prescription. After my first shower with this shampoo, I started doing repairs on a newly-acquired record player. About two hours in, I noticed that I had a slowly creeping brain fog. This was about an hour ago. At this point the brain fog is overwhelming, and I am having trouble with basic tasks.  \n\n\nThe brain fog is also not mentioned as a side-effect of the ketoconazole shampoo, however with some basic Google searches I found that it is a common symptom of fungal die-off.

We were sitting in a house with the door open (my friends live by a river). I noticed I got bit and left it alone. Before we left, I felt a bug bite on my leg too, but then got distracted and forgot about it.\n When I went to bed that night (this past Sunday), I woke up to my arms being SO itchy, as well as my legs, and I realized that I had been bit 7 times. \n Its not abnormal for me to get eaten alive by bugs. Over the past year Ive started to realize just how sensitive I am to mosquitos specifically, but who isnt?   \n I think this next part is relevant to note though: this past summer I got bit 6 times in less than 5 minutes and quickly broke out in huge hives where the bites were at. That was the most intense reaction Ive ever had to a bug bite. \n\n Now since this past Sunday and the 7 initial spots, Ive had a few more bumps form. One on my chest, one on each shoulder, and a bunch on my lower back. Ive been so itchy all over, feeling like new bumps are forming, and the original bites dont seem to be looking better. They seem enlarged even though I havent itched them, the area around them are swollen and red, and some of the bumps look white. \n Even though they dont look like hives I feel like they are. My husband and my friends didnt get bit by anything. I did laundry yesterday thinking maybe I had something on my bedding and clothing, yet I still had new bumps pop up today.\n\nSo my questions:\n- Whether or not theyre hives, if they keep popping up should I see a doctor?\n- Since I do take prescribed adderall, if I wanted to take an antihistamine would there be a drug interaction? There is so much conflicting information about this online. \n- Could I be having a breakout from anything else? Nothing else seems new to me. Only thing I do that is bad for my allergies is eat dairy and wheat all the time, but Ive never broken out in hives from that...\n- Last question and I feel so stupid asking this, but could it possibly be chicken pox even though I had those when I was three? The only images I find that resemble the spots I have are images of chicken pox. I feel like theres no way it could be that though.  \n\nI know I probably seem ridiculous for this lengthy post, but I just dont want to have to see a doctor if I can help it, and Ive never had a reaction like this.

Sorry if info is incomplete; Im willing to answer any necessary questions. I (22F) am a college student, and I occasionally go back to my hometown to visit my parents. When I visit, I stay with them, as I/we do not have the money to put me in a hotel (and there are very few decent ones nearby). My parents had 2 dogs, one of whom had puppies a couple of months ago. Puppies peeing on the floor was expected, but our house is old and has hardwood flooring, and I dont know if theyve rehydrated something or if Im allergic to dog pee residue or what. I have documented asthma and allergies (prick test; not very responsive to dogs, compared to cats, which I am VERY allergic to). As prescribed by my allergist, every morning I take 2 Benadryl (25 mg/cap), 1 Zyrtec (10 mg/cap), and my daily inhaler (Proair maybe? I cant remember the name or dosage off the top of my head, but its red and I take 2 puffs); at night, I take 1 Singulair (10 mg/cap) (yes, Im always exhausted). I have an albuterol inhaler and an epinephrine inhaler for emergencies, but I hardly have to use either of those. I use the albuterol inhaler if Im ever going to be around cats, or if Im doing very heavy exercise, and Im usually fine. None of these things seem to work when I walk into my parents house, though. I start wheezing, the skin around my neck sometimes itches, my eyes itch just a bit, and I just generally cant breathe. Im here right now, and it got so bad last night that I stacked all my pillows to sit up against, STILL couldnt breathe well (but could sleep), and woke up every hour or so due to coughing or discomfort. I just dont know what to do at this point. Im taking my stuff as directed, and my parents house is extremely clean (mom is a bit neurotic about cleaning). This didnt happen until the puppies happened, and now it happens every single time I come home, and doesnt really fully go away when I go back to my college town. Ive never experienced the obvious anaphylaxis, and I genuinely dont know if an acute version of that is what I could be experiencing. I dont know what Im experiencing, how to treat it, or what to tell my parents. Please help. Thank yall so much in advance :)'"

Due to TRT and exercise I have a high hemoglobin/hematocrit and have been donating blood regularly to offset this.\n\nThe morning of the blood drive,  I had a ~45 minute run and then a large breakfast of steak, eggs, and butter around 6am.  I also had an electrolyte drink with 1200mg sodium and 600mg potassium.\n\nUpon showing up at the blood drive, which was at noon, my hemoglobin was tested with an instant-read device at 17.8 which is about what I expected it to be.  \n\nI typically squeeze the ball pretty aggressively when donating blood.  I was not familiar with the double red procedure and wasn\'t able to tell when the return vs draw was happening.  This was an at-the-workplace blood drive and didn\'t have constant supervision.\n\nAt some point during the procedure the needle infiltrated and I ended up with a bulge on my arm about 0.5"" high and maybe 2""x3"" in width/height.  The nurse showed some concern when she pulled the needle but said it would go down.  I thought nothing of it and went on my merry way.  I did not eat/drink anything caloric.\n\nWhen I got back to my desk (just upstairs), I started itching.  Probably 10 minutes after finishing the procedure.  All over my body but most noticably on both of my shoulders (the blood draw was at the usual location, inside the elbow) and my head.  I noticed hives on my shoulders.\n\nI went back downstairs and told them about it, they had me talk to a doc via phone and fill out a report.  I wasn\'t especially concerned, moreso just wanted answers in-case there\'s something I need to know about for future care.  This was the first time the nurses had seen any kind of reaction like this that wasn\'t local to the injection site.\n\nThe doc did not seem willing to speculate on what could have caused it but advised me to leave work, take two benedryl, and if I had trouble breathing, to use my son\'s epi-pen (when explaining, I mentioned that my son had a nut allergy so I had a bit of experience with allergic reactions) and call 911.    I think she is supposed to call back today for follow-up.\n\nI went home (~40 minute drive) and felt completely fine by the time I got home.  Still I took the benadryl as advised, zonked out, and am totally fine today.  Had a bad run this morning, but that\'s to be expected with the red blood cell loss.\n\nWhat I can\'t understand is what I could have possibly had an allergy to.  They return your own blood + saline into you, and I can\'t imagine having an allergy to saline -- seems like that would not be compatible with life.  I\'ve also had IV drips before of saline, glucose, and medication.  \n\nThe nurse mentioned that an anticoagulent agent might be part of it, but didn\'t know what it was.  I think it would just be citrate? Which again seems like something unlikely to be allergic to?  I\'ve taken tons of medications and supplements in my life that are bound to citrate, and I\'d assume I\'ve probably had it intravenously at some point, having been on a few IV drips in my life.\n\nHeparin might be used but it seems rare, and heparin allergies are also very rare?\n\nIt wouldn\'t have anything like warfarin in it, would it?  I can\'t imagine that.\n\nI think it was definitely something in the return, because it wasn\'t localized to the injection site.  I\'m also not allergic to latex. \n\n**Could there be a common component of CT scan dye and apheresis return solution?

She was also prescribed a second taper of steroids (60mg first two days, 40mg next two, 20mg next two, 10mg last two).\n\nOn Sunday evening **(2-5-2023)** I (30M, 185lbs) noticed the sides of my nose were getting red. Every month or so I tend to get a brief bout of seborrheic dermatitis on either side of my nose (exacerbated by stress, usually worse in winter months), so I assumed it was that. It got worse Monday **(2-6-2023)** but that seems to be the way it usually progresses. Tuesday evening **(2-7-2023)** I noticed the redness had become raised blotches and the rest of my face was looking a little blotchy too, as well as some redness on my upper chest. I didn't take any Benadryl as I am prescribed Xywav (3g currently, twice nightly, first started 1-19-2023) for sleep, and they are adamant about not taking another CNS depressant concurrently. \n\nThis morning **(2-8-2023)** I woke up, and the blotchiness was even worse. The effects are still local to my face and upper chest. I visited my works on-site clinic today and they gave me a steroid shot and prescribed me a course of oral steroids (I apologize, I didn't catch the name of either), recommended I take Zyrtec once a day, and referred me to an allergist. I have never been allergic to anything before, except for a once-in-a-blue-moon reaction to a certain variety of hops, which caused upper body hives and a flushed face, which has happened maybe 3 times in my life to my knowledge. Side note, I have been waking up covered in sweat the past 3 nights.\n\nInterestingly, her two cats have had issues since they all moved into my house last November. They have been pulling some of their fur out, which we initially thought might have been a stress induced reaction. We check them for fleas regularly and have never seen any, and they're regularly treated for fleas as well.\n\nWe have tried to brainstorm possibilities for causing the reactions, but can't determine what it could possibly be.\n\n\n* ***Haven't changed laundry detergent***\n* ***Haven't changed diet***\n* ***Girlfriend recently got new eucalyptus soap (which her mom is allergic to) but she stopped using it a week ago, and I've never had a reaction to eucalyptus before***\n* ***No new pets***\n* ***No new cleaning products***\n* ***We've inspected for bed bugs and have never found anything, nor experienced any bug bites. Bedding has been washed twice since this started.***\n* ***HVAC filters changed on Sunday (2-5-2023)***\n\nWhile we first assumed it was related to my partners Thyroid condition, it seems now like it is environmental since I'm affected too. I suppose there's the possibility that we have different reactants, but the timing would be extraordinary. Any suggestions? It definitely appears to be worse usually at night or in the mornings, which leads me to think it's related to the bedding, but we haven't introduced anything new and we've inspected for bed bugs. \n\nAny ideas to what could possibly be going on to cause two adults who've never had a multi-day allergic reaction to suddenly break out in hives despite no apparent changes to house or lifestyle?"""

I\'m lucky I have IVIG and knew that back pain was an issue though it was hard for them to miss when I felt a sharp stabbing pain in my chest followed by what felt like my kidneys about to explode with pain radiating all the way down my back. It was worse than any SPS spasm I have ever had in my life...and for anyone who knows about SPS you can maybe imagine what I mean by that. I know they did everything they could to help me and for that, I am grateful. I have a feeling my SPS made the reaction worse somehow as I was so rigid it was like  I was nearly paralyzed...\n\nI\'ve done a lot of digging into venofer and in the ER I was seen by two doctors. The first I requested to be switched out because I knew him as someone who made up a diagnosis and lied in notes that was ruled in my favor on an internal review and treated me as a walk in and asked me questions that he had access to from the paperwork from the oncology center that I was not conscious for or conscious but unable to respond. Thinking I only was given benadryl after (I was given it before) and steroids (because that\'s the only word I remembered), he gave me two pepcid that immediately made my stomach hurt. (He also lied on his notes again...surprise)\n\nWhile Doctor two didn\'t lie and caused physical injury (he forced my stiff arm straight despite me telling him to not do that to an SPS patient and that he was hurting me)... I was deemed okay to go home, but I still didn\'t feel well. My stomach hurt a lot and still hurts even though it\'s four days since the allergic reaction. It hurts all the time and I guess may be radiating to my back or the back pain is on its own--it\'s located where the original onset came from.\n\nI know it\'s not the SPS because it\'s too high up and not my usual SPS spasms which are very well controlled with my medicines for it. But the nurse yelled at the other nurse to force me to sign the discharge papers and I\'ve been really sick ever since I\'ve left...\n\nEverything I can find on Venofer is that the side effects should wear off after a day or two. But I can\'t walk without feeling like doubling over in pain from my stomach and eating makes it worse. I can\'t got back to that ER. The only other in network ERs are an hour away. I am not sure if this is normal for the side effects to last this long but I know there\'s something wrong with how much pain I\'ve been in and the pepcid did make it worse or at least alerted me to something wrong with my stomach.\n\nI just can\'t find anything on Venofer that would cause this but it all started after the acute allergic reaction, I know the pepcid was the first sign that something was off with my stomach and when I said it was hurting my stomach no one believed me... just ""it shouldn\'t do that."" I\'m not sure what to do at this point because I can\'t find anything about Venofer and reactions like the one I had.'"

No other current medical issues.\n\n1) My mom's side of the family and my brother all have sensitive skin. I've always thought my skin was slightly less sensitive. My mom and brother both have eczema. I normally use completely unscented detergent and have never tried anything else. I've been traveling for a couple of weeks and needed to do laundry. The store I stopped at only had scented detergent in small bottles so I bought that. I probably wore clothes washed with this detergent 3 times before noticing major rashes.\n\n\n2) I'm also a MSM. Hadn't had sex for ~ 4 months until this Saturday. Just received non-reciprocated oral sex. Didn't notice any lesions on the person I had sex with. They left their underwear on so not sure if there was any underneath. Have not been able to get back in contact with this person.\n\nIssue:\n\nYesterday morning I woke up feeling very itchy. I noticed a large rash on my upper right leg and right butt cheek (not on my genitals). Thought it might have been bedbugs, so left the place I was staying at and washed everything again with the same detergent. As the day progressed my rashes grew. They are almost all in big patches. Nothing that looks like a pimple. Took some Benadryl which helped and spent the night in. Slept with just my shirt on and nothing below the waist. When I woke up my chest and back were noticeably worse, but everywhere else was about the same as the day before. This is when I realized it may be the detergent. All of my rashes are below the neck and above the knees, and the only part of my forearms that has a rash is the part that rests against my clothing. I have only been wearing a t-shirt and shorts for the past few weeks. I wear briefs which could potentially explain the worse rashes on the top part of my leg.\n\nMy question is based on the pattern of these rashes, what is the more likely cause here?

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/rfqjbx/suddenly_having_allergic_reactions_to_a_variety/,b'Suddenly having allergic reactions to a variety of foods at random? Afraid to eat.',"b'Hi docs.  I\'ve(28F) had a myriad of health issues pop up in the last two years.  Vestibular migraines the first year, and interstitial cystitis this year.  Wild to be healthy with no prior symptoms and then suddenly one day get two lifelong ailments, but my doctors just say I\'m unlucky and we\'ll never know why.\n\nAfter meeting with a natural doctor, I stopped eating gluten and dairy to reduce inflammation (which actually cut down on the daily dizziness), and then when I was diagnosed with IC, I cut out all acids, spicy foods, fermented foods and anything that could irritate the bladder further.  Unfortunately, mixed with a very stressful and emotionally neglectful year, this caused me to fall back into some eating disorder symptoms.  Basically I didn\'t eat very much for 4-5 months with the exception of potatoes and probably one or two complete meals per week when served by others or at a restaurant.\n\nThen about 2 months ago, when the stressful season was coming to a close, I realized I couldn\'t walk up the stairs anymore without getting lightheaded, and I realized it was time to start taking care of myself again.  Over the two months, I\'ve slowly reintroduced food back into my body.  Started with a lot of microwaved rice and eggs, and pieces of fish, now onto more complete meals like soups and cooked vegetables.  Once I started to reintroduce more fiber, I definitely started to have some gastrointestinal distress, which is to be expected. If I ate too big of meals, I would get lightheaded and sleepy about 30 minutes later(fell asleep at work several times).  Sometimes too big a meal who bring on a migraine.  So i\'m eating small meals more often now to keep my blood sugar constant.\n\nBut NOW I\'m having some weird symptoms.  I seem to be having allergic reactions to foods I\'ve never had an issue with before.  I\'ve been allergic to tree nuts since I was a child, which results in itchy mouth, mega stomach ache to the point of vomiting, flushing, and anaphylaxis, so I\'m very familiar with the symptoms of allergic reaction.  In the past, I\'ve had little moments of eating something random and getting a slight itchy mouth feel, but I always assumed it was in my head.  But now, I\'m getting full on allergic reactions to foods I\'ve eaten regularly.  Last week, I made some homemade mayo(out of just egg, garlic, and avocado oil, no acid cuz IC).  It seemed to be fine for the first  two days I ate it, but then one night I came home and had sweet potato fries with the mayo(something that\'s been a regular food for me even in recovery) and almost immediately I got itchy in my mouth, all over my body and flushed in the face.  After being totally shocked and a little panicky, I chugged a bunch of water, which seemed to help slightly, and then took a benedryl before bed.\n\nLast night, I pulled out some cucumbers tossed in soy sauce, garlic, and sesame that was also a leftover that I didn\'t have problems with the first day I ate it, and after eating a couple, same thing! Itchy mouth, itchy all over my body, and this time, I started getting that pit-in-my-stomach stomach ache.  Again, chugged a bunch of water, and took a benedryl before bed, but it was actually so bad that I kept waking up in the middle of the night because my skin felt hot and raw.\n\nThis morning, still had some residual itchiness and rawness.  Drank a smoothie made of ingredients I\'ve had very regularly for smoothies since recovery (frozen blueberries, kale, sunflower seed butter, pea protein powder) and wouldn\'t you know it,  by the end of the smoothie I was itchy!!! I\'m still itchy as I\'m typing this!\n\nMy first suspect is a sudden allergy to tyramine, because I know that can be present in leftovers, but almost super weird because before I stopped eating 6 months ago, I was the leftovers queen.  I love meal prepping and eating the same thing for 4 or 5 days.  Before the IC diagnosis,  I was a huge lover of fermented foods.  Brewed my own kombucha, ate sauerkraut and kimchi with meals often, obsessed with nato even, and never with any problem whatsoever. And the smoothie I ate this morning wasn\'t full of any tyramine-high foods, so what the fuck.\n\nSo now I\'m in a state of either the migraines or the IC flaring up (or both, on special days), and suddenly allergic to everything I\'m eating.  Other than feeling like I\'m going \\*fucking crazy\\*, I\'m kind of scared to eat anything.  I have an allergy panel booked, but they couldn\'t get me in until January, so it\'s going to be a while.\n\nMy question is essentially: What is happening to my body? Am I falling apart? Should I be doing anything differently? I don\'t mean to sound like a hypochondriac, but I\'m just so desperately trying to get back to some level of ""normal"" and it seems like it\'s only getting worse. Please let me know if you have any additional questions, and thank you so much for reading this long long post.\n\nEDIT: Since drafting this post up about 2 weeks ago, I\'ve continued to have experiences like this.  Had a reaction to a prepackaged bar (spirulina, sesame seeds, pumpkins seeds, etc) which made me doubt my previous theory about tyramine, and then I generally just feel like there are bugs crawling under my skin every day and kind of a tickly, burny feeling in my stomach.  When the tickly feeling gets really bad I\'ll take a benedryl, which kind of helps the next day but not completely.  I have an appointment to get allergy testing but not until middle of January.'"

Going to be as thorough as I can!\n\nBack in **October of 2021**, I (then 27F) noticed I had a few itchy spots around my feet and ankles as I was leaving work one day (retail). My feet and ankles had been covered up at work. I had been visiting my family in the suburbs a few days prior. When I got home I could \\*not\\* stop itching them, and over the next couple of days, they swelled up, got hard and very tender, and incredibly itchy and painful not just where the bites were but the areas surrounding. I have always had a very high pain tolerance, but I was brought to tears and couldn't sleep from the pain for days.\n\nI figured through my research that I had overitched some mosquito bites and developed cellulitis. I rested it and iced my feet for a few days and ultimately they got better. I took a couple of photos back then, and have attached them at the beginning of the IMGUR link below.\n\nThen **last month**, August 2022, I went to bed one night with no signs of any bites/hives, and woke up in the middle of the night feeling really itchy. I went to the bathroom mirror and counted about 20 different 'bites' on my arms (inner and outer biceps mainly). I remembered what had happened last time and restrained myself enough to NOT itch them, in hopes they didn't get worse. But they did, and once again became painfully, constantly itchy, swollen and hard. I experienced chills, very mild nausea, but no fever.\n\nThis time, too, I developed solid rashes on both my arms (my arms also became very tingly and numb) on the first day. Those went away by about halfway through the second day. On the second day I noticed a small what looked like mosquito bite on my ankle - through about one day of observation, it started throbbing, blanched, and eventually became a large blister (that I eventually drained on day 3 or 4 as it became very uncomfortable). The rest of my 'bites' didn't blister - they stayed red and itchy and ultimately reduced in volume.\n\nI went to a walk-in dermatologist and he told me he thought it was poison ivy. He gave me a cream to put on it and Certrizine to take orally three times a day, which did eventually help reduce symptoms. A doctor friend of mine wasn't sold on ivy/oak from the pictures I sent her - she's not a dermatologist but was sure they were bites.\n\nEverything was resolved until **yesterday evening** I started feeling an itch on my back. I had a bit of discomfort while sleeping, and when I checked in the mirror this morning there it was, one big welty bite that is hard, swollen, and very very itchy. Once again have mild chills.\n\nI can find no correlation between the three different times this has happened, and I'm not sure why there would be ten months in between instance 1 (October 2021) and instance 2 (August 2022). Nothing in common besides being at my same apartment - no new products, no new medicines. I've looked into the following:\n\n*Bed bugs* \\- confirmed from several different inspectors that my partner and I do not have bed bugs at our apartment, confirmed from doctor that these are not indicative of bed bug bites nor common reactions.\n\n*Skeeter syndrome -* this seems likely just based on the photographs I've seen of it online, but in August there was absolutely no sign of anything on my arms before going to sleep, and I feel I would have felt 20+ some mosquitos biting me in my bed. I've been getting mosquito bites all my life with no such adverse reactions (including just this past summer, where I've seen them bite me and then had the general annoyance that comes with bites without them becoming enflamed and painful like these ones).\n\n*Spider bites* \\- from what I can tell, most spider bites don't have reactions like this. Is it possible I'm allergic to a specific kind of spider bite (that doesn't affect most people)? Because it also doesn't look like they are from a black widow or brown recluse spider.\n\nI do intend to go to a dermatologist to check them out again, but it's going to be several days before I can do so, and it's making me really nervous that I don't know what is causing this. When there are several of them, as there were in August, it's debilitatingly painful enough that I'm not able to work.\n\nI've attached the photos that I took along with descriptions...any insight is much appreciated.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/nX2WFph](https://imgur.com/a/nX2WFph)"""

About 3 weeks ago I started having very random allergic reactions. It started when I was woken up at 4AM because of how itchy I was. Ive had allergic reactions before, and usually hives accompany the iching, but this time there were no hives. I was unable to sleep all night because I was iching so badly, so I took a shower just in case I had something on my skin, and the iching continued. My Boyfriend convinced me to go to urgent care and they told me they didnt know why and gave me an antihistamine. I was embarrassed because I felt like I was wasting their time. Since then almost every day I have a reaction, most commonly its Severe iching occasionally accompanied by hives, but 4 times now my lips have randomly swollen up and gone numb. This happens at random times and from what I have gathered has no commonality with what Im eating or when. I do have a history of being allergic to Tree nuts and Milk, but my recent lab results told me I am no longer allergic to either. I have been consuming very little dairy products since, but not tree nuts because it still scares me. \n\nAbout 1 week ago I noticed a big increase in fatigue and depression (I do have major depressive disorder) but I associated it with the start of my period. I ended up developing very bad brain fog, my thoughts are processing slower, I cannot think of words, and I will commonly forget what someone had just said to me (on the worst day I stopped at 3 green lights). I have been super fatigue and cannot get myself out of bed even if Im extremely thirsty and need water. Along with that Ive been extremely thirsty constantly and wake up around 2-3 times a night because I need water. I feel like my body is moving so much slower than normal and I feel as though I have no control over it. My depression has been very bad, Ive been urinating a lot more, and have been having bowel movements about 5-15 times a day depending on the day. Ive been having headaches as well.

I\'m being treated for treatment resistant MDD, and have a psych referral pending with a local psychiatrist.  Anyways, I\'ve been feeling pretty crappy the last two weeks, and have a noticeable tremor in my hands now. This past week, I\'ve had a racing heart rate intermittently, felt like I was having a panic attack sort of, and a general lightheadedness. Today, I was feeling pretty decent up until a few hours ago. I got up off the couch and started to feel dizzy, but ignored it.\n \nI have a history of low blood pressure and positional vertigo. For the vertigo, I was prescribed zofram prn. Sadly, I can\'t remember where I put it, I think my bottle is at work so I\'m SOL tonight. My vertigo spells are rare but violent. The room spins around me, I struggle to speak, twitch pretty intensely, and sometimes puke. They aren\'t fun, and last for hours. I can\'t sleep, can\'t do anything besides sit there and cry and try not to vomit. \n \nSo, as I\'m making dinner in my kitchen, I start to feel lightheaded and...wrong. A few minutes later, I start to feel like I\'m going to faint so I sit down. It passes, but I still feel wrong. I manage to finish cooking, eat my food on the floor of my living room, and try to lay down. Then the vertigo hits full force. I\'m twitching, nauseous, and want to cry. I lay down, and the spinning/puking goes away until I try to stand up. Suddenly, I feel incredibly hot, the room is spinning, my head is in pain, and I feel like I\'m going to actively puke. So I lay back down. \nAfter a few, I sit back up, experience that whole meds again, and crawl slowly to my bedroom and into bed where I\'m typing this from. \n\nI live alone, with only my sister nearby. She has a newborn, and I really don\'t want to disturb her. She is the only one with a key to my apartment. If I call anyone else, I\'d have to somehow get to my front door and open it, and getting to my bed was hell enough. With my history and my symptoms, should I just wait this out? Or do you all think I need to go to Instacare or the ER? I don\'t think there\'s much they can do for me. Can\'t really afford to call an ambulance, so I\'d rather not do that. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated. I don\'t think this is serotonin syndrome, as I\'ve been on these meds for two weeks.'"

However, I completely forgot about the patch test and didn't think to look behind and see how it was, so I thought it was fine. It was also my third lash lift, I did react slightly following the previous one 2 years ago but again put it down to a one off as I was fine before and the only problems I had was bloodshot eyes. \n\nThis time, my eyes were burning the whole time and I told her but she said it was normal and not to panic. Afterwards, my eyes were absolutely streaming with tears and again she said it was common but I was a bit concerned as that hadn't happened the previous 2 times. My eyes continued to get more and more red over the day and at 11pm I called the urgent advice line. They told me to go to the Emergency Department and get it checked out. Unfortunately the doctor I saw didn't understand what a lash lift was, and I wasn't entirely sure of all the ingredients so couldn't even be specific with him other than I know there's ammonia in them. \n\nHe gave me some pills to take for allergies and told me to continue using eye drops.

I always go to a salon, but the last time I did dye my hair myself was back around the same time I had the last lash lift in March 2020. I bought a black box dye because the salon was closed due to covid and the next day my eyes were bloodshot and painful for a couple of days and I got sores on the sides of my head. After that I decided id not buy box dyes again even if I was desperate, so then I didn't dye my hair for 2 years and let it go natural. \n\nIn February this year, I felt like it was time for a change, so I went to the salon and got my hair bleached and went a copper colour. I've maintained that with visits to the salon with no issues. On Tuesday I'm booked in but this time I want to go red red rather than orange red. I'm just very afraid now since reacting so badly to the eyelash tint (I assume it's the tint I'm allergic too, I think it contains PPD as does black dye in larger doses?). \n\nMy eyes continue to get more swollen and itchy, he prescribed chlorphenamine maleate (4mg) but so far I haven't noticed that it's helped. \n\nIs it a bad idea to go to the salon Tuesday for my hair appointment?

We didn't have any antihistamines so I told him to just not try and itch it and take some the next day. \n\nUnfortunately, he never ended up taking any, and while things seem to be getting a bit better in that it's not as raised anymore, it's still red and has been itching pretty bad the last few days he said. When he itches it, it obviously becomes more red and it becomes more raised again. Also, the right side seems to be much/nearly better, but the left is still giving issues. The left side was a lot worse to begin with too though. \n\nI told him that if it's not gone in the next few days, he needs to call a dermatologist, but I figured I'd post on here in the meantime and get some opinions. \n\nWe're not sure what it could be from. The only new thing was that he did wear a new suit the night it showed up, but his boxers should've been covering that skin anyways, and he didn't have this irritation anywhere else on his body. He doesn't have any preexisting skin issues, at least none that we're aware of lol. \n\nHere's some pics:\nFriday, 11/25:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/XGLtQwO\n\nYesterday, 11/30:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/gXfx3Hm\n\nThanks so much!"""

A nurse was able to lay me out which helped, but each time I sat up, my blood pressure dropped quickly and throat began to close up. I was given Benadryl via Epipen after about 45 minutes and an ambulance was called. Spent the evening in the hospital where the doctor told me to not receive a second dose.\n\nAt the time, COVID was trending down and given my age and health, I decided to totally forego any additional vaccine, however as things have worsened and Ive seen more people my age seriously afflicted, I want to get fully vaccinated. Ive heard J&J is a possibility. Is that true? I want to be certain I wont have a similar reaction. Still paying off medical bills for trying to do the right thing and get vaccinated early on.

My main symptoms of that are itchy eyes, rhinitis and chronic fatigue).\n\n  \nI tried a new face product a week ago and it felt like I had a \'funny tongue\' whilst I had it on. It felt like a bad taste, soapy and numbing, but I didn\'t get any product in my mouth as far as I knew. \n\n  \nAfter a couple of instances of that (I tried it twice more, had it on my face for about 5 minutes each time before washing it off) I figured out what product it was and decided to try it without any other products and really pay attention. \n\n  \n**Third application, my throat got quite tight (didn\'t feel like asthma, though), my tongue was actually swollen and scalloped, my eyes started to itch and my nose started running.

No skin symptoms, though, afaik.**\n\n  \nI googled my symptoms and figured out I was shit out of luck with any home remedies unless I wanted to turn up to the hospital with mild allergic symptoms, so I just took some ventolin and my ketotifen and hoped for the best since it hadn\'t escalated beyond the aforementioned symptoms. \n\n  \n**I\'m mostly good now, I put the bottle away into a ziplock ASAP, but for the last five days my throat is still a bit tight (it feels weirdly narrow), my tongue still a bit swollen (mild scalloping), and I\'m tired as hell.**\n\n  \nI coincidentally saw my doctor a few hours after that third reaction and I told him about the symptoms, but he just noted them down (and the product I tried) and told me to stop using it. \n\n  \nI see an immunologist once a year anyway for MCAS maintenance, but the allergy clinic can\'t help me test to find out what made this happen because they only do food and environmental testing. I got scratch tested there, and the only thing that came up was a mild dust mite allergy. I have to get a referral to another clinic. \n\n  \n**Basically, will this chill out eventually?

The symptoms vary, sometimes there are multiple combined, other times it'll be one symptom but the main ones I experience are swelling of the lips and eyes (one eye at a time), hives and my throat closing +coughing and wheezing.  My whole life I've had severe food allergies (resulting in anaphylaxis) so the first time my top lip and left eye swole I assumed it was something I'd come into contact with (despite being at home and not having eaten anything) so I took some Benadryl. However, it happened again about a month later and once again, I hadn't eaten or drank anything, it was completely random. This time though I wasn't at home so I couldn't pinpoint any correlating factors. Since then the reactions have increased in frequency (and severity, I began experiencing  chest/throat closing ) and there's no common denominator I can identify, it happens at random regardless of whether I've eaten or not, the time of day, where I am etc. The most prominent symptoms are the facial swelling, my top lip usually ends up inflating to twice its original size. Sometimes the swelling will be on the left or the right side, as is the case with my eyes. At times both my lips and eyes will swell simultaneously but as mentioned before, sometimes it'll just be an eye or my lips but a majority of the time it will be my lips. The hives are usually around either my hairline and scalp, neck, or Chest. I'm unsure whether I've developed a new allergy to something random environmentally or whether it may be some condition in which I just have them. In any event, I already have an appointment scheduled but figured I'd ask incase anyone has a guess or had any advice. I'm actually having a reaction as I write this, so apologies for any grammatical errors lol. Thank you for reading this!"""

Shortly after turning 20, I developed an allergy to soybean oil and certain soy products out of the blue. I have had 5 allergic reactions, 3 more minor (just severe hives and itching), and 2 more severe (throat closing, low blood pressure, insane hives so bad i cant think and cant help but to itch).

I kept waking up through out the night having these weird hot tingly sensation itches on random parts of my body and face.

So the next day I wake up and  I notice my face is more red than usual, I have a lot of acne so I thought thats what it was but then as the day went on i noticed it was more of a red blotchy kind of thing that i knew was more of a rash. I've been dealing with it all week and sometimes it gets itchy but its mainly just red. The thing is tho, is that it's not very noticeable unless you really look at it, or obviously when it flares up. Also when  I had covid I noticed the back of my head was so itchy.\n\nFast forward to today. I woke up early this morning and had to use the bathroom because whatever i ate last night didnt agree with me. As I was sitting there I felt that hot sensation then all hell broke loose. I was itchy everywhere, the area around my neck, face, and head was so itchy and red but it wasn't hives just red. It was mainly upper body but sort of on my legs as well but not nearly as bad and I started coughing so much, but i've had a slight cough/mucus since I got covid. I popped a benadryl and it went away in 30 mins. I don't what could have caused the flare up, I did drink last night so maybe thats what?\n\nI have had something sorta similar happen about a year and a half ago. I took a nap on a hot summer day in my room that has terrible ventilation so it was extremely stuffy and hot and i slept with all my clothes on.

Early Thursday morning I had a severe allergic reaction that woke me up.  I woke up at 3am with stomach cramps and nausea - I vomited multiple times over a couple of hours before falling asleep at 5:30am.  At 6:30 I woke up itching like crazy and got up to find my legs and arms covered in hives.  Both ears were puffy, red, and swollen.  I could barely hear out of my left ear.  I went to to urgent care and was told it was likely an anaphylactic allergic reaction and was given Benadryl and a steroid shot.  This took away my hives and helped my ears a little bit (though one is still slightly puffy).  I was prescribed an epipen and went home.  Its been two days and Ive developed chest congestion since my allergic reaction.  Tight chest and coughing - but no tight throat trouble breathing. \n\nThis whole situation really freaked me out and I feel unsafe and anxious about everything. Is this chest congestion a normal thing after allergic reaction? Is it related?  Or is it separate?  Maybe seasonal allergies or a cold?  I know very little about allergic reactions and cant find anything about what to expect afterward.  \n\nIm 32F, 57, 175lb, I dont drink, smoke, or so drugs - I take 200mg of Wellbutrin, and .50mg of Levothyroxine daily.

Also deviated septum, with the right nostril being narrower. \n* Crackling/pressure in right ear - started around June 2022, at first intermittent, now daily\n* Intermittent limb pain and twitching - initially only in the left thigh, now affecting all limbs. 1-3 days of an aching/inflamed feeling in the muscle, twitching with or without pain. My knees also sometimes turn red, usually the left one, with or without pain. Being close to heat e.g. fireplace or hot bath makes my knees stiff and sore. \n* Burst blood vessels with pain - happened about 5-6 times with the pain, a small single spot (purpura?) or petechiae\n* Spider veins in thighs and inner elbows, varicose vein on inner right knee that hurts when standing for long periods\n\nTimeline (all within the past month):\n\n* Went to GP about starting itraconazole instead for toenail infection, and was assured this would also clear up any other fungal infections I thought I had e.g. oral, vaginal, scalp. Had swollen lymph node, salivary gland and ears checked. Prescribed nasal spray, 5 days of prednisone, and continue to take antihistamines. Referred for neck ultrasound. \n* Developed covid 2 weeks ago: Initial symptoms headache, muscle aches, runny nose. Day 4 these symptoms were gone, then developed a mucousy cough and tachycardia, along with the limb pain I have been experiencing in my left arm and left thigh. \n* Seen at hospital for tachycardia - clear bloods, chest x-ray, discharged and told to follow up with GP. GP prescribed verapamil to lower heart rate, referred for 24 hour monitor. Heart rate is still sitting high when standing sometimes (up to 145), but does seem to be improving somewhat. \n* Started itraconazole - after 2 days, developed an itchy, fine, red rash all over my stomach and also some on my arms, legs, chest and back (allergic reaction) that lasted 6 days before disappearing.\n* Stopped itraconazole, got OTC oral thrush medication (Nystatin) and vaginal thrush treatment (Fluconazole pill and clotrimazole 6 day cream, previously used with success and no issues). Notice that at night after inserting the clotrimazole cream, I experience internal burning, pelvic area feels inflamed, and increased need to urinate, but it disappears by the morning each time. \n* Went to GP about itraconazole reaction, put back on terbinafine instead. Given ok to start the Prednisone (I avoided it while I had covid).\n* Swollen lymph node, salivary gland and along right side of jaw begin to ache. Notice neck feels as though pressure is being put on the right side of my throat, and as if food gets stuck if I dont take small bites and chew thoroughly. See different GP about this, as well as about a different medication for the oral thrush as Nystatin isnt working. Put on 1 week of antibiotics for the neck/jaw/ear issues, and switched to miconazole gel for oral thrush. Still using the clotrimazole cream. \n* After applying miconazole oral gel, tongue feels stinging and burning. A few hours later the same rash as from the itraconazole appears, I dont use the miconazole again. Begin antibiotics, finish last dose of clotrimazole cream. \n* Check my teeth to see if anything there could be causing the neck/throat/lymph node issues - notice a very tiny bump the same colour and texture as gums behind my lower right molar - possible abscess or not? \n* Wake up this morning with bad pain in the stomach area (under left ribs), slight nausea - obviously from antibiotics as suspected would happen. However, the left side of my pelvis is cramping and sore, and there is a very small amount of blood when wiping. \n\nQuestions:\n\n* Does this sound like it could be some sort of body-wide candida issue I am facing? \n* Could I possibly have esophageal thrush that has come from the oral thrush and/or suspected intestinal candida overgrowth? Could this be causing the coughing, sore and swollen lymph node and salivary gland, pressure on neck, swallowing issues? \n* Since I seem to be allergic to -azole medications, could I have damaged inside my vagina from the clotrimazole cream, and is this serious or will it heal on its own?\n* Are there any tests I can ask my GP to do to check for systemic candida issues? I have already been referred for another endoscopy because of the gastritis/SIBO/SIFO symptoms, but these take a long time to be seen for. \n* If this is body-wide fungal infections, how urgent is this to treat? \n* How can I even begin to treat fungal infections now when I cant take -azole medications? There is one different one I can try for the oral thrush, terbinafine for the toenail, but what about vaginal or intestinal thrush? There doesnt seem to be any other non-azole options I can see in my country other than Terbinafine, which I read does not treat vaginal or intestinal infections, usually just toenail, skin and scalp. \n* Any other thoughts on these symptoms, what could be causing them? What would a plan look like for testing and treating all these symptoms, and is there any hope for resolving these or being ok to travel in 2 weeks?\n\nThank you so much if you read all this and have any ideas at all.'"

Ive gotten biopsies and more medication prescriptions than I can count because I was getting a severe allergic reaction to something since 2019 and it got progressively worse over the years and was a near daily occurrence. \nUltimately, I figured out on my own that I am allergic to allergy medication. I have cat allergies and was taking cetrizine almost daily for years before the outbreak of small, flat hives started that, at first, only appeared on my hands and then progressed over many years to everywhere else on my body. I dont know if this is a factor, but these symptoms started after a very bad and traumatic breakup that caused me severe depression and anxiety and required therapy to heal from. \nAnyways, when I finally started putting the pieces together, every doctor gaslit me and told me its rare if not impossible to be allergic to allergy medicine so thats likely not it. But the condition went away the moment I stopped and comes back a few hours after I take it. \nThat being said, I still need allergy medication because I love my cat and Im allergic to her - its nothing severe just lots of sneezing and stuffy nose particularly in the mornings but otherwise gets better throughout the day. Cetrizine and Claritin have this effect on me. The only medication that doesnt is Benadryl but I was told you cant take Benadryl too frequently. So what should I do? \nTLDR: Allergic to cetrizine and claritin. Benadryl doesnt seem to have negative affect but was told you cant take it often and it only lasts 12 or so hours. What do I do to combat cat allergies? (if you say get rid of the cat pls know that I would rather die than do that. She has saved me from the brink of suicide and severe depression and has been with me through the hardest and best years of my life).'"

The only reaction I usually get from those are a scratchy throat and ears for about 24 hours. \nAnyways, I was at work on Saturday afternoon and started to feel hives forming under my face mask and on the back of my scalp. I went to the store to get some Allegra, the itchiness and hives go down and I continue to work. Then about 20 minutes later, I start to feel very dizzy and disoriented and I feel my tongue swelling while trying to talk. I sit down for a few minutes and try to get back to work but I still feel very dizzy and start shaking uncontrollably and my lips go numb and my throat starts to taste funny. My manager drives me to the emergency room where they give me IV Benadryl and cortisone and a prescription for prednisone and an epi pen. A couple hours later they release me and I go home. When I wake up the next morning I still feel jacked from the steroid and go drop off my prescription. While Im waiting for my prescription to get filled I start to see hives and feel itchy again so I walk down the block to the store to get Benadryl. I start uncontrollably shaking again and am super pale and sweaty so I take 50mg of Benadryl and someone calls an ambulance. The ambulance comes and says my vitals look good and I dont have any hives at this point so they tell me to go pick up my scripts and take the steroids and I felt instantly steadier and better when I took the steroids. Today I still feel weak and a bit disoriented. I went to work for a little while but could feel myself getting really worked up from things like carrying plates or lifting 5lbs so Ive been resting the rest of the day. I have an appointment with an allergist tomorrow but I wanted to get some feedback from docs on what this sounds like. At the hospital the doc suggested I may have had a panic attack and the emt suggested the same thing the next day but Ive never had a panic attack and dont really experience much anxiety. Even during the attacks I wasnt too panicked, just wanted to get proper treatment.
