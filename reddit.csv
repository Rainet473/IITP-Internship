anticonvulsant rash,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/rgovt6/starting_a_low_dose_of_latuda_next_week_what/,b'Starting a low dose of Latuda next week. What should I expect?',,"b""  Hello, I've gone through three different treatment medications in the past 3/4 months (Lamotrigine, Gabapentin, and now Latuda). My APRN changed my medication off of Lamotrigine because I developed the skin rash. Gabapentin wasn't terribly effectively for me so I have now been put on an antipsychotic as opposed to an anticonvulsant. I'm not sure what to expect out of the medication shift. There's going to be just a few days between when I get off of Gabapentin and start Latuda. I read that Gabapentin can be detected in your system around 3-4 days after you cease taking it, and I also read on WebMD that it is not recommended for Gabapentin and Latuda to be taken together. Furthermore, I noticed that Latuda could cause a decrease in white blood cells, this caught my attention because I am also anemic and have some mild concerns here as well. I'm waiting to get an appointment for blood work as of today. Sorry for the longish read but anything I should be concerned with? I have researched what I can but I'd like to hear if anyone has dealt with these. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks!"""

(It looks like that: https://youtu.be/VyT8DXELszE )\n\n\n\n- Abnormal eye movements  When I try to look up, and  when I look left (It looks like that: https://youtu.be/wmV0eiUd2Is ). Erratic eye movements.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was prescribed Cymbalta about 15 years ago - in my early 30s -  for severe/disabling tiredness and muscle pain. (which started suddenly at age 18. I have been on disability since 18. I am still very ill and in pain and my condition has deteriorated.)\n\n\n\nI was on Cymbalta for only about 3 or 4 months. I don't remember the dosage. I was feeling even more ill and tired on Cymbalta. I stopped taking it because I was too ill to get to the pharmacy to get my prescription renewed. I stopped suddenly and got brain zaps for a while, which then stopped.\n\n\n\nThe reason for my question:\n\n\n\nI am aware of the eyelid tremors and the facial tremors since around the time I took Cymbalta. I definitely remember having the mouth/cheek tremors while I was on Cymbalta and that these tremors got worse and worse.\n\n\nThe problem: I am not certain if I had those eyelid &  facial tremors BEFORE taking Cymbalta or not.\n\n\nI never discussed it with a doctor because I assumed they would never take these symptoms seriously as my local GPs (Ireland) have only always dismissed and ignored my symptoms. The doctor who prescribed the Cymbalta was a locum GP from New Zealand filling in for my GP for their 2 weeks holiday.\n\n\n\nI especially would like some answers as to why my eyes make the erratic movements. I only became aware of that symptom around 2 years ago, but it might have started earlier and I just wasn't aware. I had been wondering if it was a symptom of the disabling condition I am suffering from.\n\n\n\nBut yesterday I had a lightbulb moment and wondered if the answer is in fact simple: could the abnormal eye movements, the eyelid tremors and the facial tremors be consequences of having taken Cymbalta? Could they be long-lasting side effects of Cymbalta?\n\n\n\nI would really appreciate your help, thank you very much."""

I\'m gonna go ahead and apologize bc this will be a long one.\n\nI\'m a 33f, always been described as bouncy, fluffy and basically a hyper person. It\'s something managed and dealt with my whole life. I get extremely productive spikes and then will randomly just be an absolute goblin refusing to do even basic needs like taking a shower. \nI collect hobbies, diving into them feverishly, only to randomly lose all interest, allowing stuff to sit on a shelf never or rarely to be messed with again.\nI will be the best, most attentive friend and then fall off the face of the earth.\nI am incredibly spontaneous and will randomly just decided to take off for the day but at the same time panic about walking into a Lowe\'s because idk \n\nThese are all things I\'ve managed. I\'ve also had social anxiety, but it was mainly centered around new situations and would generally go away once I was actively in those moments. I found smoking the devil lettuce was also something I really only enjoyed doing by myself as it would spike my social anxiety around people.\n\nHowever in Mar. 2023, I had three sicknesses back to back. Nothing major but enough to take it\'s toll, the last one being possible strep so I was put on amoxicillin. \n\nAbout day two into amoxicillin I was out in my garage, normal day, took a hit off a bowl (I\'ve always been an extreme light weight so I stick to flower and maybe two hits is all I need) then went inside.\n\nI suddenly had a massive breakdown. Extreme panic attack. Had to call my s/o to come home.\n\nThe next 2 weeks was a state of nothing but panic attacks. Constantly in the mornings. I could not escape my head. My thoughts were racing so fast that it made me feel like every second I was about to take off running. I felt absolutely out of my mind and yet paralyzed inside of it. Could not stop the panic attacks so went to my doctor. In that time I also entirely stopped smoking weed and drinking caffeine as it was proving to be a trigger. I still have not resumed either of those things.\n\nAt first she was sure it was a thyroid storm brought on by the sicknesses. However after three different blood tests, urine test and even a EKG everything came back... Fine. My thyroid was perfectly healthy. In that time she had put me on Propanol to lower my heart rate (as it was elevated when she saw me) and given Lorazepam for spikes (that stuff was wonderful at making me feel almost normal again but I avoided taking it unless absolutely necessary bc of potential for addiction) \n\nSo she went on to give me stuff for a possible anxiety related illness. Continue Lorazepam only for spikes and wanted to start me on Lexapro (5mg as I am very small 104 pounds and previously all medications I\'ve needed a lower dose) Lexapro was an absolute nightmare. I was back to the peak of the episode that started this whole thing. Stuck inside my head, mornings I was an absolute jittery mess on the edge of panic attack. I would have to get up 3 hours before I needed to leave the house because I\'d spend 2 hrs laying in bed in an attempt to calm myself enough to just get ready for the day. Zero appetite, zero sex drive (least of my problems) extremely irritable. \n\nFor some reason I convinced myself I was being dramatic and stuck it out for a week before I reached out to my doctor who immediately said I needed to stop taking it. \n\nWithin 4 days things leveled back out, I still don\'t feel like who I was before this whole thing started. For context I was VERY happy. I had, in the passed two years, finally fell in love with.myself. I enjoyed who I was, was very confident in myself and loved life. I barely had any sort of anxiety. Now I no longer can have coffee, can smoke to relieve stress (those two really are just kind of sad not my main issues) I live with anxiety every single day. The mornings still being the worst part of it. But no longer spiraling like I was at the beginning of this or on the Lexapro. \n\nOnce things leveled, my doctor had me answer a bunch of questions. She even said she was so surprised bc at the start of this she could of swore it was just a thyroid storm. However I never really had told her about any of my daily issues, bc before this, they really were not something that bothered me. I loved when I became wildly productive and yes it did suck when I\'d suddenly lose it half way through some random project but I managed. After speaking she has stated she believes i could be bipolar and asked if id be comfortable trying medication for it. \n\nI have to admit, after the Lexapro I am very very apprehensive. It took me right back to when this whole ordeal started and it was terrifying. Every day felt like a month and I was physically fighting it felt like just to do basic tasks. But I also know that whatever started all this wasn\'t medication and could happen again. I just want to be back to the person I was before all this, if that\'s even possible. \n\nI guess I am attempting to see if my experience matches any of you here. I must admit I don\'t know very much about bi polar and if any of this are things you\'ve all dealt with. I\'m looking for information, I haven\'t given my doctor a yes or no yet. As of right now I am ""ok"" (again not who I was before all this still very low energy, higher anxiety and just not myself) but I worry about doing nothing. Any advice or insight on this absolute girthy tale is going to be VERY appreciated. \n\nKeep being fantastic everyone!'"

NSAID problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/105vnhi/intermittent_inconsistent_pain_following_molar/,"b'Intermittent, inconsistent pain following molar crown w/o root canal: what to do?'",,"b'So, Im hoping someone here can offer some suggestions as to what might be going on, and thoughts on how I might proceed. \n\nThe detailed section is long (to provide a complete picture). \n\nTLDR version: can prednisone resolve severe pain following a crown without a root canal, or is it likely to just be a bandaid, and the pain will return when the steroids are stopped?\n\nTo note, Im a lupus patient on long-term immunosuppressants (no regular steroids as part of my treatment, though) with a co-morbid fibromyalgia dx. Pre-appt antibiotics were taken before every appt. History of right-side trigeminal neuralgia (neurogenic, secondary to lupus), considered resolved in 2014. That, uncontrolled, would be a 9 on my personal pain scale, for reference. Wisdom teeth removed 20 years ago. \n\nTimeline:\n\n-Late October: Fillings were placed on #15 in late October, following acute onset unprompted pain and temperature sensitivity (cold and heat). Unprompted pain stopped and sensitivity was significantly reduced, but not resolved. \n\n\n-12/29: crown placed on #15 due to lingering sensitivity and desire to intervene before more extensive treatment would be needed (I pushed for this); no root canal performed. Immediately after the local anesthetic starts to wear off, I start to feel a severe pain, with a pressure or crushing sensation. The crown is not pressing on #14, and the gums dont show any signs of infection or flawed margins. The tooth is hypersensitive to cold and pressure; no reaction to heat or light touch. No signs of infection or abscess were noted. Pain level consistently at an 8-8.5. \n\n-1/3: no improvement in pain level when unmedicated. Pain mostly controlled when taking acetaminophen, Toradol, baclofen, and low dose opioids (all prescribed under a pre-planned protocol for the express purpose of controlling severe pain when it appears until the cause can be addressed, in hopes of avoiding triggering a neuro lupus complication that basically prompts a pain feedback loop; I can detail this further if necessary, but this event did not trigger this complication, and this is the first time Ive needed to use this protocol in 7 years). As soon as each dose starts to wear off, the pain returns full force. Toradol, as an extremely potent NSAID, has a strict 5 day limit (before the risk of organ damage and GI bleeds becomes too high), so the afternoon was the last time I was able to take this med. In the evening, I was told to take 5mg prednisone and hydroxyzine for a minor allergic reaction (completely unrelated to the dental issue).\n\n-1/4: upon waking up, even though the Toradol and other pain meds are out of my system, the pain is greatly reduced. Down to a 3-4 at most, and part of that is simply jaw pain after the past 5 days of hell. I see my dentist to check the tooth and make sure there are still no visible problems (none noted), and then my endodontist for a scheduled root canal on #21 (scheduled weeks ago). The endo also notes no obvious signs or issues, and double checks via X-ray. At this point, Ive taken 2.5mg of prednisone that morning, along with Tylenol and naproxen (taken daily for lupus arthritis). The pain has remained steady and lowered. \n\n-1/4 afternoon: 2 hours after leaving the endo, I drink some cold water and the pain in #15 immediately returns to an 8-8.5, and stays there for the rest of the day. \n\n1/5-present: Ive consistently taken 5mg prednisone, and while Ive had a brief period or 2 where the pain returned to a 6-7, it has largely stayed at or below a 3 (at most), without taking anything besides the Tylenol and naproxen I already take daily. \n\n*********************************************\nMy question: is the prednisones effect at calming the pain likely to be temporary, and should I proceed with a root canal on #15 on Monday? Or is it possible that the prednisone will solve whatever caused that pain to begin with? I need help deciding how to proceed, because I cant take Toradol again for a month (very strict instructions, and the consequences for not following them are life-threatening), and the endo typically doesnt have availability for 5-7 days after calling (at the earliest). I cant handle that level of pain, for that duration, with no relief (if the prednisone doesnt work next time).\n\n*Edited to add: Ive never smoked, and I havent had any alcohol since before this started. I only drink socially and infrequently. \n\nAlso, I dont blame my dentist or anyone else; theyve been wonderful. Weird medical issues, especially involving cranial/facial nerves, arent new for me. I fully believe this problem was prompted by my pre-existing medical issues.'"

I felt a sense of nothingness and had serious trouble sleeping (neither of which I ever had in the past). This continued in ebbs and flows and I tried to grind my way through it in college. This, of course, came with serious consequences. I would lay in bed for hours in the dark with all the blinds closed. My health went in a downwards spiral as I didn\'t eat much or go to the gym. I destroyed my relationship with my S/O - piling everything on her like a personal therapist. I wasn\'t interested in hanging out with my friends.

Racing thoughts like ""what the hell is happening to me?""\n* I was constantly in a state of worry, racing thoughts, and inability to have a calm state of mind.\n\n\nAfter I had broken up with my S/O *over text* (appalling) and didn\'t care at all that that was a horrible approach, refusing to communicate...finally I went in search for help. \n\n\nI saw a therapist and he and I began to rule out every possible cause of these negative feelings. Relationship, weather, workload, etc. After he brought up a possible cause of it being organic, I immediately called the dermatologist and asked if minocycline could have such effects. The doctor said that was not possible. I looked online, and people just like me were writing stories about similar experiences. Depersonalization, seemingly, is a rare side effect of this medication. \n\n\nI went to the pharmacist and requested a refill history. There was a gap in between fall and spring semesters where I wasn\'t taking this medication. I remember distinctly a time over winter break where I was crying profusely about being under stress and my career prospects. I had not cried at all (I was incapable of feeling both good and bad emotions) in these 6 months, except during that gap. \n\n\nI went off minocycline and within days I noticed improvements. I gradually began to part with anxiety like an old friend. I started to challenge myself to do new things rather than chase happiness as a feeling. A few weeks later on a road trip with my family I was beaming and talking excitedly the entire 13 hour car ride. I was finally able to cry about my relationship. Crying never felt so...*good*.\n\n\nI don\'t know if there are any credible studies about the psychological effects of minocycline, but I have good reason to believe minocycline adversely affected my mental health for about 6 months and ruined my last year of college.\n\n\nI urge you to seek help if you\'re having mental health problems. Shutting people out, as I found out the hard way, will only make things worse. There a lot of people out there who love and support you.\n\n\n'"

I just thought I\'d have better luck finding someone who can give advice than if I put venting. But if I used this incorrectly I\'m happy to remove it.\n\nI\'m 29m, unemployed but I\'m currently living in my parents house so expenses are minimal, but the sense of guilt is pretty high.\n\nI have this vague sense of anxiety and loneliness all the time. My mind spirals out of control over any unpleasant thought to the point I\'m not always sure what\'s real. I want to have people around me and feel loved, and cared for, and valued, but I also just can\'t stand being around people. Same problem with always wanting physical contact. It\'s like why can\'t we just have a full conversation that\'s deep and meaningful and makes me feel cared for while being held by someone that loves me, but at the same time not have anyone else in the room or even earshot of me. I really hate talking to people. \n\nI\'m always scared of every thing and it limits my ability to do things including leaving the house or in some cases my bedroom. And the depression is so bad I just kind of always want to give up just a little literally all the time. \n\nI get angry or annoyed easily and sometimes I just have these little outbursts that I can\'t control and don\'t remember. Not like violent or crossing a line. But like a teenager yelling ""you don\'t care about me!"" When they\'re feeling overwhelmed. Which I guess is just me feeling overwhelmed kind of always. \n\nMy girlfriend of about a year and a half and I have been kind of drifting apart lately, In the sense that were always arguing about something stupid, usually her mom being unfair to us. She just kind of wants to deal with it but her mom always says things to target me. And I can\'t control it I just start shit. The other night she told her mom we were arguing and she was considering ending the relationship. Her mom jumped on board and they had a long talk about why she should. This is shortly after the mom banned me from the house for texting her when she\'d be home so I knew if we could go to my sister\'s rehearsal dinner or not. I was overly polite. Her mom is now making her feel uncomfortable for choosing not to break up with me. \n\nI\'m also not entirely sure she\'s really not going to break up with me, things have been different between us since her mom started making her feel uncomfortable. But I have a hard time with intrusive thoughts so I have no idea if it\'s really her mom, or her, or why she\'s even trying to stay with me. And talking to her about it is difficult, mostly because she\'s stressed and doesn\'t want to. I\'m trying to get her some space but it\'s just so hard, especially knowing her only housemate is against our relationship and vocal about it.\n\nI can\'t stand being alone. This is unrelated to the girlfriend. I just can\'t take being by myself or the idea that one day I\'ll be living on the streets with no way to support myself because of my mental health. I have a cat, her name is Beetle. Beetle is the only thing that really brings me any joy in life these days. I don\'t get along with my family. I\'m ruining my one real human connection. I don\'t have a job or hobbies to bring me any joy and I just can\'t manage to bring myself to do or stay with any activity. And Ive had jobs before, but since COVID and the stress of some new family developments, my mental health is so bad I don\'t know if I can hold down a job. Made worse by my last job, I was fired for not wanting to make outbound sales calls, which as an analyst was outside the scope of my position anyway.\n\nI\'ve tried therapy many times and I know the root of many of my problems, but not how to fix it them.

I take Adderall and Ambien daily currently, but I\'ve been on SSRIs and antianxiety meds in the past with very little success.\n\nI\'m not ""looking for a way out"". But I just feel so trapped and bad all the time. The constant need to feel not alone, but the inability and distain for talking to people. The fact I can\'t just happy, always spiralling from any intrusive thought, even stuff that doesn\'t matter. I just ruin everything I touch and idk if I can even really feel bonds with people. I\'m stuck. I can\'t do anything. And I just don\'t want to feel this way anymore.\n\nThank you for letting me vent, and please, if you have any suggestions or thoughts, let me know.

Trees, grass, weeds, dust. Dander. It's insane. I don't have congestion issues really. My nose doesn't run, and even if it's clogged a simple sinus rinse fixes it right up. \n\nI use flonase and that keeps my nose relatively fine and tidy. Can breathe just fine in the middle of spring. \n\nBut oh my God, my eyes. It's not an 'itch' to me. But, swelling. Every day the inner corners of my eyes are beat red. Behind my eyes it feels like someone is trying to inflate a balloon behind them. \n\nIf I press my finger underneath my eye and manage to feel what's behind it, it's so tender and swollen. When I close my eyes really hard, it's that spot behind my eye that tightens it. That muscle I guess? Nearly impossible to reach.\n\nI have no idea how to treat it.. Alaway doesn't work, Flonase doesn't work, dry eye drops like Sistane don't work either. The ONLY thing that seems to work is Pataday extra strength, and strong corticosteroids like Prisidone. The Pataday application lasts for maybe 3-4 hours until they swell right back up again. \n\nI know Prisidone works because I'm currently on allergy shots to try to deal with this, and they required me to take those for a few days before going into the rush method of immunotherapy. It was a few blessed days of feeling 'normal for the first time in a year and a half.\n\nUnfortunately I was told I can't take those long term :/ I take Allegra twice a day and it helps a little bit but not much. Zyrtec helped a little more but made me dead tired every day. \n\nI just don't know what to do besides take Pataday extra strength multiple times a day but you can't really do that. I'm only two months into immunotherapy but it'll take a while for that to work (if at all) I feel like I'm just driven insane by swollen eyes every day and it totally zaps my energy and gives me headaches all the time. \n\nAny tips?\n\nEdit: I have already changed my diet, and put on allergy covers on my pillow and bedroom.

For the past 2 years, it has been extremely frustrating as I've started having dyspnoea as well (which my doctor suspects might be a product of bad sleep, anxiety and possibly the nasal congestion). They did different tests, x-rays to exclude other possible causes for my breathlessness and dyspnoea, they were fine. I have been sleeping horribly with constant anxiety, but the worst of it has been the nasal congestion that's become much worse than before. It has reached a point where I sometimes don't sleep at all, well a lot of the times I don't sleep. I'm lucky if I can sleep 3-5 hours per night. Last year, I had a septoplasty due to enlarged turbinates and obviously my deviated septum. It worked for maybe a month or less before the congestion returned. About 6 or 7 months ago I had a radiofrequency turbinate reduction, and I didn't see any very noticeable results. So I've been keeping in touch with my doctors, whom now think that I have vasomotor rhinitis. I have done allergy tests, and I'm supposedly allergic to pollen, timothy/grass, birch, mugwort, dog etc. But since I have problems with my congestion year around, they suspect vasomotor rhinitis being the culprit. Now I'm set up for an upcoming rhinomanometry (measure airflow and resistance in nose), before they decide if I should have any further surgeries and to get deeper insight. I'm really helpless here, I mean I've tried antihistamine pills, nasal sprays containing antihistamine and fluticasone (corticosteroids), nose oil, nasal rinses, nasal dilators but nothing seems to yield any results. Does anyone have similar experiences, or just any advice at all? It's making my life unbearable. I sometimes use nasal decongestant sprays, but rarely, as I don't want to make it a habit or become dependent of it. Not sure what to do anymore. I'm afraid of developing Empty Nose Syndrome if I keep doing something to my turbinates, but at the same time I already feel like complete shit because of my crappy life quality.

We didn\'t know what caused them and he was put on warfarin (was told that he would likely be on it for life). Fast forward to July of this year and we take him back to the hospital due to trouble breathing. Turns out he did have another PE (which we suspected already just due to his symptoms). They check his INR and it is at a 1.1. We are stunned by this, as he had been taking his meds like he was told (he took 15mg of warfarin every day except weekends. Everyone we talked to thought this was a crazy high dosage, but this is the dosage they came up with in the hospital the first time, because anything less than that did not get him into therapeutic range). The doctor this time recommended moving him to a different blood thinner (I think it was Xarelto, but I could be mistaken). This blood thinner was mentioned the first time but they didn\'t put him on it because they said at the time it did not have a lot of studies with obese patients. But the doc said now there were more studies on it that found it to be safe. And he said that warfarin is a terrible blood thinner. They did surgery to remove this clot, because it was very big and too dangerous to try just a heparin drip alone. They thought they got all the clots out, but I guess they didn\'t. A few days later, they wanted him to walk around before he was discharged. When he stood up, he passed out and his heart stopped. They did cpr and gave him several bolus doses of heparin (I believe that\'s what was in the bolus. Sorry, the exact facts of when he was dying are fuzzy to me). Ultimately, they weren\'t able to save him. They said what likely happened is that he still had a clot somewhere that dislodged when he stood up and went to his heart, stopping it. Where I\'m at a loss is this: how is it possible that his INR was so low when he was taking his meds as he was supposed to? I know for a fact he was taking them because I was the one that gave them to him every night. And I made sure he took them. Can you become warfarin resistant?

I feel like every time I get a little weight off then I end up injured and the weight comes back. \n\nI can't tell you how many diets/cookbooks/apps I've tried- I've spent over $1,600 at least on different subscriptions to various lifestyle changes. My latest thing now is possibly getting the ball rolling for bariatric surgery. If not covered by Medicaid then I'll need to save up close to $8,000 to have the procedure done.\n\nI'm trying so hard. It doesn't feel like I have a way forward. Medically- they can't figure out the pressure and tension in my head  that has caused me pain since November 2018. My weight is NOT the reason but until I'm able to at least show some sort of weight loss they won't do anything. I'm just not sure where to go anymore. \n\nI'm the most depressed I've ever been and maybe coincidentally am on the biggest cocktail of drugs. \n\nBuSpar 30mg BID\nEmgality 120mg x 1 every 30 days\nGeodon 80mg  BID\nGabapentin (300mg morning & afternoon- bedtime 900mg)\nJanumet XR 1,000-100 MG combo pill\nLamictal 100mg \nMinipress 1mg at bedtime \nProvigil 400mg \nRobaxin 500 mg  TID\nWellbutrin 75 mg \n\nI meet with my psychiatrist on December 14th. Not sure how it's going to go - it seems like none of the changes we are making are really working. I've done genetic testing and even though I tried almost every SSRI/SNRI (antidepressants,).\nSeveral  anxiolytics (anxiety meds), antipsychotics (both typical and atypical) , mood stabilizers, and stimulant out there.\n\n I've been in active weekly therapy since April 2020 doing DBT and EMDR. I have a case worker through Parkview Behavioral Health and through Anthem.  Not sure what else I can really do externally to fix my internally messed up head. \n\nAny light bulb moment or revelation of wisdom about ANY of my stack of problems would be appreciated. Now that this took me a solid 2 hours to get out as a whole post I guess just send any thoughts"""

I\'ve never felt euphoric or had mania although I\'ve had periods that doctors and healthcare staff thought were hypomania, but not necessarily with a great increase in mood (stuff like severe agitation and having to leave the house and be constantly busy and physically moving, otherwise I\'ll ""go down"" if I stop; periods of staying up for 3 days at a time unable to sleep even with medication; periods where I start a million and one things and finish zero of them).\n\nI\'ve always been in the middle with the diagnosis - it was made by a private consultant psychiatrist so someone with great experience and skill, however, I personally feel as though I never really have felt ""happy"" let alone euphoric. Some doctors have suggested drug resistant depression, others just depression and anxiety, others see that the diagnosis was made by a consultant and just agree with it due to the hierarchy on the healthcare system. \n\nI have been on and tried the following medications: \n\nFluoxetine\nCitalopram\nMirtazapine\nSertraline\nQuetiapine \n\nFluox was stopped after 8 weeks as it did nothing for me at all at the time and made my moods even less stable. Citalopram worked for 8-10 months, but I gained over 3.5st in weight and lost all sexual appetite, desire and had problems with erections and ejaculations. In the end, the mood lifting effects stopped working and I just got side effects which led to anger problems, and I came off it when I started being angry all the time that I\'d smash things. \n\nMirtazapine I was on for around 2 years - it did ZERO my mood but was a perfect sleep aid which was great at the time as I was at university. So I hung on to it like a life jacket even though my mood got lower and lower and lower. Eventually when I was leaving university I went back to my doctors and told them that even at 45mg it was not touching my mood. I had few side effects with mirtazapine compared to SSRIs, it just didn\'t work. We came off it. \n\nThen I was put on Sertraline in 2014 and I stayed on it until 2017, so over three years. It worked amazing at first with regards to my mood, then we kept having to increase the dose and I went through hypomanic episodes and thus quetiapine was introduced. After a few months quetiapine was stopped due to weight gain, being tired ALL the time (14 hours asleep anyone?) and the fact it lowered my mood hugely. I stayed on Sertraline for a while but as we increased the dose the sexual side effects got more pronounced, similar to citalopram. I met a guy last year and this became a huge problem, so my doctor agreed to try weaning off it. It took around 3.5 months.\n\nUnfortunately within 3 months my depression was back and by this point I had taken a job in the emergency services working for the police, as a 999 call handler. I had a week with 6 preventable, avoidable deaths regarding car accidents, suicides and such like and my anxiety SOARED --  and my mood plummeted ever since.\n\nOn January 3rd we started me back on Sertraline. I\'m back at 150mg which used to be my ""it kind of works but god these sexual side effects are ruining my relationship and self esteem"" dose. Except now it\'s April.... and the Sertraline has not even touched my mood at all. Zero. I am as depressed as ever before, and yet the side effects all started within 4-7 days of starting the medication. So at the moment I am getting side effects for 4 months but no or little noticeable response with regards to depression or anxiety. \n\n2 weeks ago I attempted suicide taking my second barbiturate overdose and then trying to strangle myself. I was assessed twice by the in-hospital psych team and the crisis and home rehab team and was deemed well enough to stay at home and ""go back to my GP"" for my 3rd or 4th referral to the community mental health team. I am still waiting to hear from them. \n\nI keep screaming that I hate SSRIs, and they don\'t care. I want to try bupropion - but it\'s rarely prescribed in this country (UK), may not be available in my area and may not be ""clinically appropriate"" according to my doctor. He said he no longer feels confident dealing with medications or prescriptions as I know more than he does about non-SSRIs and other MH drugs (he said there are 6 drugs he regularly prescribes for depression and that\'s it). He said he wants any medication and prescribing to be done by a psychiatrist, so I have to wait for the referral to go through which could be another few weeks minimum. He told me to stay on Sertraline until then.\n\nAnyone have any experience with bupropion? He told me to print out as much evidence as possible and to fight my case, but that he wasn\'t the right person to hear it. He accused me of trying to emotionally blackmail him in to prescribing, saying if the medication had any toxic effects that it would or could be him standing in the Coroner\'s Court -- I said if I were to jump from a 5 storey building it would most likely end in him standing in the Coroner\'s Court too. We then apologised and he just said to try and get as much evidence as possible for bupropion to present when I see the psychiatrist and if he doesn\'t prescribe it on the NHS, I may consider a private prescription. However he reiterated if it was not prescribed due to it not being ""clinically appropriate"" for me that even paying for a private prescription wouldn\'t help there as the same rules apply. I said if that\'s the case, I will purchase it myself from an IOP -- he said he strongly advised against this, reiterated that was a prescription only drug but admitted it was not a controlled drug, and said essentially he could not stop me if I was that desperate to try it. \n\nThe thing that pisses me off, is he kept saying ""you don know it\'d work"". I said... we don\'t know what will work until we try it. We didn\'t know about fluoexetine, citalopram, mirtazapine, citalopram, etc. and that\'s we gave them a minimum of a 6-8 week trial. He then said maybe look at venlafaxine, to which I replied you mean an SNRI? One that shares like 95% of the side effect profile of SSRIs and similar efficacy? The ones I have such issues with, be it then not working, or them working but causing such side effects that I cannot stand being on them long term. He apologised.\n\nIt\'s like this. Over here in the UK, SSRIs are cheap, safe and given out like sweets.\n\nThey all work primarily on maintaining higher serotonin levels in the brain.\n\nBut I don\'t get along with them.\n\nCoincidentally, some of the most effective antidepressants are MAOIs - which don\'t significantly work on serotonin, yet can show great results. However they are old, there are side effects relating to your diet and require blood monitoring when on them as they are potentially very dangerous. They are rarely prescribed. MAOIs are not SSRIs or SNRIs and does not share the same side effect profile.\n\nBupropion isn\'t an SSRI either and it too does not share the same side effect profile. It is rarely prescribed here.\n\nNow call me insane, but this just reeks of politics, money, and the ""SSRIs are the silver bullet!"" bandwagon that\'s been rolling ever since the creation of Prozac.\n\nAm I really that unreasonable wanting to give a drug a TRIAL and a) not expecting them (NHS) to pay for it and b) realising it may not work and hence would be a trial.... like every other drug when they\'re first prescribed to me?\n\nArgh.

dilaudid,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/12y0eax/being_on_the_other_side_as_a_patient_having_your/,"b'Being on the other side as a patient, having your pain questioned is frustrating..'",,"b'I\'ve been sitting with my thoughts about this all weekend. \n\nAs an oculoplastics surgeon, I rarely have to prescribe opiates except for our really big cases and that is usually a total of 10 pills or so. I rarely have to deal with patients demanding pain medications so I am somewhat removed from that aspect of medicine.\n\nI personally have been of the mentality that less is better when it comes to opiates. I encourage patients to try to get by with Tylenol and after 48 hours I encourage adding nsaids to maximize pain control without opiates. Before this weekend, I had never had any opiates for any pain issues myself.\n\nThis weekend, I had an accidental trauma where I injured my hip and back after falling off my bike. I initially felt okay and was trying to just push through the soreness. A few hours after the injury, I started having pain severe enough that I couldn\'t even focus on people talking to me and at one point almost past out. It was an intense abdominal pain radiating to my back. It was bad enough, that I wanted to rule out internal bleeding as the cause.\n\nI went to the ER and was giving a fast exam by one of the attendings. Everything looked good but I was told if the pain got worse to come back for a CT scan. \n\nI woke up at 1 am with the most intense pain I\'ve ever felt. My LUQ was throbbing near 10/10.\n\nI went back to the ER to get a CT and further work up. I was first seen by the PA. He asked me if I wanted any pain meds. I told him, I have never taken opiates and was a little apprehensive about it but would go with whatever he recommended. He ordered me 0.5 mg of Dilaudid. I weigh 170 lbs and was told this was a small dose.\n\nAfter about an hour the PA came back to check on me and ask how my pain was doing. I told him I hadn\'t noticed much change. He said it was a pretty small dose so he would look into giving me something else.\n\nOver the next few hours, I get moved to CT and other imaging studies. After getting back to the room and getting settled, my pain was increasing again. I realized at this time the Dilaudid was actually helping more than I realized but was wearing off.\n\nI called for the nurse to ask about getting another dose. Instead of the nurse coming, the attending physician came in the room. She performed an exam on me. She asked me to move my extremities, flex my spine. I told her that my muscles and joints felt fine, I had no mobility issues, but something internal in my LUQ felt like it was spasming and causing severe pain. She rolled her eyes (not sure if she knew I was a physician or not, I didn\'t mention it to anyone except the PA on check in. Not that it matters in regards to how I should be treated as a patient but the disregard of care felt extra insulting). I\'m too tired and in too much pain to make a fuss.\n\nShe leaves saying she will see what she can do to get my pain better controlled. Another hour passes with no meds. I pop my head out the door and see the resident that was with the attending earlier. I ask if I can get more pain control. She says ""well since the Dilaudid didn\'t work for you, we are trying to figure out what would be better to give you"". I explain to her the Dilaudid probably helped more then I realized because I\'m in much worse pain now and if nothing else will be better then nothing. She agrees to put in another order.\n\nFinally get my dose. Knocks off the pain enough to get a few minutes of sleep. The resident comes back in and says that CT scan is normal. They think most likely this may be a deep iliac or paraspinal muscle spasm from the fall and that\'s why it\'s radiating to my abdomen. \n\nI\'m happy that I don\'t have any serious internal injury. Pain is starting to alleviate a bit. I\'m ready to go home and back to my bed. The nurse comes in to go over discharge. I notice there are no pain meds rxd for discharge. I ask to talk with the resident about it. I explain to the resident, that i only slept 15 minutes all night because of the pain keeping me up and that was with two doses of 0.5 mg Dilaudid and I wanted to have a short supply of something in case the pain returned to severe levels. She tells me they only like to prescribe opiates for broken bones but she will talk to her attending. She came back and said she will give me a total of 5 tabs which I was fine with. \n\nWhat bothers me is not so much the cautiousness around the opiates but the feelings of my pain levels being dismissed. It felt like the resident and doctor believed unless they could see evidence of injury (e.g broken bones) then the pain was not with treating. The resident even said something to the effect of ""haven\'t you had pain like this before when you\'ve falling off your bike"".

Both went very well and recovered with no ishues. \nALLERGIES: none\nOCCUPATION:housekeeper at long term / complex care facility.\n\nI dont even know where to start but here we go. September 2021 I had a hysterectomy. I had been on testosterone for 8 years and had tolerated transition very well with no side effects. I have not had a period since 2 months into testosterone. Estrogen was suppressed by testosterone. \nOct 2021 I noticed my face and neck to be quite red but otherwise felt okay, Ive always been abit red. Jan 2022 was extremely fatigued I couldnt stop sleeping felt very off. feb 2022 developed congestion , dry watery eyes , night sweats and then one night I woke out of sleep gasping for air and was extremely out of breath I was sweating like crazy I felt almost delusional I felt so ill. The next few nights I had similar but less intense experience. During this time it was found that my bathroom had been leaking and mold was found and cleaned up ( mostly) I had taken about 3 days off work. I then returned to work and started to have a lot of chest pain, racing heart. I couldnt walk far with out becoming out of breath and having severe chest pain. I ended up having such severe pain I went to hospital and they told me I had chest wall inflammation and to take Advil and  rushed me out. I took about 5 days off work I felt okay when resting however laying flat I could not breath and I had a lot of pain at night so I propped my self up and felt better. I started to feel alot better and I returned to work. I kept having shortness of breath, chest pain, hot flashes, alot more anxiety then normal. It really seemed like out of nowhere my heart would just pound. At night I kept gasping for air it got to the point I was scared to sleep. My family doctor was away for all of this and I had seen her replacement who suggested I had costochronditus. So I went to my physio and he was a-bit stumped on that as he didnt think that would effect breathing so much as it wasnt just painful to breathe it actually was hard to breathe. My family doctor returned and said she thinks its my hormones and long story short shes been blaming it on estrogen withdrawal  do to hysterectomy. However my endocrinologist who is well known for working with trans patients said its EXTREMELY-unlikely especially as I had been on testosterone for so long with out a period . But my family doctor will not budge. I have had so many symptoms its overwhelming to even list.\n-Scalp rash / erythema \n-Red face and flushing of face \n-Flushing of body   \nWatery dry eyes / eye infections \n- shortness of breath ( even just from folding laundry)\n-extreme fatigue \n-Diarrhoea and  Constipation\n- increased sore joints \n- pain in sternum and to left on ribs\n- chest pain\n-tongue swellling and tingling , tongue also turned completely white with teeth marks but it is not a film and cant be scraped. \n- migraines (getting better)\n- itchy skin \n- ringing in ears and thudding in ears when moving even slightly \n- wake up with sore throat\n-green and yellowish phlegm(improved)\n- generally feeling of unwell.\n\nI no longer wake up up gasping for air some symptoms have improved very slowly , and others seem worse . I havent worked nearly a year.

Medical history is significant for Persistent Depression with anxiety, PTSD with panic attacks and derealization, and chronic migraine. \n\nHPI\n\n* The body pain has lasted approximately 12 years and is progressively worsening over time. The pain is achy and is more intense in the lower extremities than upper extremities. The lower extremities also have episodic tingling lasting multiple hours per day. LE pain is worse in mornings and improves with exercise, but is then worse at the end of the day leading to RLS. Muscles are constantly tight. Nearly all joints pop loudly on active and passive motion. Slow to recover from weight lifting. \n   * NSAIDs do not improve the pain. Gabapentin takes the edge off. Duloxetine has notably decreased pain, but am at 90mg (30mg more than evidence supports). Venlafaxine helped but caused shaking. Fluoxetine and escitalopram did not improve sx. Orthotic insoles did not significantly help LE pain or back pain. *Hot water baths decrease LE pain considerably.* *Placing legs up towards ceiling decreases pain temporarily.* \n   * Mildly elevated CK\n* Non Refreshing sleep has lasted approximately 15 years when I was sleeping through most of my high school/middle school classes. Excessive daytime sleepiness occurred throughout life. Takes 15-30 min to fall asleep. Occasional insomnia >4 hours. Hypnogogic hallucinations of ""exploding head syndrome,"" musical hallucinations (every night), and occasional hypnogogic visual hallucinations of ""waviness"". On waking in morning, pt takes > 6 hours for sleep inertia to be relieved. Endorses occasional ""sleep drunkenness,"" persistent brain fog, occasional difficulty understanding speech, and moderate/persistent word finding. Gaps of time disappear quickly and easily. Pt has multiple witnessed gasping events. Roughly 6 naps per day without medication, and 2 naps per day with medication. \n   * Caffeine is effective in relieving EDS but have only started drinking in the past few years, and caffeine increases body pain over time. Quitting caffeine decreases pain but worsens EDS. Bupropion minorly improved sx. Armodafinil 200mg initially improved sx, but now ineffective (Modafinil caused headaches). Adderall ER 30mg greatly improved EDS and depressive sx for >3 months. \n      * Home sleep study: all negative (patient did not sleep, but EEG says otherwise)\n      * Hospital sleep study: Dx with RLS\n      * Hospital sleep study with mslt: all negative (including RLS)\n   * (Ropinirole and Pramipexole ineffective for RLS. Gabapentin 600mg has given some relief.)\n   * (Adderall and armodafinil are prescribed for severe EDS/hypersomnia, but I did not meet criteria of idiopathic hypersomnia. Thus insurance denies Xywav.)\n\nPMH\n\n* PDD with anxiety diagnosed 3 years ago. Positive for all SIGECAPS except suicidality. Improvement in all depressive symptoms over past 3 years despite switching SSRIs frequently (>3 months each). Episodic recurrences lasting 2-3 weeks with increasing levels of body pain and EDS then sx subside without intervention. *Currently in refractory episode.* \n   * TSH and T4 are WNL. Vit D wnl. \n* PTSD with panic attacks and derealization diagnosed 3 years ago. Panic attacks 1x/2 wks since inciting incident and PTSD diagnosis. Pt was chased for extended time mugged in foreign city. CBT and xanax prn have improved intensity and decreased frequency of panic attacks. *Panic attacks occur only 3 times/yr now.* \n* Migraines >15 month. Treated with CGRP antagonist. Decreased to \\~3 month responding to triptans. Following with neuro. \n   * Hit in head with rifle butt at 8yo leading to large mildly erythematous swelling on forehead. Did not go to hospital. Did not pass out. No other recognizably related symptoms. \n* Recent MRI taken for chronic migraine and very mild nystagmus.

Treatment has at least improved my life granted it isn\'t a cure. \n* Psych Etiology: I think I have too many neurological symptoms to think this is a pure psychological issue. However, I have so many negative test results, it makes me feel like I have Factitious Disorder. I recognize I also have psychiatric issues though, which may have physical manifestations. \n* OSA: This has been my personal working diagnosis for a long time. I can become partially obstructed without even falling asleep all the way. I didn\'t fall asleep at the home sleep study, but I also didn\'t have obstructive symptoms at the 2 hospital sleep studies. I can\'t be prescribed a CPAP without an official diagnosis. \n* Venous Insufficiency: one vein bulging out, but placing legs to ceiling REALLY helps. I\'ve also been wearing compression socks for years without knowing they had an effect besides pain relief. \n\nDifferential Diagnoses\n\n* Fibromyalgia: possible but rare for a male in his 20s\n* Rheumatologic disease: \n   * Ankylosing spondylitis- achilles enthesitis, inflexible lower back, pain persists with rest and at night\n   * Rheumatoid Arthritis\n*  Myopathy - sensation of muscle wkness but 5/5 strength\n* Ehlers Danlos: The only symptoms I have are bendy fingers and chronic pain, but idk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see my PCP and sleep doctor soon.

Turns out Im deficient in Vitamin D which can cause bone/ joint pain! Makes sense to be deficient since the Accutane required me to cover up/stay out of the sun and then entering winter as I finished my course. Im taking a LOT of vit D to bring my levels up to adequate/ optimal but after only a week of taking it Im already noticing a substantial improvement!

You want to manage your fever but not suppress itfevers are what stops viruses from multiplying in your body, symptoms become worse as viral load increases. \n\nIf you have a cough, a humidifier or a shower may help ease it as humid air is easier on your lungs. Gargle salt water for a sore throat, and honey to soothe. \n\nIf you live in the northern hemisphere, you may be vitamin D deficient due to lack of sun and low levels of UVB light over winter.

And then in the morning once my mom got to my room in the hospital, they told her what all happened the night prior, and listed what they gave me, then the nurse said morphine, and my mom gave a look of absolute terror, I thought because emergency rooms are for emergencys so they must have known it was a emergency, but now telling people about it, most people think its not right.

It was after eating a fatty meal for dinner. I felt uncomfortable for the next day but it went away. I had been able to eat chick fil a and pizza and other greasy foods after that with no pain, but then it came back when I ate popcorn at the movies, this time it was more of a dull pain in the ruq. Lasted for a bit then went away, then kept coming back. I'm now having it with most of my meals even if they're not extremely greasy or processed. The location has changed a lot since then as well. It goes from right under the breast over the ribs, to directly on the side and back in line with this location, never really goes toward the middle of the back it's more on the side.\nSometimes it hurts a bit right where the gallbladder is, sometimes it feels like flank pain, sometimes I hurts both over by the ribs as well as right above the hip area on the side and a bit toward the abdomen and lower abdomen but not quite? I've felt the pain when fasting as well but mostly after I eat is when it gets worse. I've gone to the ER twice now. Had blood tests, urine tests, ultrasound, and ct scan ALL normal. The ct scan only showed Trace free fluid in the cul-de-sac in the intraperitoneal space.\nNo stones in the gallbladder no stones in my kidneys.\nBlood test showed elevated MCV (95.3), MCH (31.2), and MPV (11.2) which everyone has said is normal. GI doctor reluctantly gave me an order for a HIDA scan that l'm getting done on Wednesday, but he says he strongly disbelieves it's my gallbladder. I've been checked by palpation multiple times and I've never expressed or felt pain when they press on my gallbladder. Ive been told it's gastritis, or even muscular pain. I've been given PPIs, dicyclomine, methocarbamol, toradol at the hospital, the pain seems to calm down but nothing really gets rid of it altogether except for the toradol, but the toradol relief only lasted a day. I'm hoping the HIDA scan will reveal what's wrong but is there something I'm missing, maybe some other tests I should consider? No one seems to know what to do with me. \nThanks in advance.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention I also have endometriosis according to my obgyn and also fixed some typos"""

This is probably the best advice that I wont be able to take.\n\nVestibular migraines were suspiciously absent from the suggestions but based on the medication history I gave you maybe it was right to skip over them. Plenty of these meds should have helped if that was the problem. Still, 1 person suggest I go read at their sub and I will!\n\nAccidents have been mentioned a few times. As for being rear ended twice, once at full speed, you saw my neck mri results  my doctors dont think its that. As for the eye injury my neurologist is trying to get my insurance to pay for a Scleral lens to compensate for the corneal scar as we speak.\n\nCraniocervical Instability was mentioned and I definitely want to be tested for that. Looks like Ive got to do a stand up MRI. IT SHALL BE DONE as soon as my insurance agrees to pay.\n\nThebackright mentions chronic cervicogenic headaches and I have to agree I see the similarities. The way its always happening, it doesnt come and go. And the way it hurts but it doesnt pulse or throb. I definitely need to check this better.\n\nA physician suggested SPG block while noting its probably not going to be my magic cure-all but its low risk, convenient, it can help some, and Im kind of down to just trying things. I agree with all those points. It will be having this done.\n\nC4theruned came in hot. It seems I will eventually have to try amytriptiline 20mg even though I dont want to. And My doctor feels Occipital neuralgia has been disproven by a C2:C3 medial branch block but I do not. Not sure how Im going to handle this. Its the same doctor that will not re-order another round of trigger point injections because it only helped 2 hours the first time. \n\nSuggs41 I dont know how to summarize what you said but send me a DM about how to diagnose weak muscles or a link to a video to copy exercises please. Especially since you say proper form is critical. I need more to go on.

Doesnt high PTH mean you already have too much calcium? This post was a head scratcher for me but if I can make sense of it Ill try it. Jaw stretching helps me too but only on the mild headaches. I assume those are tension headaches. They dont help my bad ones. I think the way you do it over your head is stretching your neck muscles too. That might be helping.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n========================back to original post===============\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts so debilitating I couldn\'t even be a landlord any more.  I had to sell my houses.  It has ruined my life. Thats the easiest job on earth, its not even a job. **My pain is inline with the top of my upper lip, just under my nose except its in the back.  Thats my brainstem, right?**  It feels like its being squeezed. But squeezed evenly.  Its not a pulsing or a throbbing.\n\nWhy are anticholinergics & propranolol the only things that help my headaches? **Does that indicate what kind of headache I\'m having**?\n\nNon-stop headaches 24/7. Laying on my side and tilting my head back is the only thing I can do to help besides take pills.  Triptans dont help at all. Sometimes when its really bad more than just that 1 spot hurts, the entire brain hurts (except behind the eyes) but the pain is not spread out evenly. The back definitely hurts a lot more. The top half of my forehead is just a ""tightness"" in comparison. If I take Wellbutrin it severely intensifies the pain in the top half of my neck, brain stem, cerebellum, maybe occipital area too. It literally felt like it was getting crushed. I never have pulsing/throbbing pains. Replaced the Wellbutrin with Strattera and it doesn\'t hurt nearly as much but it does still hurt and I need something for my ADHD. I\'ve always got car sick. If I tried to read a book I\'ll be sick for hours after reading 1 page. I\'ve always got bad headaches if I work under something looking upward (like someone working under a car). If I\'m on my hands and knees and rotate my head to look left or right I\'m going to get a headache and feel sick but I never throw up. I feel like my headaches and this ""sickness"" that never leads to throwing up overlap most of the time.\n\nIt is made much worse by SSRI. **SSRI cannot be tolerated without Cyproheptadine**. I believe I am serotonin hyper-sensitive. Without Cyproheptadine I cannot take SSRI, SNRI, Benzos, or the Tricyclic I tried for a few days (yea that was my worst effort, sorry). I though it was a vestibular issue but I passed the Caloric Stimulation test (pure torture btw, one of the worst days of my life) and I never have to deal with a spinning sensation unless i bounce out of bed or I\'m in the dark.  Its practically nothing. I don\'t get dizzy more than twice a year and I think that is only in a pitch black room. Motion makes it much worse. I have tinnitus. Tilting my head a lot reduces the pain. Its never 1 hemisphere of my brain. I have no idea please help.\n\nHead MRI looks good.\n\nNeck MRI shows minor problems that docs say shouldn\'t be causing this but here they are:\n\n1. Straightening of cervical lordosis.\n2. Multilevel mild degenerative disc disease changes at C3-C7 with multilevel mild canal stenosis. There is no disc protrusion or cord compression.\n3. Mild diffuse facet degenerative changes as described.\n\nThe consistency and evenness of pain (no throbbing) made me think cervicogenic headache.  But the location seems to indicate migraine. And I don\'t know where the motion sickness headaches fit in.  Maybe thats just a separate issue.\n\n***EVERYTHING THAT HELPS IS ANTICHOLINERGIC OR PROPRANOLOL:***\n\nCyproheptadine - helps headache and allows me to take serotonergic meds  \nMeclizine - might not be helping the same head issues as the other 5  \nBenadryl  \nDoxylamine  \nKlonopin  \nPropranolol\n\nThe Cyproheptadine causes my serotonin meds to work less well.\n\nThe Propranolol crushes the effectiveness of my norepinephrine meds.\n\nI have to take all of that to not have a headache. I can\'t keep taking 5 anticholinergics. Its making me eat non-stop, I\'m lazy, I cant remember anything, and I\'m going to get dementia/Parkinsons/Alzheimers. I have to figure out whats wrong with me and find a better way to treat it.\n\n***MEDS THAT DIDN\'T HELP:***  \nPercocet  \nTramadol  \nFioricet  \nEmgality - 4 months - still cant tell  \nQulipta  \nAmlodipine  \nRizatriptan  \nSumatriptan  \nPepcid AC  \nZyrtec  \nMagnesium  \nAdvil, Tylenol, Meloxicam, caffeine - didn\'t help but gave me rebound headaches\n\nTENS machine didn\'t help\n\n**Trigger Point Injection day was frigging awesome. For 2 hours I felt like a normal person.** They said the fact that it was only 2 hours meant it failed. They said I had to be responding to the numbing medicine and not the real medicine they shot in there. (its worth mentioning that I always felt amazing after the pain of laser hair removal the rest of the day. That had to be endorphins, right? So I guess this could have been endorphins too but it only lasted 2 hours, not the rest of the day so i doubt it). **When I got trigger point injections i got 4 up the left side of my neck up to the base of my skull and 4 injections up the right side straight across from the other 4.**\n\nMedial Branch Block was so painful I have no idea how I would know if it helped. The pain from their injection lasted 6 hours but the medicine they shot in there only lasts 2 hours according to them. So how would I know if it worked? But My guess would be this is way too low down my neck and not the problem.\n\n***MAYBES OR  CONFLICTS:***\n\nTizanidine - Seemed to help at first but I was taking Wellbutrin back then. Has not helped since I quit the Wellbutrin so I\'d guess the Wellbutrin was creating tension headaches.\n\nBotox - Seemed to help at first and allowed me to take much less Tizanidine (from 8mg a day to 2mg) but I was taking Wellbutrin back then. I never go more than 3 months to let it all expire so I can\'t be sure if its helping now or not. I think its helping tensions headaches, not migraines.\n\nPregabalin - Helped by the smallest amount anything ever helped by. No where near worth the side effects. I\'m really unimpressed with this medication.\n\nTheophylline - makes me feel a little weird, hard to tell but if it helps its only a very small amount.\n\nHydroxyzine - is the only anticholinergic I tried that didn\'t help my headaches and I am guessing thats because it increases serotonin and it was before I was on Cyproheptadine.\n\nI\'ve never been tested for Autism but I\'m probably on the spectrum. My dad wouldn\'t get tested and he\'s 5 times weirder than me so I felt like I never had the option. I mention this because it has been said autistic people experience pain differently and I think they are putting it kindly... When I had laser hair removal they said I was the biggest baby they ever treated. So I want you to know the way I describe these pains might seem off to you normal people.'"

antimicrobial rash,https://www.reddit.com/r/DermatologyQuestions/comments/jodtkx/athletes_foot_toenail_fungus/,"b""Athlete's Foot / Toenail Fungus""",,"b""Hi all, I've been lurking this and other threads on this issue for a while now, but figure the time has come for me to make my own post.\n\nOver the last two years or so, I noticed a fungal infection in my right big toenail, which consequently, spread to my other toes on that foot, and eventually to my left big toe as well. \n\nAbout a month and a half ago, I contracted a bad case of athlete's foot. Upon realizing that, I tried...eh, just a few things: Lotrimin cream, Odor Eaters spray, coconut oil with tea tree and cinnamon essential oil, Aquaphor, Gold Bond powder and spray, Neosporin, Vinegar foot soaks, Epsom salts, Ozonated sunflower oil, drying feet with hair dryer after showering, sterilizing shoes with UV, washing laundry in hot water with vinegar/laundry sanitizer and applying urea to problem areas occasionally for the antifungals to work their magic. Some of these I am still doing/using.\n\nI had been prescribed Penlac, but broke out in a weird face rash a day or two into using it and perhaps irrationally, attributed it to the Rx and ceased treatment. (I have since had another dry, scaly breakout on my face, so I think there may be another trigger somewhere else). \n\nTrimming the big right toe incorrectly led to an ingrown toenail, so I was also prescribed Mupirocin to deal with any potential bacteria infection. I apply this sporadically.\n\nJust over three weeks ago, I started taking oral terbinafine and have seen some improvement in a few nails and, admittedly, a little in the athlete's foot. It is less inflamed most of the time and the swelling is gone, but whereas it started on just the tops of my toes, it has now evolved to affect the bottoms of them, as well as the sole of my foot, in between a few toes AND the top of my foot. It itches like mad, especially at night. I have taken Claritin here and there, and especially when I had the face rash, to help me sleep, but I'd rather find a more permanent solution.\n\nLately I've been applying O'Keeffe's Healthy Feet and Absorbine Jr Plus to it (the latter of which I'm surprised to not see more mention of here; I found people who swore by it for their AF on other sites). It's too soon to tell if it's working though, which now leads me to my questions.\n\n1. I've switched to merino wool socks, as I've seen differing opinions on cotton and polyester online. Which is best? Merino is expensive and with COVID, well... Money's tight. Assuming I wouldn't have to eventually throw them away (if using hot water and vinegar in my washing machine), I could probably afford to purchase more though.\n\n2. What about my shoes? I currently switch between a pair of Vans and Blundstone boots. Again, I'm using a SteriShoe on them and swapping them out daily, but could they be too far gone? If so, what are some good recommendations for breathable, possibly even antimicrobial shoes and/or sandals that cover unsightly feet but still allow airflow? Any materials I should look for and/or avoid when shopping?\n\n3. How does one go about cleaning with AF? My apartment is sadly carpeted (just researched, priced out and asked landlord for laminate - no go) and while we're getting the floors professionally cleaned in a week or so, I'm afraid of recontamination. I don't want to wear shoes indoors all the time, but am embarrassed and don't want to wear flip flops around my roommate just yet. Would socks be okay?\n\n4. Should I reconsider using the Penlac? The doc who prescribed the Mupirocin said topicals for the AF were likely useless at this point, but I've read to continue using something for nail fungus in conjunction with the oral Rx. \n\n5. I plan on completing the full course (12 weeks) of the terbinafine and just hope it's not extended by the end of all this. I also understand the nail fungus is tough to treat... but how long should I expect to wait to see full results of the athlete's foot? It's been my understanding after some research that it should clear up fairly quickly with such a strong antifungal, if not be totally gone by now. If it's a matter of good things coming to those who wait, what can I use for the itching in the meantime, at the very least?\n\n6. Could it be candida-related? Due to poor circulation? Does keto really help? (I've seen claims.) What other physiological underlying problems could be causing this?\n\n\nIt's becoming such a pain and strain, specifically on my mental health and my relationship. I've been choosing not to stay nights with my boyfriend, as not only is it such an ugly thing, but a contagious one, and the itching at night is unbearable.\n\nAny help you can give would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading."""

I have sought medical help from my local doctor but I don\'t think they or I understand what is going on.\n\nI am a 20 y/o male. I have suffered from depression for about a year and its effects have been intermittent. I received CBT counselling and have not been prescribed antidepressants or other medication for it, and I wished to avoid this if possible due to the well-known side-effects of medication itself and the consequences of coming off ADs for some users. \n\nI am a British national and lived in the United States for four months of this year. After becoming ill with a foot infection, I was seen by an ER doctor and prescribed Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim (Bactrim) and Cephalexin to take for ten days. This was on December 19th. I returned home to the UK on December 21st; my physical condition had deteriorated to include chest infection symptoms and extreme tiredness. On December 25th, I began experiencing hallucinatory delusions after Christmas dinner which lasted until December 27th, when I broke down and told my parents about my previous experience of depression and concealment of it from them. The hallucinations had been religious in nature (I had been an atheist for several years and never attended church but felt sudden guilt for not attending religious services and extreme fear of God\'s judgement). Spilling everything out to my parents felt cathartic to some extent and my condition improved. I stopped taking the antibiotics and my parents found online that possible side effects of them included hallucinations and depression. Since I stopped taking the pills, I have not experienced the religious hallucinations or persistent blanketing fear and exhaustion that came with them.\n\nHowever, I am extremely concerned that I am experiencing more than the side-effects of disagreeable medicine. On the morning of December 28th I was appointed to see my local doctor and felt mostly fine during the day. On the night of December 28th I was struck by physical sickness and mental instability; I felt like my brain was fracturing off into different tangents and I had lost control of my thoughts. I was sobbing and crying for over an hour while my mind felt completely disordered. I considered I might be having a panic attack, but having previously experienced one during a depressive phase in February, this episode felt different. I was troubled most by the sensation that I could not control my thoughts and the worry about what was going to happen to me in the long-term. Fear of fear itself - I did not want to end up being hospitalized or end up what in the UK is known as a \'basket case\'. I kept thinking I was going to end up living at home for the rest of my life, cared for by my parents and not being able to fulfill my life plans. The worst aspect of it was that whenever I thought of one person in particular, \'X\', a very close female friend, I felt that my mind was dividing into positive and negative compartments about them. Precisely because I had an intense desire to avoid feeling negatively towards them, I was being made to feel such. I kept telling my mother who was with me during the episode that ""I don\'t want to hurt X"" even though I did not experience any tangible feelings of aggression towards them. \n\nMy doctor had given me on the morning of December 28th a patient questionnaire to fill in and return next week, but I feel most of the questions pertain to depression and do not cover what I was experiencing last night. I feel fine at present and will probably have a \'good\' day, but I am terrified of the same thing happening again tonight. I\'ve avoided reading up on my symptoms as self-diagnosis is a whirlwind of problems in itself.

My eight year old daughter was recently diagnosed after a couple of assessments.  The psych spoke with her for 10 minutes and noticed most of the classic childhood ADHD behaviors.  He followed that up by having 3 people fill out a questionnaire on her behavior.  Us, plus we gave it to her current (3rd grade) and 2nd grade teacher.  \n\nShe\'s an otherwise super happy, super smart kid.  As time has passed though, she\'s shown more and more signs of difficulty paying attention, so my wife and I thought this was coming.  She was super resistant to meds at first, but eventually agreed to take them, which struck me as odd.\n\nI have an undergrad psych degree and no problem with administering prescribed meds as directed by a licensed physician, but my mom though.  She\'s become more and more of a crunchy granola type as she\'s gotten older.  She\'s always been pretty anti psychoactive meds/pharma (except the meds she likes/uses like Advil, Tramadol, and a handful of others ... consistency is not her strong suit).  She also loves my kids like crazy and sees them most weekends so my wife and I can get a date night in.  I can\'t stress enough how sweet and loving she is though.  She\'s really the archetypal grandma in many ways right down to baking and spoiling them.\n\nAnyway, I talked with her on the phone about my kid\'s diagnosis and she got all sad and started talking about zombie kids and how she was disappointed.  That one I pushed back on.  ""Disappointed in what, mom?"" I asked her.  And I told her that if she wants to watch the kids, she needs to give her meds as prescribed, full stop.  Anyway she continued to be all sad and morose at me telling me that my daughter\'s behavior wasn\'t so bad but like ... people, it\'s pretty clear if you watch her.  Eventually my daughter mentioned that her negative attitude toward meds may have come from her grandmother.\n\nAnyway, I\'m feeling super anxious right now and worried for my girl.  I love her so damn much, and I just want her to be able to be okay in school and able to focus.  Have any of you had positive experiences with meds in grade school? Am I doing the right thing?\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nEdit: Hey all, just wanted to express my gratitude for how many of you have taken the time to share.  It\'s been a big help.'"
NSAID swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/14pq1c/so_someone_on_facebook_wanted_some_adderall/,b'So someone on facebook wanted some Adderall',,"b'Someone, on a college facebook group page mind you, post that he wanted some Adderall.  I told him not to abuse medicine needed by others.  He said need is simply perception.  Here is my response.\n\nADHD is just as real as pain, both on a perceptual and a chemical level.  Every person diagnosed with ADHD has a different perception and tolerance level, much the same as everyone suffering from pain has a different perception and tolerance to the pain they are experiencing.  \n\nPain is caused by prostaglandins, the chemical responsible for both swelling and signaling to the brain that there is something wrong.  NSAIDs, the most popular category of OTC pain killers, stop pain and swelling by limiting the effect that prostaglandins have on the body.  Opiates act on several bases to alleviate pain.  They primarily act upon the Mu receptors, reducing the flow of painful stimulants.  They also act upon the limbic pathways, reducing the emotional response to pain.\n\nADHD is caused by a lack of neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) in the brain.  The brain of a person with ADHD is always in a constant state of desire for these neurotransmitters, exhibited by restlessness and distraction.  These constant external stimuli stimulate the brain to release a small amount of these neurotransmitters.  When one takes a stimulant (amphetamine, methylphenidate, cocaine, etc.), the brain either releases these neurotransmitters or blocks their reuptake, or both.  The more is taken, the more neurotransmitters are released.  When one with ADHD takes a stimulant, their levels of neurotransmitters rise to a level in which the brain is no longer in need of an external stimuli.  This allows for the person to function as a normal person.\n\n\nI won, though, sadly, he deleted his post.'"

If you\'re young, athletic and motivated like me, it really takes a toll on you. \n\nI know exactly how HORRIBLE this feels and this is why I\'m writing this. \n\nIf a single person reads my success story and feels a bit better, then I will be happy. \n\n**This is not medical advice**. \n\nI will describe my own experience in length, what worked and what didn\'t, but I am not a doctor. Beware: Back pain and sciatica are large industries. There are NUMEROUS vultures willing to suck your wallet dry while wasting your time with treatments that do you no good, or worse, cause you harm. It is highly likely that you will be required to dodge a number of such bullshit-fused bullets before you\'re completely healed. \n\nYeap. I said it. Completely healed. You WILL be completely healed.\n\nI did, and you will too. \n\n**Here\'s my story:**\n\nAugust 3rd, 2017 I injured my back deadlifting on the gym. I was pretty strong, back then, and I felt like I was Superman. I had been dealing with minor lower-back injuries - many family members do - since middle-school, so I didn\'t sweat it. \n\nI was back in the gym two days later trying to push through the pain and working out as normal.\n\n**Lesson 1:** \n\nDon\'t be dumb, like I was. If you\'re injured, let it heal. \n\nI am pretty confident that THIS was the day I fucked up my spine, and not the day I deadlifted. This has been confirmed by a physical therapist and two orthopedics. \n\n**I repeat: If you\'re injured, let it heal. Listen to your body.** \n\nSo, my lower back balooned with inflammation. After four days or so, my left leg started going numb. Numbness quickly devolved to pain. EXCRUCIATING pain. The type of pain that turns Superman to a crying, malnourished, lost 9-year old girl. The type of pain that haunts you for months after. \n\nI was literally carried to the Emergency Department of a hospital, where they prescribed me Arcoxia & Norgesic (potent anti-inflammatory and muscle-relaxant/painkiller respectively). \n\n**I passed out at 11 am next morning. Didn\'t sleep a minute through that first night.** \n\nFast forward a few days, a neurosurgeon I was sent to pointed out I had: \n\n*  Significant muscle weakness on my lower leg. \n\n*  Loss of sensation to a big portion of my foot.\n\n* The usual neurological suspects: Tingling, needless, cramps and the like. \n\nHe told me I\'d probably need surgery or I\'d risk permanent damage, and he prescribed me an MRI. \n\nThe MRI showed I had 2 two minor disc herniations and a third one, which had f***ing exploded. A big portion of disc ""gel"" had been ruptured off and was fixed on pressing my sciatic nerve. \n\nI was given methylprednisolone (corticosteroid) and told I should have surgery soon because that would NOT heal through conservative treatment - to do otherwise would risk permanent damage. \n\n**Well, let me tell you, this was inaccurate. I healed.** \n\nI decided not to undergo surgery after fact-gathering and lengthy personal research. I learned three things:\n\n*  Over the long-term patients that have been operated on and those who opted for conservative treatment have, on average, the same level of healing. \n\n* Huge disc injuries, like mine, were FULLY capable of resolving themselves much like the smaller ones. This is called disc-resorption, for anyone that is interested. \n\n* Each spinal surgery increases the risk of future surgeries. Given my age, I was pretty much guaranteed to have fusion surgery down the road - which is not really on my menu. \n\n**So, what did I do?**\n\nI visited NUMEROUS other doctors and health experts. Now, I have to be honest with you. I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the health-care industry. 9 out of 10 people don\'t give a shit about your health. \n\nI will give you three examples that highlight my horrendous experience: \n\n1.  A physical therapist I visited accidentally re-injured me with his elbow during manual therapy. He told me that it was somehow my fault, and he had nothing to do with it. I was in bed for around 2 weeks due to this.\n\n2.  An orthopedic told me I should get vitamin B-complex injections. These are supposed to help with nerve damage repair. Well, they only work if you\'re deficient. I was not. In fact, after getting blood work done, I saw I was above-limit. \n\n3.  A quack told me I should do his few, magic ""healing stretches"" that would ""re-align"" my life. Needless to say, mere stretching was not the answer - I will get into that later - and his stretches had nothing unique about them. \n\nI am getting carried away. \n\nSo, after spending MONTHS pursuing shitty hit-and-miss treatments, this is what actually worked for me:\n\n**From pain-management to functionality:**\n\n**1. Walking:** I set a goal to walk 5 miles per day. At first, walking was limited inside my home but I slowly built on it, dilligently. \n\n**2. Sciatic nerve gliding:** Youtube that shit. There is not strong medical evidence, but it helped me. It might help you. \n\n**3. McGills Big 3:** Google them up. I know enough about fitness to understand how to intelligently progress these into harder versions. I would slowly increase difficulty every third day. \n\n**4. Vitamin C & D:** 2000 MG & 3000 UV daily respectively. Might have been placebo. I saw a few studies claiming these help, they were cheap, so I tried them. \n\n(*Only after significant discomfort had passed*):\n\n**5. Daily stretching:** I stretched my calfs, my soleus (look it up), my hamstrings (bent leg), my quads (important), my glutes (piriformis too), my hip flexors. I would also do the McKenzie spinal stretch. \n\n**6. Strengthening all the aforementioned muscles.** LIGHT exercise - all following well-structured protocols. I found the site sportsinjuryclinic a great resource in this. I found treatment protocols for EACH problem-area I had and followed them like a zealot - e.g, achiles tendon rehab, hamstring sprain rehab etc. Of special importance, I found, was strengthening the gluteus medius muscle - google up the exercise ""clams"". \n\n**7. Progressing to harder core exercises.** Ab wheel, leg raises on the pull-up bar. Being more active - i.d, more walking, light upper body work. \n\n**Now, let me share the things that f*d me up:**\n\n**1. Pressure on my nerve.** Whether it was manual therapy, tight jeans, sitting on an uncomfortable chair, too much exercise, streching too much, my foam roller - or, in cases where I was really vulnerable, merely walking - this lead to complications. I\'d usually start going numb and hurting. DON\'T overdo it, whatever it is you are doing.\n\n**2. Cold.** It\'s pretty cold where I live. I\'ve noticed this to have a significant effect on my sciatic symptoms. Try and stay warm, whenever you can. \n\n**3. Too much medicine.** Did nothing, or worse, it masked my condition by covering the symptoms. This lead me to overestimate my health and complicated the situation numerous times. Use it when you need it. \n\n**4. Laying on bed.** I\'ve experienced SIGNIFICANT muscle atrophy on my legs throughout this journey. I attribute this to the fact that I spent too much time laying in bed, during periods of great fear and discomfort. Fear is your biggest enemy in this, I swear. Stay as active as possible without hurting yourself. This is a fine line, but you can find it if you go looking for it. \n\n**5. Dr. Sarno\'s preachings** - and any other feel-good goofy mental treatment. Now, I am a logical person by nature. This might work better for you if you\'re emotional, but I wouldn\'t bet on it. Although I imagine there is a psychosomatic component in this, trying to address this mentally did not work for me. If anything, it got me overthinking and paranoid. \n\n**6. Overexerting myself.** For a length of time, I tried to keep working on full capacity as best as I could. This stressed me in ways that you can not imagine. You need to realize that for a few months you\'ll be in a healing phase. For good or worse, you need to minimize your responsibilities. This is especially important if you\'re a workaholic. \n\n------------\n\n**The million-dollar question: How do I feel now?**\n\nI had a second MRI recently. \n\nMy ""exploded"" disc gel has been diminished, no longer applying pressure to my spine. \n\nI can work. I can have sex. I can go for a walk without being afraid. I am not yet confident I can weightlift heavy or throw my girlfriend around, but I am confident that I soon will.\n\nOh. And since I mentioned my girlfriend, let me say this because it NEEDS to be stated:\n\n**During your healing phase, surround yourself with people who love you.**\n\nI can\'t stress how valuable my girlfriend\'s presence through all this was.\n\nI am convinced I would had grown crazy without her. \n\nAnyway.\n\nThat was my story. Excuse me if the text is too long, or somewhat incoherent - it really shouldn\'t, because I am a copywriter. \n\nThe point I\'m trying to get across is simple:\n\nIf my dumb ass managed to heal, then you can too. I promise you. There\'s hope.\n\n**Stay strong, brothers and sisters.**\n\nBest wishes,\n\nItchesForRiches\n\n\n'"

I only have 4 pills left from the prescription and it's still red and painful. I'm anxious about the antibiotics not working. GP is not very concerned, though.""",,"b""So, I've had this sebaceous cyst on my left arm for about 15 years. It was supposed to be excised last March 2020 but the pandemic happened, then my surgeon died, and then I developed agoraphobia. I've had GAD, GERD, and IBS since 2012 but it got worse during the lockdown. I'm currently seeing a psychologist for it. No other notable history, but I've had recurring boils from 2008-2009 and then 2016-2019, and then 2022-2023. During 2016-2019, it was always treated with antibiotics. Had a full workup done and all the numbers were normal. Haven't had new tests since 2020, though, due to my agoraphobia. I'm having trouble leaving my house and I only feel safe when I'm in areas I'm familiar with (car, grocery, a cafe)\n\nMy current issue is this infected sebaceous cyst. I've been trying to make lifestyle changes, which started in March, by going to a nutritionist, following a diet plan, and doing workouts. On March 16, originally thought that my arm was sore due to working out but then concluded that it was the area around the cyst that was tender.\n\nMarch 17: I had a tele-consult with a dermatologist and she told me that it's normal that the cyst and the area around it feel tender since it's a bit big (approx. 2cm across). She advised me to apply .005% Tretinoin cream on it to help it along.\n\nMarch 18: I had a tele-consult with my family doctor who has seen my cyst before it was infected, and we had a video call and I showed her photos. I was prescribed Clindamycin 300mg 3x a day.\n\nI'm attaching progress photos here: [https://imgur.com/a/iurf7RO](https://imgur.com/a/iurf7RO)\n\nI was also advised to go to a surgeon once the swelling goes down. I consulted with my PCP again yesterday since I was panicking and felt like I need to go to the Emergency Department. She told me to wait until my appointment with the surgeon on Tuesday (March 28). I'm supposed to consult with her again tomorrow to see if I need to extend my antibiotics.\n\nRight now, the swollen/hard part kind around the cyst has kind of gone down already but it still hurts when pressure is applied to the area. I guess I'm just panicking and imagining worst-case scenarios. Before the pandemic, I was a professional violinist, and now I'm a painter and writer and I'm really scared about losing my arm. I'd really like a second opinion or some reassurance, please. I don't know what to do, and I feel so stuck since I'm still unable to function normally.  \n\n\nLocation: Philippines"""
corticosteroid problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/ddmzrk/put_me_out_of_my_misery/,b'Put me out of my misery!',,"b""NOTE: IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ THE WHOLE THING SKIP TO 3. ONWARDS\n1. THE LEAD UP:\nMy sciatica story started all the way back around December 2018. It was the end of high school (my age was 17 years 10 months) and I wanted to focus on my deadlifting. I had been deadlifting since mid 2017 and could do upto 120kgs for 3 reps no problem by around June 2018. Due to all the work during my final year of high school I went from doing deadlifts roughly twice a week to around once every 2 weeks lifting at 120 kgs max. I suspect that my form was slowly getting poorer over time as I kept overlooking my flaws in lifting technique.\n\nEarly December 2018, school was done and I increases my lifting frequency to twice a week (still doing 120kgs 3 reps per set). When I started increasing the weight to 125kgs I kept dropping the barbell onto the floor (after say 2 reps) due to sweaty hands and poor grip stength. So I asked my father to buy some straps so I could grip the barbell better. \n\nI didn't try and progress through some lighter weights with the straps and went straight to 125kgs. The straps were a but loose and on the 3rd rep I dropped the barbell but alas, the straps were in the way causing me to bend forward and put the barbell down. Me being an egoistic fool, I went for another rep to see if I could improve my form but the same thing happened and a sharp pain happened in the middle of my lower back.\n\nThe pain was intense during while doing things such as bending from that day on. It calmed down after a few weeks and eventually went away (or so I thought). I started deadlifting again (January 2018) with lower weights (50 kgs) and worked on improving my form. The pain was still there but not as bad. I slowly increased the weights and by the time I went to 100kgs the pain came back and it was worse than before.\n\nSneezing (the worst), sudden movements, bending forward and occasionally coughing would make a mild and constant back pain become a agonizing misery. It was as if the left side of my lower back was collapsing on itself. I went to the physio (probably March) and he said something along the lines of a tight muscle was trying to protect the joints in my spine. He did some massaging and within hours my back pain was gone.\n\n2. THE SCIATICA AND CORTISTEROID:\nAfter a few days of my pain being gone, I noticed that when walking that there would be a mild pain down the back of my leg. Nothing too bothersome at this point and it didn't affect my lifestyle much. Within 3 days it became worse. The pain would happen while transitioning from standing to sitting or from sitting to standing (this was far more painful). The pain would run down the back of my leg and occasionally into the back of my heel. \n\nAfter 2 weeks I went back to the physio and the physio deemed it something along the lines of hamstring tendonopothy and that I should sit on pillows or stand for a week. I did so and went back to him and he said that my nerve was sensitive. He gave me a few excercises to deal with the nerve sensitivity. My father wanted a second opinion. \n\nWe went to a GP and he asked us to do an ultrasound to check for inflammation. Turns out there was some ischiogluteal bursitis according to the doctor when he checked the ultrasound. He recommended me to a different physio and suggested getting a corticosteroid injection with the help of ultrasound. \n\nWhen getting the cortisteroid injection, ultrasound wasn't used however and I was simply asked where the pain was. It was difficult to pinpoint the pain so I pointed to where the pain was the most at that moment. A week later, no improvement at all. I was also taking some anti-inflammatory pills that my GP prescribed but to no results.\n\n3. THE PHYSIO:\nThe new physio told me that my nerve was sensitive and asked me to start moving daily. After the injury began I hadn't exercised at all. He wanted me to start walking and doing things like using the elliptical I had at home. I did so for a week and I noticed that my pain would mildly reduce during the day. However the next day it would reset.\n\nMornings are the worst. The moment I get out of the bed, the pain in my leg is pure agony. Standing hurts and moving hurts as well. It calms down within an hour. I explained this to the physio. He asked me to continue with my exercises and taught me a nerve stretching exercise to do after my regular exercises. Our next appointment is next week. The time between the second visit and my next visit is 3 weeks so there's been some for me to focus on walking, using the elliptical and doing what the physio has instructed.\n\nI slowly increased my 20 minute walks to 40 minute walks. My elliptical from 10 minutes to 40 minutes. The pain calms down the most during the evenings due to the excercises. It's still there. Not mild, not agonizing like the morning pains, but reduced pain. Recently I started doing some type of pushups which requires me to lie down (back up) but to no results. Nowadays I am either standing up or lying face down on my bed.\n\nToday while I was on the toilet seat I noticed that I had very little pain (possibly none at all) which was weird since sitting hurts my sciatica. The moment I stood up, I felt a pain far more painful than ever before. I would prefer my morning pains over this. It felt like the nerve moved (it's what it felt like, hopefully not what happened). Even 2 hours later as I write this on my bed lying belly down, the pain is there when i move my leg in certain positions. Wherever and whenever I felt my sciatic pains, it has become sharper and more agonizing.\n\n4. THE POINT:\nI am not sure what to do. Lying belly down is the best position I can be in due to it causing the least amount of pain but I am a University student who is behind by weeks simply due to not being able to attend many of my classes (sitting hurts). I can not lie down forever, and the pain has decreased my overall happiness (what's left of it). My parents are extremely busy and stressed  but support me when they can but most of the day they are at work.\n\nThis pain is the worst, it's not like any other pain. No scream, yell, grunt helps ease the pain. The pain can be suffocating sometimes as I have to catch my breath when the pain gets really bad. While I am thankful for my sciatica teaching me a lesson in humility for weightlifting, the pain has gone for far too long. \n\nI don't know how long I can deal with this pain. My strength is slowly fading and so I ask this subreddit if you have any advice on how I should proceed or anything that might be useful. There's been no official diagnosis yet but my guess is that this might be due to a herniated disk or a ruptured disk."""

I'd like to approach my PCP and tell him that I've been taking the medication without it being prescribed and express interest in being prescribed it as it seems to be working. I realize that there will likely be some proclivity on my PCP's part to prescribe a medication I've been taking without a prescription, so how would be the best way to broach this? Is it a crime to possess/use this medication without a prescription (it is not a controlled substance, FWIW)? Would most doctors be hesitant to prescribe this medication if a PT had been taking it without a prescription? Could I face any potential legal trouble by telling my doctor this?

Usually I\'m the one helping patients navigate and understand this sort of thing, but I am beyond exasperated.\n\n**I have bolded the important parts for the skimmers.**\n\n**I have been having gallbladder attacks since November of last year.**  They increased in frequency and severity until I started taking data in January.  They happened every three months or so, then every month, then near constantly.\n\nIn March it become clear to me that I have gallstones and am experiencing gallbladder attacks.  On March 28th, after an attack that left me on the floor and barely conscious at work, **I started an extreme low-fat diet.**\n\nI have taken enough data to find the following: Without dietary intervention, my attacks are 30-60 minutes long, 8-9 severity, every single day.  \n\nWith intervention, **I have attacks if: I eat more than 20 grams of fat a day, I have more than 10 grams of fat in a sitting, I have a large volume of food at once regardless of what it is, I go more than 12 hours without eating.** The attacks are 10-30 mins long and 6-7 severity. I\'m averaging once a week. I cannot function through them. I have to sit very still and focus on trying to breathe.\n\nThis means **I am currently eating ~1,100 calories, ~15g of fat a day.** I am a 5\'0"" man and was 125 lbs. I am now 112. This is not sustainable. \n\nDespite working in healthcare, I do not have health insurance.  I have had to go through vocational rehabilitation to access any form of care for this.  As grateful as I am that I have *any* options, it is endlessly frustrating.\n\nI had my first appointment after a long wait on May 5. It was with a nurse.  I never saw a doctor.  I value and respect nurses, but his bedside manner is terrible, he interrupted me constantly and he did not seem to take my situation seriously.\n\n**He scheduled an ultrasound, prescribed dicyclomine, and told me to continue my diet.**\n\nThe ultrasound was for July.  I called constantly to check for cancellations and was able to get it **on May 16.  Gallstones were confirmed on ultrasound** (though the majority of people have them anyway).\n\nI have bounced messages back and forth to him via the patient portal and he is saying a HIDA scan may be useful to check my gallbladder function.  I have asked how this could possibly lead to anything but a cholecystectomy. \n\nHe has said that I can take a **conservative route of continuing my diet and taking dicyclomine and ibuprofen to manage symptoms, or I can be sent for a surgical consult in November.**\n\nI have still not spoken to a single doctor.\n\nIbuprofen does absolutely nothing. I only take the dicyclomine if I feel one starting, or if I suspect I have done something that will trigger it.  At best, it simply delays the attack until the next meal.\n\n**My diet is not sustainable.  No human being can be healthy on the amount of fat I am consuming.**  No one over 4\'10"" can survive on the calories I\'m eating.\n\nI am terrified of a surgical outcome, but I cannot see any other option.  Since I am going through vocational rehab for my care, I have very little control over any of this.  I don\'t get to make my own appointments.  I don\'t get to decide who I see or where I go.  I don\'t get to decide what the next steps are or if they are covered.\n\nI feel like I am at the end of what I can endure with no support. **I can\'t make it to November.**'"

Or should I try to go all out and tackle my anxiety to the fullest and try to stop it before it picks up any steam via medicine, therapy, etc? \n\n\nEdit: P.S. I am on Xanax which I was prescribed to use only as needed (0.5mg). I have also only used it twice. Once was to see how it actually affected me, and the second time was because I was going in for a cleaning with my dentist and being at a dentists office has ALWAYS caused me SOME degree of anxiety. With the fact I actually HAVE anxiety now. I didn't want to risk having a panic attack while they were cleaning my teeth. Thus it was kind of a preventative use. \n"""

I had chest pain and dizziness several months ago and went to cardiology  for tests. Stress echo was normal, though the symptoms were still made worse with the exercise. I was sent for a CT scan with contrast. No blockages or abnormalities.  They did find a small hiatal hernia. I asked if that could cause chest pain and they reluctantly admitted that it could. I say reluctantly because despite my results being normal, she wanted to put me on a stronger statin.\n  Ive been on statins for years and it has impaired my glucose tolerance. Rather than go on Metformin, I opted to go on strict low carb diet, monitor my glucose and lots of walking. Ive done that for two years and Im almost back in to anormal A1C. Ive worked *very* hard. I also switched from Simvastatin to Pravastatin. The latter has some preliminary findings suggesting it doesn\'t effect glucose tolerance as strongly. One of the worst statins for this...is Crestor. The cardiac nurse is convinced that I need to be on it. So I tried it for a month and surprise - my glucose is impaired again. (Morning was usually 160 at worst, two days ago it was 300. My diet has not changed.) I said no thanks to the Crestor and asked to be put back on Pravastatin. Nurse was really pushing back saying its still worth the risk because my cholesterol was too high on the Pravastin. I agreed to double my dose of it until we sort out this dispute.\n  I get a call today from the cardiologist resident who was approached by the RN about my refusal to take Crestor.  I get the same spiel about how its worth the risk. I explain patiently that A) I show no signs of heart disease. B)that my chest pain was very likely the hiatal hernia (which will be addressed separately)C) That although I understand their logic, I have worked very hard to keep my Diabetes controlled without Metformin.

I am currently seeing a Neurologist who is running more tests, but I would appreciate any insight as I am desperate. The neurologist hasn\'t communicated a suspected diagnosis as of yet. The headache is significant and impacts my daily life, I have only been able to work part time since (at most 2 days a week). Some photophobia, pain is a constant, stabbing, ache, typically in the forehead/temple/behind eyes area, alternates from side to side depending on the day. Some times are manageable (3/10), others are debilitating (8/10).\n\n36 year old male5\'11"", 270lbVegetarianBritish ancestry, CanadaNon-smoker (never have), 0-2 drinks per week, no recreational drugs, 0.5-1 cup of coffee per dayCurrent meds: Amlodapine, Indapamide, Candisartan, Mirtazipine (all for several years).\n\nPrior medical history:\n\n1. Right nephrectomy 3.0 years ago due to an aquired UPJ stricture - Resulting in my obesity, difficulty recovery.\n   1. Creatinin \\~115, GFR \\~70 - Advised not to take NSAIDS by my nephrologist\n2. History of frequent nephrolithiasis, suffice to say I know a 10 on the pain scale\n3. ""atypical"" asthma (some pulmonary function tests have been normal, others have been slightly abnormal),\n4. idiopathic hypertension since 15 years old, controlled with meds\n5.

L4-L5 Spondylolisthesis\n\nJust over 6 months ago, I woke up with a 6/10 headache and significant ""blurry-ness"" in my left eye. As an optometrist was the easiest and quickest option, that\'s where I went first. The optometrist imaged my retina, performed some in-office tests, and recommended I see my doctor (although everything seemed normal to her).\n\nDue to COVID, I had a phone appointment with my doctor who referred me to an ophthalmologist. It is worth noting, my headache had not (and still has not) subsided.\n\nThe ophthalmologist did a series of tests, and determined that I just ""woke up and realized I needed glasses,"" as everything was normal (minus a red-cap test where colours were less vivid in my left eye) and he assumed my issues were refractory.\n\nAs the headache had not resolved, my family doctor sent me for a head MRI without contrast, which was normal, minus some maxillary sinusitis, which was treated with an antibiotic.\n\nA subsequent head CT a month later was also normal.\n\nApproximately 6 weeks after onset, my vision returned to normal (or at least near normal), and on a follow-up appointment my ophthalmologist was surprised and elated that the vision in my left eye had improved at least 90%. With testing, it is still weaker than my right, but that may have been the case before.\n\nTried 3 different ""migraine"" medications (Rizatriptan RPD, Metoclopramide, Topiramate) with no effect, and a severe reaction to the Maxalt.\n\nAt the direction of my family doc, went to the ER for ""migraine protocol"" - IV dexamethazone, metoclopramide, tordol. -- Headache completely resolved for the first time since onset, however returned that evening (about 8 hours later).\n\nIncidentally, developed a stubborn non-productive cough, my family physician treated with 10 days of prednisone (50mg/day) - By the 10th day my quality of life and pain had improved by at least 80%. That and the IV in the ER have been the only thing that gave me relief.\n\nRecently (past couple of weeks) I have noticed some diminished eyesight in my left eye once more. I have a followup with the ophthalmologist next week so he can check it objectively then.\n\nLast week I had a cervical and thoracic MRI (without contrast out of renal concern), which the initial report says is normal, aside from some ""mild degeneration"" to the thoracic discs. I do have access to the images, so I am attaching some that look concerning to me, however I am no radiologist to say the least.

Such strange sensations feeling the tools scrape against the bone and feel the packing of material.

With that being said, I\'m hoping that I can hear if any of you have had experiences similar to mine and what you did/are doing to cope/treat it. Quite frankly, with this condition that I\'m about to describe, I\'m getting desperate because nobody knows what\'s wrong with me and it seems to be getting worse as time goes on. I\'ve read and tried the things in *Back Mechanic* to no avail. \n\n\nEssentially, I have very few ideas of other avenues to explore so I\'m hoping you will have some.\n\n\n# Personal details:\n* **Stats:** 21M, 6\'5"", 147 lbs/66.7 kg, 17.4 BMI, white \n* **Primary Complaint:** Pain on my *entire* right side starting in November 2019 and increasing gradually in intensity since then. Since the beginning, the pain wasn\'t concentrated on my right side but for the past 4-5 months, it mostly has been. It seems like the pain originates in my right lower back/right hip. I will go into more depth in the ""Symptoms"" section.\n* **Preexisting Medical Conditions:** I was diagnosed with minor scoliosis in 2016. I forget the degrees of the curve but it wasn\'t (and isn\'t) major. I\'ve also always had some eczema-like situation going on on the back of my arms but have no idea what it is and it\'s never been uncomfortable. Other than that, on paper, I\'m a healthy kid.\n* **Substances:** No medications currently (I have tried various supplements, a steroid, and NSAIDS, however), and no alcohol.\n\n\n# Symptoms:\n* **Pain Description:** I would describe it as muscle pain. It\'s not a sharp sort of pain but more of an intense muscle ache wherever it occurs.\n * **Locations:** The pain started out being all over my back but in the past 4-5 months, it has moved into nearly all of my right side. It seems to originate in my back (~L2) and is felt distally nearly everywhere on my right side (right side headaches for the past few weeks, neck, jaw, cheek, upper back, lower back, shoulder, arm, hand, fingers, buttock, quad, hamstring, calf, achilles, toes, and foot). I don\'t feel the pain in all of these places at once but during any given day, I can be pretty sure that I will feel it in all right-side places at some point during that day. Essentially, I\'m not in full right side pain at any given moment.\n * **Joints:** I can ""click"" some of my right joints on command (wrist, hip, ankle, and I used to be able to do the right side of my jaw but not anymore). Very rarely do these joints hurt or feel inflamed.\n * **Triggers:** \n     * Sitting in a chair/car seat without ice/heat causes my right hip and the right side of my back (~L2) to hurt more than normally. Sometimes, seemingly randomly, sitting will also hurt my right foot, right calf, or even right arm/shoulder. \n     * Standing for a while generally causes the area ~L2, my buttock, and sometimes right foot to start. \n     * Laying on my right side hurts my right hip. Laying on my back isn\'t too bad though.\n     * Laying flat on my back, knees to chest hurts my right hip but not left. I think it\'s the hip flexor but am not sure.\n * **Most Intense Places:** Quite consistently, regardless of posture, the worst places are by far my right hip, right buttock, and right lower back. \n* **Flexibility/mobility:** Nearly perfect. I have very few issues moving and no stiffness. In a lot of cases, moving around actually feels good. The one caveat to this is my right hand which I\'ll cover in **Physical Asymmetry**.\n* **Twitching:** I have a hunch (that could absolutely be wrong) that my muscles (shoulder, arm, back, hip) twitch a little more than the normal person. It happens maybe once or twice a day but I have no idea if this is something noteworthy.\n* **Sleep:** Thankfully, most nights I am able to get to sleep without ice. Nearly every morning, like clockwork, I get a few minutes of feeling normal and quite pleasant but as soon as I start moving around or lay in bed awake for a few minutes, the pain comes back. Not sure if this is something noteworthy, either.\n* **Physical Asymmetry:** \n  * When I lay on my back, the right side of my lumber spine is noticeably further off of the ground than the left side.\n  * Raising only the middle finger in my right hand (think flipping off) is much harder to do than in my left (it\'s harder to collapse my right pointer than the left). Same with ASL ""I love you"". In general, hand motions that involve touching fingers with each other and collapsing them are much harder to do (and more painful) in my right hand than left hand. This situation my be due to the fact that I\'m left handed, though?\n  * When I lay flat on my back, fully relaxed, my right foot lays fully on the ground and my left doesn\'t lay flat. Not sure if this is normal human being stuff though.\n\n# Imaging/labs:\n\nI\'ve had two MRIs (lumbar spine in November \'20 and sacrum/pelvis in April \'21). The report for the lumbar spine says I\'ve got ""mild bilateral arthropathy"" in T12-L3 and moderate in L3-S1. The report from the sacrum/pelvis says nothing useful. These images could be uploaded if that would be helpful. \n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/a/dp148b7) is one of the X-rays that I had. Doc said that the twisting in my vertebrae could be causing some of the issue and recommended PT which had no effect after ~6 weeks.\n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/a/w11DIAT) is all of the bloodwork that I\'ve had done and from my understanding, there\'s nothing exciting here. Hopefully that\'s wrong.\n\n# Timeline:\n\n* **Nov 2019:** Jaw started clicking. In order to open it, I needed to move it to the side a little bit. Not painful or inconvenient, just different and slightly alarming. At this time, lower back started slightly hurting on *both sides* as well.\n* **Spring/Summer/Fall 2020:** Pain increased in intensity slightly. I climbed and played tennis a fair amount during this time. Sitting down in a chair to do work started to become painful. Only my back was affected at this point, I hadn\'t started feeling pain anywhere else in my body. There were a few days where my right foot would hurt slightly but it was very low intensity. \n* **Winter 2020/Spring 2021** This is about when the pain move into being exclusively on mostly my right side, right foot started to hurt much more during this time. Jaw has stopped clicking (but has started to hurt on opening) and hip has started to hurt much more.\n\nI didn\'t keep the best records during this fiasco so I apologize for the lack of details.\n\n# Attempted solutions (in no particular order):\n\n### Some relief:\n* **Ice:** Useful for *temporarily* killing pain in most intense areas.\n* **Heat:** Useful for *temporarily* killing pain in most intense areas. I ended up with erythema ab igne (hot water bottle rash) after prolonged use so I know no longer apply heat.\n* **Walking:** In Nov \'20 - Feb \'21, I\'d take daily walks (about 2 miles). They are somewhat pleasant. Pain generally subsides while on the walk but comes back afterwards.\n* **TENS Unit:** Useful for *temporarily* killing pain in most intense areas.\n* **Standing Desk:** Standing is much more bearable than sitting, especially with some comfortable shoes that I purchased but by no means is it comfortable, especially for prolonged periods.\n\n### No relief:\n* **Ibuprofen:** Works for the standard headache, muscle strain from sports, etc. but not at all for the pain I\'m trying to describe here. I\'ve tried different dose sizes and scheduled doses neither of which have efficacy.\n* **Medrol Steroid Pack:** On February 16, 2021, I had my first dose and the following day woke up in the most pain I have had. It was both the most widespread and highest intensity. No change happened after that.\n* **Glucosamine Chondroitin:** From what the rheumatologist said, GC is more of a placebo than anything. I gave it multiple multi-month attempts with no positive results.\n* **Turmeric/Circumin Supplements:** No positive results from this either.\n* **Inversion Table:** 1x/day for a few weeks aggravated my symptoms and actually hurt more than before.\n* **Copper Jewelry:** I\'ve been wearing a copper bracelet for a few weeks but to no avail. From what I\'ve seen, copper doesn\'t have medicinal effects anyways but it\'s a cheap experiment.\n* **Diet Changes:** I tried eating nothing but beef/water/salt for three weeks in December \'20 to no avail. For the last few weeks, I\'ve been eating no grains/sugar/processed foods, also to no avail. I suppose the next logical step is to completely remove animals and their byproducts and reintroduce grains?\n* **PT:** I\'ve tried multiple programs both on my own and with practitioners, none of which have worked. I have tried Stuart McGill\'s Big Three (along with most of the other things in *Back Mechanic*), the Egoscue Method, dynamic neuromuscular stabilization (DNS), and miscellaneous exercises with one of my PTs. Nothing has helped.\n* **Yoga:** Sometime in Summer \'20, I did a session everyday for two weeks with no improvement.\n* **Stretching/Rolling:** In Dec/Nov \'19 and Jan \'20 I tried multiple ""stretches for back pain""-type videos from Youtube for a few weeks at a time to no avail. I also tried some foam-rolling.\n* **Chiropractic Adjustment:** In Summer \'20, I had two sessions with my local chiropractor and received a vague diagnosis of ""inflamed facet joints"" after him seemingly doing nothing to actually arrive at this diagnosis. I decided to not continue this after feeling no different after each session.\n* **New Chairs:** I purchased a Hermann-Miller Aeron in Summer \'20 but it actually felt like it made sitting even more painful than normal. I currently have a version of the Steelcase Leap but I can\'t last longer than 5 minutes in it without ice.\n* **Medical Professionals:** I\'ve seen two orthopedic surgeons, two neurosuregons, two PTs, a chiropractor, family doc, and now a rheumatologist all of which has netted no diagnosis. I just got a letter on April 30 from Mayo\'s neurology department saying that they won\'t see me. Anybody know if this is a lost cause or if there\'s still some way to ""get in""?\n \n### Unattempted solutions:\n* **Accupuncture:** This is an expensive service but I will likely explore it soon.\n* **Steroid Injection:** I\'m not jazzed up about doing one of these with a very vague idea of why we\'re doing it. Again though, it might be worth exploring as a ~cheap~ experiment.\n* **Killing Nerves:** One of the surgeons described this procedure (I forget the jargon he used) but this doesn\'t seem like a good idea without a clear objective, especially since all of my right side hurts, not just my back.

They\'re probably due to juniper pollen.\n* I live in a very dry climate. We have low precipitation and low humidity. \n* Sometime in 2016, I received a diagnosis for mild scoliosis but I recently saw the diagnosing physician with an updated MRI (that I had in Nov \'20) and he didn\'t think that the scoliosis was related to the pain.\n* There hasn\'t been any particularly traumatic event (physically or psychologically) that has happened that might have caused this ordeal. The closest thing I can recall is a March \'20 ski accident but that happened after all of this started (in November \'19).\n* Seemingly regardless of my diet, for 3+ years, I have had mostly Type 1 stool according to [the Bristol stool scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_stool_scale).

Guys I am so freaking happy that the ball is finally rolling! I dont know if anyone is interested in my diagnosis process, but I could very much update yall who are curious, concerned, experiencing something similar, etc. \n\nEDIT April 11: Around 3PM, felt super dizzy and sat down for five minutes, got up to get a water bottle and fainted. Lost consciousness for about 10 seconds. Woke up to my mom standing over me and shouting my name. Super lucky that I no longer live alone. Blood sugar level taken right after,  normal at a 7.0, but strangely enough, I woke up at noon today and hadnt eaten yet, though I ate twice yesterday. \n\nEDIT April 15: I did the gastroscopy.

Even asked if I ate salad, but the last time I had salad was a week ago. :( He originally planned to biopsy my esophagus, stomach, and pancreas, but also biopsied my small intestine. Will get results and update this post. \n\n19F, 62, 107 lbs., Arab/Latina, medication: Marvellon (birth control), known health conditions: hypertension, Canada\n\nIve been having gastrointestinal symptoms since June 28, 2020. I will list them:\n\nRESOLVED symptoms (they just suddenly stopped after around 4 months):\n- Abdominal pain, uncomfortable to move. Felt like my stomach was being squeezed/pounded. Pain located centrally, around and below the navel. Pain was a 6/10.\n- Pelvic pain, unable to move. Felt like my pelvis was being crushed repeatedly. Pain was located in the pubic region, spreading from the centre to either or both sides. Pain was a 9/10.\n- Eczema/rashes, mainly on inner hand and fingers and on the inner leg near the crease of my knee. SUPER ITCHY. Sometimes on arms. Didnt use any creams, it went away on its own. \n\nOngoing symptoms:\n\nNausea, hypersensitive to scents (makes me extremely nauseous, I cant eat food with spices/strong scent), loss of appetite, rapid weight loss, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, vision darkening, eye floaters, tinnitus when experiencing severe vertigo, short-term memory loss, confusion, distortion, malnutrition bruises, bruising easily,  on/off hip pain (feels like theyre bruised), on/off back pain (spine and lower back extreme discomfort), muscle pain (quadriceps feel extremely sore most days as if I did an intense strength training session on my legs), on/off upper arm pain like theyre bruised, on/off collarbone pain like theyre bruised, vomiting: bile/after a coughing fit/after eating, night sweats, sweaty and seriously sticky hands, thirsty, frequent urination, hunched/stooped over when walking, palpitations, also my urine is darker and smells strong (maybe like ammonia?) which I assume is because I dont get enough nutrients. \n\nExtra details: I eat maybe one actual meal a week if Im lucky. I will have little snacks some days, a few bites of something that I truly have to force myself to eat to the point I feel sick and I have to stop so I dont throw up. I usually go 2-3 days at a time without eating anything at all though I started to recently take multivitamins, and I have been consistently drinking a lot of water and electrolytes since the beginning of all of this. I throw up probably 5/7 days of the week, and more often, bile now since as the time goes by, I eat less and less. \n\nIn February, I got a 30 day prescription for JAMP-dimenhydrinate (this did not help me much, but it helped with my coughing fits a little bit) and Dexillant which I had to stop taking after barely a week because it gave me steatorrhea so severe, I went to the bathroom 7 times in a 12 hour timeframe which resulted in me getting two haemorrhoids (they are gone now) and losing 4 lbs. It didnt even benefit me in the end as it did not build an appetite for me, though helped alleviate my daily morning nausea, but not enough to completely suppress it. \n\nMarch 27, I got a lymph node on my neck that went down, but came back up again, normal grape size.\nToday, I feel another lymph node on my armpit, the size of a fat blueberry. \nI did a CBC and a bunch of other blood tests on March 25 that would indicate no infection however my CRP level was slightly elevated. \nThings ruled out (I have done between 2-5 different blood tests for these because every doctor thinks the result is going to somehow change): Crohns disease, anemia, celiac disease, thyroid disorders, diabetes, Bergers disease, cirrhosis, hypophosphatasia. \n(I also say 2-5 because I did 5 CBCs in total and some of them didnt have repeats of certain things). \n\nI have a gastroscopy coming up soon, but Im just waiting and waiting and waiting for a date, and at this point, dont know if going to the ER will do anything, I will probably still be treated as unimportant and non-urgent even though Ive lost so much weight so rapidly. Any recommendations on tests to ask for? Any diseases or illnesses with similar symptoms that I could bring up to my doctor? (BTW- my doctor is actually a resident). I am not asking for a diagnosis, Im asking what is wrong with me and why isnt anyone taking it seriously? Any other specialists I should inquire to see?'"
atenolol,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical_advice/comments/j8yjvx/atenolol_stopped_cold_turkey/,b'Atenolol stopped cold turkey ???',,b'SORRY THIS POST IS EVERYWHERE I KNOW BUT BARE WITH ME \nI (21F) was put on metoprolol three months ago. Then three weeks ago my cardiologist put me on Atenolol 25 mg instead. I took a half for about a week and then realized it was waaaay too strong. Started quartering the Atenolol and taking a quarter in the morning and a quarter at night. This STILL bottomed my BP. I was put on the beta blocker for my heart rate running above 190 BPM at rest. My BP was running high (the highest it ever got was 178/127) yeah I know crazy dangerous. But even the quarter of atenolol was way too much for me dropping it 90/55 or 100/85. i was miserable on the medicine and couldnt stand it anymore and told my cardiologist. He said while we wait for my 2 week Holter monitor results lets stop the atenolol cold turkey and he put me on a Calcium channel blocker 50 mg( flecaneide) twice a day and a 2.5 dose of (Amlodipine) once a day. even with me quartering the atenolol and it only being a 6.5 mg dose twice a day every twelve hours Im still scared that I will have beta blocker withdrawals. I took my last dose of Atenolol lastnight and started the new medicine this morning. My heart rate is already higher than usual and staying around 120 BPM. My question is this: is this a huge risk my cardiologist chose to take by starting the new meds Cold Turkey or should it be fine since it was a low dose of Atenolol already?'
Tetracycline problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/ynr4a7/my_personal_guide_to_how_i_cleared_the_majority/,b'My Personal Guide to How I Cleared the Majority of my Acne',,"b'  \n\n**Revised:** after some helpful feedback Ive made some changes to suggestions made in my guide. Please let me know if you have anything that you dont agree with, as I am always open to discussion!\n\nHey everyone! I have been wanting to make this for a while because I have had a long journey with acne and helping others deal with this health condition has always been something I wanted to do.\n\nFirst, this is what worked for me! Unfortunately, everyone is different and may or may not experience positive results; however, it is my belief that there is a lot of helpful information here for everyone!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Basics**\n\n\\- Any acne treatment starts with a good skincare routine. This should include salicylic acid in some form, a gentle cleanser, and a moisturizer + SPF. \n\n\\- Moisturizers are extremely important even for oily skin\n\n\\- SPF SPF SPF! I recommend something like Cerave daily SPF, the sun is one of the worst things for causing skin damage and SPF is so important!\n\n\\- No Picking or Squeezing! Rub ice on pimples for a couple of minutes, twice a day. If you pick, squeeze, and break the skin, that scab will leave a red mark. \n\n\\- I often cant avoid picking/squeezing: If you must squeeze, do so with a metal tool designed for extraction that is sanitized and apply salicylic acid to the area or ice to bring down inflammation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lifestyle**\n\n\\- Never use fabric softener or dryer sheets on any pillowcases, towels, washcloths, or sheets! The wax can get on your skin and clog pores.\n\n\\- Use a gentle detergent for sensitive skin that is fragrance free.\n\n\\- Do not touch your face, the more your hands touch your face the more you introduce bacteria, oils, and other irritants.\n\n\\- Sleep: get as much sleep as possible, youre aiming for 7+ hours\n\n\\- Stress: try using exercise or medication, yoga, etc. To reduce stress as it is a huge cause of skin problems.\n\nFoods Which May Cause Acne (For me)\n\n\\- Dairy products (milk, cheese, especially low/nonfat, whey protein) \n\n\\- Soy products \n\n\\- Red and processed meat\n\n\\- Products with iodine or Iodized salt\n\n\\- Seaweed, kelp, miso soup\n\n\\- Highly processed foods (cookies, cakes, potato chips, French fries, white breads).\n\n\\- Products high in sugars\n\n\\- Drinks (pop, juices, energy drinks).\n\nFoods Which May Help Inflammation\n\n\\- Green tea\n\n\\- Fatty fish (Salmon, mackerel, herring, white fish, halibut)\n\n\\- Berries and fruits low in sugar\n\n\\- Any vegetables\n\n\\- Replace everything you can with a ""whole grain"" alternative\n\n\\- Drink as much water as possible!\n\n\\- Generally, anything with a low glycemic load and index is good for acne!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Supplements That May Help**  **ALWAYS CONSULT A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER**\n\n\\- Zinc tablets 50-100mg  use short term and discontinue once skin clears\n\n\\- Turmeric capsules\n\n\\- Vitamin A  use cautiously as high vitamin A levels are extremely dangerous\n\n\\- Vitamin E\n\n\\- Vitamin D  1000iu\n\n\\- Avoid multivitamins with biotin and iodine\n\n\\- Probiotics are great, especially if you have used doxy, minocycline, tetracycline, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skincare**\n\nSkincare is particularly important (obviously). My current nighttime routine is:\n\n1. Wash face with Cerave gentle cleanser or Oxy salicylic acid wipes\n\n2. Use a hydrating serum (such as Vichy mineral 89 or any hyaluronic acid)\n\n3. Use salicylic acid as a spot treatment if needed (The Ordinary Salicylic Acid Serum)\n\n4. Apply a high-quality moisturizer (The INKEY list multi-biotic moisturizer)\n\n5. Apply retinoid (prescription) every other day or every three days depending on dryness.\n\na. Change pillowcase every night if possible\n\nb. In the morning I do the same except I replace retinol with SPF (The Ordinary SPF) or (Cerave SPF all in one moisturizer). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Makeup**\n\nLoose powder and mineral make-up tend to be best. I use (Burts Bees 100% Natural Mattifying Foundation). Im male so I can get away with lighter coverage easier due to public gender standards. \n\n\\- It is especially important to wash your face well if using makeup! \n\n\\- Natural oils like coconut are among the most pore clogging ingredients you can use.\n\n\\- Make sure to read the label for ingredients like coconut oil \n\n**Potential Prescriptions / Treatments**\n\n\\- Antibacterial creams (prescriptions) can work well in the short term but generally do not work long term as bacteria builds resistance. \n\n\\- Retinoids/retinol is a better option in my opinion to use long term.\n\n\\- I Personally cant use Benzoyl peroxide, it bleaches everything, and I react poorly to it, but its effective for many people\n\n\\- Prescription retinoids often come combined with an antibiotic, these can be great options to get acne under control.\n\n\\- Oral antibiotics like doxycycline, minocycline, etc. can be used short term.\n\n\\- In stubborn cases Accutane may be prescribed, it works well but may have significant side effects.\n\n\\- Hormonal treatments like birth control and anti-androgens (spironolactone) can be used in females, these both have side-effects that you should talk to your doctor about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Closing**\n\nFollowing this guide may or may not lead to positive results for your acne. In my experience this has nearly cured me of my cystic acne. I have never used Accutane, but I think it is important to include it here for potential treatment.\n\nYou may not be able to follow everything in this guide but just know that everything makes a difference! Good luck!'"

I\'ve had a recurrent rash above my lips since January, and it has never completely gone away although the severity flares up from time to time. There is one rash on each side of my top lip, pictured below.\n\nSome info about me:\n\nI\'m a 22 year old cisgender white woman living in the Mid-Atlantic US. I\'m 5\'9"" and about 155 lbs. \n\nI\'ve been diagnosed with depression, generalized anxiety disorder, chronic migraine, and mild asthma. I suffered from pretty severe eczema as a child, and though it has improved, it has not gone away completely and I get mild patches from time to time. I also frequently experience indigestion, constipation, and other GI issues. I had a laprascopic cholecystectomy in 2017. I have a severe allergy to nightshades (tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, eggplant). I have painful periods including severe cramps, though I have an IUD now which mitigates the symptoms.\n\n I currently take 125mg Sertraline daily, Ativan as needed for anxiety (I usually take 1-2 per month), Nabumetone as needed for migraine, DHE nasal spray as needed for migraine, and a monthly injection of Emgality for migraine. Albuterol inhaler as needed for asthma. \n\nI\'ve had this rash above my lips since January. First, it was only on the left side of my upper lip, though not actually on the lip itself. I chalked it up to dry winter weather, but the rash has persisted for several months now. About 6-8 weeks ago, another rash appeared above my lips, this time on the right side. It is almost like a mirror of the other rash. At its worst, it is red, itchy, and sometimes ""oozy."" The rashes will usually improve, with most of the redness and itchiness going away, though I can still feel a difference in texture.\n\nFor treatment at home, I\'ve tried a few things: over the counter eczema cream (which sometimes helps with redness, but doesn\'t do much to actually get rid of the rash), Aquaphor, and a [lip balm](https://eczemahoneyco.com/products/eczema-honey-nourishing-lip-balm) from Eczema Honey, which helps with moisture and itching but again doesn\'t actually do much for the rash itself. \n\nAny ideas what this might be? I\'ve attached some photos below. I am so thankful for any advice, as this has been really bothering me for several months now. I\'m curious to see if these may be connected to any other issues I experience.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kku6rtpth9951.jpg?width=2165&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=22f178c35a165169f34b3348968eebc574fb24b2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wk4rkvnth9951.jpg?width=1388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=99bd7d0aee7c83f9a1db8ab5d28dac59b4f4ddfc\n\nThank you!'"

I\'m on a host of other medications, but I seem to be misspelling words left and right since I was started on these two medications.\n\nI tried overdosing, failed, and then went to an inpatient program for a little under two weeks. I was started initially on Trazodone, Topamax, and a some other medications because I had depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, nightmares, and that attempt. The Trazodone was a wonder with my insomnia, which I had struggled with puberty. Unfortunately, it fucked with me heavily in the morning. To the point of me not being able to walk properly. In fact, I fell so hard that I sprained my ankle. So, the psychiatrist took me off of it and put me on Remeron instead.\n\nI feel should give you a full rundown of the meds on right now, but Topamax and Remeron are the main two, but Adderall is a big contributor too:\n\n* Topamax 100mg/night\n* Remeron 30mg/night\n* Adderall 40mg/day 20mg/afternoon\n* Ambien 10mg or 20mg/night\n* Hydrochlorothiazide (Blood pressure med/diuretic) 25mg/day\n* Prilosec 20mg/day\n\n\nSo basically, I\'m wondering if anyone else has had experience with either of these meds. I know it isn\'t the Adderall, HCTZ, Prilosec, or Ambien. I\'ve been on all of those meds besides the Ambien in the past, and none of them have given me trouble with my cognition. In fact, Adderall makes me smarter than when I don\'t take it. Ambien doesn\'t seem to impair any cognitive functions after usage, so that can\'t be it.\n\nInformation seems to be light on the net for either of these meds. I get the feeling it\'s the Topamax, given that it seems to be called ""_Dopamax_"" on forums. I\'ve discussed it with my psychiatrist, but he seems to think it\'s all it\'s just in my head. I think that\'s bullshit. I won a state spelling bee when I was in 11th grade, so when I just misspelled the word ""bee,"" I think there is something wrong.\n\nAny experience or comments you have to share? \n\nEdit: Case in point, the context I had used for many of the words were wrong.

Bonus points to me for having nearly every side effect from every single prescription I\'ve ever taken.... But what I don\'t understand is why they are *so much worse* for bipolar meds. Why is that? Why don\'t they make things people can easily take long term.

In fact I actually developed a cyst on my gum but it was short term and hasn\'t come back.  \nThis problem persisted and continued to get worse, I began getting huge cysts on and behind my ears, then my jaw, neck, chest, penis and back. I developed a huge one in the crack of where the lord split me.(butt) It was painful but popped and went away, since then hasn\'t occurred again. However they are reoccurring on my face,ears,back,chest, and neck. They are painful and when popped will ooze a clear liquid and feel as if air is coming out or almost like deflating, if that makes sense.  \nThere is no smell to the clear oozing liquid. They get significantly large in size, become red and inflamed, and significantly painful. They last anywhere from a week to 3 weeks sometimes longer before disappearing but as soon as one disappears, another one or two take its place. They seem to reoccur where old ones had been, this isn\'t the case always.  \nGenerally they scab up making me look like I am using meth, it\'s so bad I have given up dating since they began and it has steadily grown worse. So much that some-days I don\'t want to leave the house to go to work or the store. I don\'t like looking in the mirror and especially hate taking pictures because these annoying cysts have lowered my self esteem so much.  \n\n\nI\'ve had blood work ran numerous times, no STD\'s, and all the results ""appeared to be normal."" 5 years ago I was hospitalized for MRSA infection and still have a huge scar from where they had to cut my shoulder open to drain, flush, and pack the wound. I was in there for 7 days.  \n\n\nHere\'s what I take.  \nI was in Pain Management for years because of several disc issues in my back. L4/L5 the worst and C-spine. After my daughter was born I began using kratom and left pain management.  \nI have taken Kratom without breaks for almost two years which as you can imagine has increased my tolerance exponentially... I can take an OZ a day generally a little less but sometimes more. I don\'t measure my doses I just load a big old country tablespoon up and toss/wash. It has helped my pain, my IBS-D, my PTSD, ADHD, and anxiety.  \n\n\nI\'m on two prescriptions right now, which I have been on almost my whole life. One being relatively new at a year but I rarely take it.  \n(1) *Adderall* (**DextroAmphetamine**) **30MG IR 2x daily** (During the work week I take it 2 times daily but on weekends I take anywhere from 1 to 1.5. I\'ve been on this since I was 6 or 7 years old and been on it continuously.   \n(2) *Librium*  (**Chlordiazepoxide)** **25MG 3x daily** (This is the one I rarely take.. I actually probably have about 200 pills from left overs if not more.)  \n\n\nOTC medication/supplements  \n(1) Ibuprofen, motrin, advil etc. (Not everyday but atleast 2x a week.)  \n(2)Tylenol or BC-Powders (Atleast 1 to 2 times a week, I try to avoid these.)  \n(3) Level-Up- Mushrooms LVL:Max (Just started these this week. 3 capsules at night. Chaga,Lions mane, and Cordycep mushrooms)  \n(4)Kratom (Daily usage, heavy doses-At least 2-3 tablespoons at a time. 4-6x daily)-My family thinks its from kratom.  \n(5) Energy drinks such as Reign and Bang which contain BCAA,Creatine, taurine, caffeine, CoQ10. I\'ve stopped consuming this but on general I was drinking 2-3 daily. It\'s been at least 3 days since I have switched to coffee and the cysts appear to be getting better and skin is clearing up. However it\'s done this before right before it hits me hard. \n\nI also vape but do not use drugs or drink. However the few times I have drank my skin started to clear up, kinda weird isn\'t it?  \n\n\nI\'ve used 80-90% ispropyl alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, Salicylic acid 2% Skin pads, zapit and other zit/acne creams.  \nI\'ve tried atleast 5-8 antibiotics ranging from Penocillin 500 2 or 3x daily, cepholexin, doxycyline, etc.  \nCorticosteriod cream for the inflammation. I have tried a lot of home remedies such as taping a cut potato to sit overnight on the cyst, putting castrol oil on it before bed, charcoal scrubs, etc.  \n\n\nI\'m 23 years old, have a good BMI and good weight (5""11 or 6""0) weighing 153lbs.  \nMy diet fluctuates but I try to eat as healthy as possible.

This is in addition to my ADHD-PI that was diagnosed last year. I feel like I\'ve made it this far because I happen to be lucky enough to have attractive features, and I\'m decent at masking. For a while, anyway. And then people get to know me, and think I\'m weird. Friends drop out of my life after a year or two, and it breaks my heart every time.\n\nOne of my obsessions is drumming, and I\'m very good at it. I\'ve been in about 14 bands since I was 16 years old. I promise I\'m not exaggerating. But the majority of them fizzle out, or have a heartbreaking break up. It\'s taken a toll on my since drumming is one of my big passions. I want to keep going, but the pain of one band after another not working out is wearing on me.\n\nI have aphantasia and facial blindness. I\'m lucky if I can imagine very dark blurry shapes of things. I can\'t imagine it remember how my own face looks, or even how my own mother\'s face looks. It fucks with me because I can\'t even remember some people that I use to peripherally see daily for years. It\'s as if they died and are gone forever.\n\nThings that most people would be able to handle have traumatized me. I\'ve moved twice in my life, and both times have caused me enormous amounts of pain and suffering. It felt like my life had ended, and everyone and everything I knew had died. I think my brain forgets about people and things to cope with how painful it is to me. The autism was still undiscovered, so I just thought I was going insane.\n\nI\'ve ran the gambit of 12+ psychological medications, and a number of misdiagnosis including generalized anxiety disorder, major depression, bipolar disorder, and clinical insomnia. Turns out this was mostly because of the undiagnosed ADHD and autism, so everyone just thought I was a lazy weird fuck up. At least that\'s how it felt. The bipolar, and especially insomnia meds fucked me up. I lost large chunks of memory of my life because a doctor prescribed me 60+ day supply of ambien with several refills, which I didn\'t know was addicting and caused memory problems until I experienced it myself. That same doctor told me to my face, if he had me as an employee, he\'d fire me due to my insomnia. That\'s another one on the trauma pile.\n\nOnly later with therapy, trauma healing, ketamine, and lion\'s mane mushroom was I able to recover memories of my childhood and teenage years.\n\nI\'m separated in my marriage, and feel so guilty and at fault for so many things I don\'t want to put here. I would have acted so differently if I knew. I feel guilt and shame every day from this. Doesn\'t help being raised in the mormon church, where I obsessed a d lamented over every ""sin"" I made as a child.\n\nOne of my anxieties is fear of poverty. It\'s pushed me to the point where I\'m becoming an excellent certified systems administrator, with only a year left until I finish my bachelor\'s. But I have the hardest time spending even the smallest dime. I deprive myself of good food, home decor, clothing that I want, replacing my decaying car, all because I ""don\'t need it"". It is physically painful for me to spend money, even though I make plenty of it. And I\'m suffering greatly because of it.\n\nI barely have energy to do anything after working 8 hours. My schooling and social life suffers heavily because of that. Even on the job, I feel constantly exhausted. Because I have a life long problem with going to sleep and waking up, I\'m late nearly every day. If it weren\'t for the ADA, I\'d be fucked harder than I am.\n\nI\'ve worked 9 jobs between ages 15 and 29, because I could barely handle most of them. The majority of them made me miserable. A call center job almost made me kill myself.\n\nI\'ve read most major self help and even a decent amount of occult books because I\'m desperate to lighten the load. They\'ve helped marginally.\n\nI\'m conscious of everything that I need to do, almost all the time. Meditation and anti depressants help a little, but it wears on me hard.\n\nI\'m working on accomodating the disorder rather than trying to overcome the symptoms.

No numbness or tingling, but a tightness to my jaw. This resolved within an hour and I thought nothing of it. It happened again a couple days later, and I decided to go to urgent care next door to my work. They checked my vitals and for signs of a stroke, said it was just my anxiety, and sent me on my way. This speech issue happened a couple other times throughout the week in different scenarios (talking to a customer, talking to a coworker, training a new employee). All of these episodes resolved within an hour. \n\n3 days ago, my speech issues happened again. I was at home this time. It was so severe that my husband was very concerned. The issues had not gone away for 4 hours. There was a slight bit of a feeling of numbness this day. I scheduled a phone call with a teledoc who advised me to go to the ER. \n\nI went to the ER, they took my vitals upon arrival and sent me back to the waiting room. They did not do blood work. They called me back and placed me on a bed in the hallway, a doctor came by and asked me about what was going on, did a set of motor skills tests, checked my mouth and tongue, and ordered a CT scan (w/o contrast) for me. My CT scan was clear and she suggested I scheduled an appointment with a neurologist for an MRI and further testing. My speech issues did not resolve until the next day. \n\nYesterday, my speech disturbance was present all day and continued to get worse as the day progressed. My mouth was very sore and tight at the end of the day and felt like I had been smiling for 9 hours straight. I made an appointment with my dentist to rule out any jaw/teeth issues. I also began feeling much more lightheaded, fatigued, and had a couple instances of vertigo yesterday.\n\nI went to the dentist today where they did a panoramic X-ray. There was nothing of concern in the X-rays. \n\nSo far I have not determined any triggers for these episodes of speech difficulties. They do not correlate with my migraines. There is no tingling, drooping or pain in my body when these episodes occur.  \n\nMy PCP is out of town until next Wednesday and I did schedule an appointment with her to see what she suggests we do or see what could be going on. I could make an appointment sooner, but my PCP knows my medical history best. Any ideas of what could be going on here or ways to improve my symptoms for the time being? Ive attached my notes from the ER in the comments. (Note that I did not see my PCP on 5/15 but rather the urgent care doctor)\n\nCross posted on r/AskDocs as well'"
Advil eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/134ahnu/genetic_issue_constant_pain_please_help/,b'Genetic issue? Constant pain - Please help.',,"b'When I (35f) was 17 I had constant pain in a tooth on the upper left (I believe its #2). The dentist I saw couldnt find anything explicitly wrong though he said there may be a hairline fracture but the x ray wasnt conclusive. Due to the pain the tooth was extracted and I had an implant done. Years later in my late 20s the same thing happened on the parallel tooth on the upper right (I believe #15). There was nothing explicitly wrong but due to constant pain it was removed and I had an implant done. The dentist at the time (who has since retired) said it may be a genetic issue seeing as it was the same tooth just on opposite sides. \nI just had my second baby in January. About 4 weeks after my baby was born the implants started bothering me. The one on the left became loose and it was discovered that the implant failed so I had it removed and had a bone graft done. However, a problem remains on the right side. The pain is achey, mostly dull but overwhelming at times. It doesnt feel like sharp tooth pain like a cavity but rather an overall pain stemming from that area. It radiates behind my check above the tooth and up to my inner eye. I massage above my teeth/cheek and around my eye for relief along with taking Advil or Aleve to help with the pain. I dont want to keep taking medicine to help and Im feeling like the only option is to have this remaining implant removed, however its not failing which was confirmed when the other failed implant was identified. So removing this implant without a confirmed issue would feel like a huge waste of the time and money that went into it. Im hoping someone here can help with any suggestions as to what could be causing this or how I can address it. Thanks.'"

I've been on this for a month now.\n\nThe first month I was seeing improvements. More fatigue but less panic and willing to go out more and drive further. The second month was getting better until halfway. I got plagued with derealization, migraines, and severe diziness. Tried to shake it off but so far still have them.\n\nAlso for the last 3 weeks I've got inflammation all over my body and joints. I feel like I'm being bound down. It aches to move. Feels like my joints are locked and I'm so tense 24/7. Also the anxiety is back with a vengenance. As if I wasn't on these meds anymore. Very tired. Dizzy. Sensitive to light, loud noises, everything really.\n\nI saw a Rheumatologist for the joint and body pain and got a cortisone shot to help relieve it. No effect really. Celebrex is barely helping.\n\nDo you think this could be side effects from all of these meds? Am I just supposed to ride it out? Have the Benzos stopped working for anxiety? I also take Paracetamol on top of all this if I reach to a point where I can't handle my head exploding.\n\nI'm always walking around like there's sun on top of me.

She had a panic attack and hit her head. I wasn\'t with her at the time and I couldn\'t reach her fast but she called me on the phone in panic. She said she had stopped breathing for a while. She had trouble speaking and was very confused.\nMy gf is scared of strangers so she was against going to the hospital. But in the end I got scared that maybe she was in danger so I called 9-1-1.\n\nThey admitted her to the hospital and all I got was a text saying ""I hate you!"". Then a call asking me to go to the hospital to see her. When I got there she said she was sorry, that she panicked. The Doctor told her she was fine after waiting 8+ hours.\n\nI still don\'t think she fully understood how scared I was for her. We argued a lot in the past days because I feel like she\'s different. She says she doesn\'t resent me but it doesn\'t feel that way. She gets mad at me when I try to talk to her about something she does that I dislike.\n\nWhen I bring something up that\'s bothering me, she cuts off contact for a few hours and cries with her friends. They now thinks I am an asshole that keeps making her cry. Two days ago she told me that I was always making her feel bad. That I was toxic. Frankly, I don\'t know what to believe. I feel toxic now...\n\nYesterday we apologized and said we\'d work on communicating better. But today I had a hard time talking to her because she\'s just been acting weird and distant.\n\nWhen I brought it up to her on the phone tonight she just started giving ""mmh"" answers so I reminded her that she needed to communicate with me. She told me she was tired so I asked her when we could talk and she didn\'t answer. I asked again, and eventually just got mad because she didn\'t even try... She hung up on me and turned off her phone. She\'s probably crying in her friends\' arms right now because of me and I feel horrible about it.\n\nI think this isn\'t working out, however I feel stuck.\n\nI\'m stuck because I know how she has faith that intimacy must be shared with one and only man throughout her life and if I leave i\'d make her break that promise she made to herself. Even though it was consensual, I don\'t ever want to be a regret.\n\nI\'m stuck because her Father has been weirdly protective of her and even said he\'d ""fuck me up"" if I broke his daughter\'s heart. Idk how to feel about that.\n\nI just feel hostage but I want to stop hurting myself over this.\n\nI\'m trying to make things better but I feel like she just stopped caring.

But the gist of it is that I get a delayed onset of extreme fatigue  within days of exposure to an allergen . The fatigue lasts a week and is so debilitating that I dont have energy to work or even watch one hour of a TV show . My legs especially my thighs  even become weak from the fatigue .  When the symptoms occur I go see the doctor but all he says it that it may be due to my thyroid problems due to low thyroid test  numbers . The doctor can only do other tests to rule out other causes of fatigue but all other tests came back normal .  Ive had thyroid problems for 13 years and I know that thyroid itself doesnt cause fatigue to this extent. Additionally I only experience fatigue after consuming certain substances and not before then  .Thyroid and hormone problems may be to blame for the fact that my list of allergies keep increasing and increasing and only after learning the hard way do I find out Im allergic to something. I currently cant take Tylenol or Advil , soy sauce , Gas X , and recently I became allergic to chlorine after I sat in a hot tub and had itchy arms within minutes . I think my allergies start to increase after I took RAI treatment for Graves disease in 2016  . I also became allergic to the flu shot after 2017 after taking it for years with no problems .I spoke to my family doctor today and asked for an allergy test but he kept insisting that my fatigue was due to my my thyroid and to discuss it with my endocrinologist.

I thought this was unusual but I figured he had not got enough sleep that week. Saturday morning he had a fever. for the next few days I assumed he had a cold until Monday when he started to break out in rash and pimples on his arms, legs, chest and face. \n\nWe suspected staph, which he confirmed at a doctor\'s appointment on Tuesday. he works as a commercial electrician and received a cut last week which we think is the cause. Dr said take Bactrim DS tablets 1 by mouth 2x a day for 10 days and kelfex 500mg every 12 hours for 10 days. one antibiotic was for potential strep, but his culture was negative for strep. only positive for staph. \n\n\nI\'ve also given him day and night theraflu and acetaminophen for pain and fever, and vitamin C supplements. I\'ve also put cool rags on his head and chest to try to keep the fever down but it always ends up shooting back up.\n\n\nI\'m also concerned about how contagious he is at this point, to myself and my 10 year old son. I\'ve shared a bed with him the entire time but we have avoided intimacy or touching, and have washed clothes/towels daily and sheets every few days. my son and I have no symptoms at this point.\n\nnow we are on day 6. this is day 3 of antibiotics and really no change. He still has the marks, his eyes are bloodshot and most of the time his temperature is in the 102 range. It has been as low as 98 and as high as 103.3 this past week.

NSAID swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/21yf05/lithium_and_injury/,b'Lithium and Injury',,"b""I injured my foot badly in December (12/8/13, at least two broken metatarsals showed after they had healed on the second set of x-rays, they apparently could not be seen on the first, upon physical examination it appears I have a lot of soft tissue damage as well).  I've been unable to get Obamacare because I qualify for my states Medicaid but I can't get it through my state because a loophole in their system essentially disqualifies me (my state didn't take the federal money and doesn't have to play by Fed rules as a result).\n\nI've been unable to get regular treatment or any treatment outside two visits to the ER.  I was supposed to see an orthopedist, podiatrist, neurologist and physical therapist.  I haven't had the imaging studies I need to find out the actual problem (MRI, Cat Scan) since the ER apparently only does X-rays now.  The ER has since (2nd visit March 12th) diagnosed me with Reflexive Sympathetic Dystrophy, an incredibly painful neurological disorder that often begins with injury, I don't know if they're right but it is incredibly painful.  \n\nIn exactly a week I'll have been on crutches for four months and while my condition has improved it plateaued around month three and no longer appears to be getting better.  Throughout this I have yet to receive any adequate pain relief, I spent the first month in bed crying nearly non-stop from pain, it has improved but not enough.  \n\nI was given nebumatone an NSAID at the hospital which I didn't take because I'm on lithium (which they were well aware of and I voiced my concerns repeatedly).  Though I knew it had the potential to give me lithium toxicity after a few days it hurt so bad I didn't care and I filled the prescription and got a mild case of lithium toxicity.\n\nThe hospital refuses to give me anything but an nsaid for pain relief in spite of the contraindications.  I've stopped taking my lithium so I can get a little relief by taking this stupid drug that doesn't even do a good job relieving my pain, but it's better than Tylenol or nothing and I'm desperate my foot hurts so badly.\n\nI'm afraid to tell anyone I've gone off my lithium because I know how pissed my boyfriend, friends and family will be.  I know I haven't been myself, I walked away from my freelance job even though I desperately need the money.  I'm destabilizing rapidly, but I don't know what else to do. \n\nI've been in pain so long all my physical/emotional reserves for dealing with it are used up.  I can't sleep for more than a couple hours at a time, I can't walk.  If it is Reflexive Sympathetic Dystrophy my odds of walking normally ever again get worse the longer I am without aggressive treatment, especially physical therapy.\n\nIf I take these pills I can limp without my crutches I can do some of what I would do in physical therapy (broke the same foot in same places a little over a decade ago and remember how was rehabilitated last time).  \n\nI don't know what to do.  I'm not asking for advice I just need someone to listen because I can't tell anyone else.  I know it's a bad decision to go off my lithium but I don't see as I have any choice.  I need to be trying to rehab my foot and I can't do it if I don't have something to relieve pain and swelling.   Lithium has been one of my miracle drugs and I'm not doing well without it, there are no viable alternatives, I can't even afford to see my psychiatrist since I walked away from my freelance job.  \n\nI feel hopeless and helpless and the pain has made me suicidal for months now, they could have given me an opiate that wouldn't interfere with my meds but apparently no one does that anymore either; because drug seeking.  I don't understand why some people looking for drugs mean I can't get any relief.  I'm sorry so long but I just have no one else I can say any of this to and I needed to get it off my chest."""

I feel as if I\'ve existed for centuries. I can\'t stand it anymore. This whole idea of ""life is short"" is nonsense to me. Life just drags on endlessly and the older I get the more I just can\'t tolerate any of this. \n\nAll I want to do is sleep and when I\'m awake all I do is crave substances- alcohol and benzodiazepines specifically- I don\'t do much of either anymore because I just can\'t mentally or physically handle abusing drugs anymore. I absolutely hate being sober, I\'ve tried it for months on end- it\'s useless. Right now I\'m abusing a muscle relaxant called Baclofen because it is similar to benzos. Without it I would literally just off myself.\n\nI\'m angry that I exist- mom died by suicide when I was 18, I stopped talking to my father when I was 25. I had no normal childhood or teenage years whatsoever. But I\'m mostly over all of that- I don\'t really care anymore. Which is good and bad. \n\nLife in my 20s was at least fun and interesting- lots of friends and partying and adventures. Now it\'s all just worrying about paying off debts, car payments, rent, forcing myself to eat to stay alive when I don\'t want to at all.\n\nI have no intention of seeing age 40 unless some drastic changes happen that make me actually want to be a part of this world. Really there are only two people that keep me alive- my younger brother and my ""sort of"" girlfriend (it\'s complicated) whom also equally just doesn\'t want to be alive, so we understand each other. \n\nBeyond that all my former friendships are basically over as everyone has moved on. Everytime I try and save money to do something like travel I have to spend all my money on my massive debts (made a lot of stupid financial mistakes when I was in my 20s because I had no parental guidance or help whatsoever) so I\'m literally paying for it all and there\'s no way I\'ll be financially stable until like age 40. So there\'s really nothing to look forward to.\n\nI hate being in my 30s- it really feels like I\'m in purgatory and like I should have died years ago. Life is so long and endless when you see no meaning in it anymore, no parents to talk to. I\'m just over it all.'"

They prescribed me Doxycycline.\n\n\n\n- Now I have to mention that my skin and the sun have never really had huge problems. I have never been super sensitive to the sun, except maybe my eye-lids and upper lip lol. I rarely burn. That being said I was aware of the increased sensitivity with both medications. I didn't notice a huge difference with the Tretinoin, merhaps because my moisturizer had SPF.\n\n\n\n- After I started taking the Doxy I noticed that when I was out in the sun my skin everywhere would feel tingly and get warm which freaked me out bc I had never reacted to the sun like that. I work outside 75% of the work week, so I started taking precautions including wearing hats. I guess it didn't work because [a few days ago](https://imgur.com/a/1EVHF1G), small red itchy dots started showing up on my chest, neck and weird texture on my chin and forehead.

It wasnt as bad as my skin had been in high school, but it was consistent and very pesky. \n\nAbout a month ago, I removed my IUD due to the acne I was getting that was getting worse and worse, went back to the birth control pill I was on from before and I decided to go back to the dermatologist. \n\nWhen we spoke about my history and the toll it was taking on my mental health and energy, and because it worked so well for me previously, he OKd me for another round of lower dose accutane. 30mg per day for one month and then up to 60mg was the PLAN....\n\nI got all the blood work, got my prescription, and began. \n\nWithin 1 week, my skin was purging SO badly that it was too painful to sleep, eat and I had to use ice packs and Advil every day to knock out a tiny bit of the pain. My skin now looks about how it looked back in high school. Red, painful clusters of highly sensitive white heads, all coming at once. Its been really unbearable. I just talked to my dermatologist and told them i needed a plan for pain management because it was making me stay away from work it was so painful.\n\nHe has now prescribed me a cortisone topical cream and an antibiotic called Septra for one week to take down the inflammation. Apparently my body is having an inflammatory reaction this time around. He also took me back down to 10mg per day instead of 30mg to see. \n\nI searched and searched the internet for anyone else who has had this problem because I cant find anyone who has had this level of pain during this purging process.

Only useful for major depressive episodes**\n\n* **Wellbutrin (Buproprion) has worked very well for depression, but always triggers a bad manic episode after a couple of months and I have to stop**\n\n* **If I am under a lot of pressure at work, the combination of 36 - 54mg of Concerta and ten joints a day helps me produce amazing work, but it is super unhealthy. I\'m not currently working, smoking pot or taking Concerta.**\n\n* **Anticonvulsants lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine have helped with mood swings, but I am unable to focus**\n\n* **Ketogenic diet has helped with brain-fog, but it has not been the magic bullet I\'ve been looking for (although I did lose 50 pounds)**\n\n\nI\'m 40 years and was put on **40mg of Ritalin** when I was around 6 or 7. That amount was raised to **60mg** when I was 11. I was taken off it suddenly when I entered HS, because that\'s what they did back then.\n\nAfter years of study problems at college, I started taking it again around age 20, this time taking it as needed, in **5 or 10mg** dosages, typically **20mg a day** but as much as **30mg** if I had a lot of studying. For whatever reason, I\'ll stop taking it after some time. Maybe my insurance changed or I felt it was just making me too edgy, but I always stop and then I start to have problems with work (I am a programmer, I need to focus). \n\nI started **smoking pot on a daily basis** around the age of 23, which helped me focus and and reduced my anxiety, but over time, it creates more anxiety as I\'d be constantly worried about running out, running to pick up, etc. It is a bank-account draining, PiTA and given the volume that I need to smoke when I smoke, it\'s better to not smoke at all. \n\nI struggled a bit with controlling my cannabis use in my late 20s/early 30s. I\'d feel better not smoking, but I would get very, very depressed and occasionally have a manic episode. \n\nI thought maybe I was addicted to cannabis and that these were withdrawal symptoms. I went cold turkey for 3 years and began exercising intensely and the symptoms only got worse. \n\nBy this point, I had tried a few **SSRIs**. I would take them out of desperation, they\'d get me out of my funk, but after a while I would just feel like a vegetable and I would have to stop taking them.\n\nThe doctor I saw suggested I try **Wellbutrin**. Almost immediately, I felt ""normal"". It gave me a lot of energy, also, but the energy would just keep growing and growing until I would snap and do something harmful to myself like throw my bicycle at the wall because of some perceived insult. He tried pairing it with **Lamictal** to stabilize my mood, but that didn\'t work.\n\nI stopped taking the **Wellbutrin**, and I went on **Concerta**. I was hesitant, but the doctor really upsold it. It worked very well, with some caveats:\n\n* It was brand new, so there was no generic and I knew I was getting the best quality drug\n* It still had the anxiety inducing side effects that had me resorting to cannabis to balance out. \n* I don\'t like being on it all day and would rather take as needed. **36mg** is not enough and **54mg** is too much and my insurance won\'t cover any more than 1 pill a day, so 27mg once or twice a day is not an option.\n\nThis was about five years ago or so, and I\'ve been caught in this loop of giving up and going back.\n\nI\'ve lost a lot of faith in the medical profession, especially the mental health wing. For years, doctors have been telling me to eat low-fat, lots of grains, blabbity blah blah. I\'d been vegetarian on an off most of my adult life, overweight my entire life and up until about 10 months ago, I had been on a vegan diet. The vegan diet caused my triglycerides to skyrocket and I became pre-diabetic. I discovered the **ketogenic diet** and figured, why not? It couldn\'t get any worse.\n\nTen months later I am 50lbs lighter and all of my blood work is within a normal range. I eat bacon and eggs almost every day, fatty steaks, butter, bone broths, liver (yuk!), all these things I was told to eat sparingly. **IMHO, most doctors in America are only in it for the money and are reading from a script, like any other mediocre salesman.** I have a bit of a bias, as my grandfather was an OB/GYN who had grown up in poverty and often worked for free, and would often lament the steep ethical decline the profession had taken over the course of his life.\n\nI have been more or less managing my mental health through general practitioners over the years, telling them what I want. I\'ve kind of hit a wall with this.\n\n\n**This is what I understand about myself:** \n\n* I respond well to drugs that affect **dopamine** and **norepinephrine** levels. Drugs that operate on **serotonin** seem to make me vegetative and unmotivated and give me a false sense of happiness. \n* Too much **norepinephrine** and I will have a manic episode\n* **adderall** feels to me like **speed**, and **ritalin** does not. As I understand it, the difference between the two is that **Ritalin** acts as a **reuptake inhibitor** for these **neurotransmitters**, whereas **Adderall** provides a substitute for them. [[Reference]](http://www.progressivehealth.com/ritalin-adderal.htm)\n* **Adderall** and **Ritalin** both make me edgy, although I seem to get a lot more done on the Ritalin. \n* Cannabis helps me focus, which is atypical of most people, but not atypical of programmers.  I imagine cannabis figured heavily into the creation of reddit.\n* No [Ballmer Peak](http://xkcd.com/323/) for me, however. One sip of alcohol and my brain completely fogs up and I am useless and my ADHD symptoms skyrocket. My worst manic episodes have been under the influence of alcohol, so I try and avoid it altogether. \n\n\nMore recently, I have started **DBT**  and my therapist suggested that internet porn may be rotting my mind. This news kind of bowled me over. I\'m a guy, I get distracted by me needs, and I try and satisfy them as quickly as possible so I can get back to work. The **Adderall** especially tends to increase my sex drive (as did the **Wellbutrin**) and sometimes I would **fap** 3 - 5 times a day. The reading I\'ve done suggests that all that **fapping** combined with the visual stimuli may be affecting **dopamine** levels. I am experimenting with abstaining from porn, but it made me think about how sometimes I would **fap** first thing in the morning if I couldn\'t get out of bed, because it would give me energy. Perhaps it gave me a burst of dopamine that would propel me into the shower, I don\'t know.\n\nI will dig through the archives, but any immediate thoughts on **Modafinil**?\n'"

The day where everyone quits their jobs or offs themselves (and not how does it feel to treat me like you do ). I was one of them. Off-ing myself, not leaving a job as Im immersed in student-hood once again at the ripe age of 34. I spent the day ejecting, self destructing, clearing the cobwebs of niceties from my mind, being a rude shit to my friends, slamming the proverbial door in their faces and doing all I could to shut out the light from the world. God knows, I am tired of the light.\n\nAll of my sins, my self hatred, my disgust, lay before me. No room on the table for anything good. Positivity, the coward in the gloom at the back of my mind, buried deep in the pain and the fire of depression.\n\nAbout depression: it is a shadow. A shadow that is measured not in metres but in years, always following, always there, attached at my feet under every step. It waxes and wanes with the intensity of light cast upon it, and that depends on those complicated chemical reactions in my brain which control how far the shutter blinds open and how much light creeps into the room. Those reactions have been out of balance since I was born and tonight, I wish more than ever that I hadnt been.\n\nMy thoughts of those who love me are too far away to call to mind. Nothing feels real or tangible right now. I am watching this play out behind a glass screen like some petulant child glued to a TV. The medication I am on is successful in removing my crippling anxiety and has allowed that un-watched pot boiling on the gas stove to spit and bubble over. Sadly, the medication doesnt touch the sides when it comes to my other issues. Its like taking morphine for a broken leg, in that you no longer feel the pain but you can sure as hell run a marathon and do yourself ten-times the damage. You dont notice until youve crossed the finish line and can see the bone sticking right through the flesh. These issues are an unchained guard dog roaming free in the yard, foaming at the mouth and baring teeth. But now the gate is open and its free to mingle with the hopes and dreams and intricate nuances of everyday life.\n\nAnd so that pot boils over. The insurmountable weight of gravity sucks the water down the side of the pan into the gas flame and it vapourises instantly. I am raging now, I cannot see though my eyes are open. That proverbial TV is at the other side of the room, my life beyond it, and I am being dragged backward across the carpet. My hands are shaking and the skin on my chest is tighter than a tribal drum as if it will somehow burst wide open and the sheer might of my anger will spill out into the room, laying waste to all it touches.\n\nSo I drink to numb the pain. I drink to stay the demons, to feel anything else but me for just one tiny, little, second. I drink so I can breathe and have the feeling of air in my lungs overtake the wrenching ache. One. Two. Three beers, that half a bottle of whisky from the cupboard, the white wine on the side  I drink it room temperature. It all goes straight down. Sweet poison. All within an hour or so. But the solace it brings is short lived, the calm before the storm. The metabolism of the alcohol somehow, unsurprisingly, exacerbates the whirlwind in my brain. Its the perfect storm and I am lost at sea.\n\nMAKE.\nIT.\nSTOP.\n\nIts been about 20 years since I last tied a noose, Google refreshes my memory and I laugh defiantly at the large banners on every instructional website that state if youre considering tying a noose because youre having suicidal thoughts and need immediate help coping, please call emergency services such as 911 or 999 or a suicide hotline. Glossed over in my drunken stupor. I tie it anyway. The NHS Crisis Team hotline number saved in my phone is the friend Ive lost touch with and feel weird about calling. So I dont.\n\nMy flat has no stairs, the common hallway is secluded but its still public, same as the balcony. I need privacy, no one to stop and look on, to find me, to film it on their phones for their vacuous, self-absorbed Instagram or YouTube fiction. I want silence. Peace. Finally.\n\nI go to the exercise tower in my bedroom. The tower that Ive used to keep my body trim and my mind sharp, that Ive used to fight through the darkness when times were hard. The tower that will be the last thing I cling to on this earth. I secure the rope to the top hand holds with a round turn and two half-hitches. My fingers baulk at the coldness of the metal holds. The noose now swings gently and settles against the stillness of the air. I am unhappy with the resting height so I readjust the top knot. A testing tug with my hand and the rope confides in me that it can do the job.\n\nI turn, looking through the door to the living room, the magnificent vista gracing my eyes, and slip the noose over my head, the knot resting on the nape of my neck. It is as heavy as the endless night I find myself in, as heavy as my burden upon the world. No thoughts of my time and travels, my loves and achievements, those times that I have been a good person. Only this second exists, right now. Despair, loneliness. My legs slump and I feel the tightness around my neck. I give no time to thought any more, no poignant mindful farewell, no parting scribbles on a scrap of paper, no feeling anything at all other than the anger driving my body forward against the rope. I lean into it with such conviction that I fear the fibres might shred and snap as they creak like a shipyard junker tugging against the tide and the quay. But it holds firm. Each millimetre of my skin beneath the rope being crushed and chaffed and crumpled. It gives me as much slack, as much room for error, as much forgiveness as I have allowed myself in thirty-four years. My brain fizzles and static forms in the moments between what my eyes see and my brain processes. This heart in my chest accelerates its beating: I wish it had never begun to in the first place. Numbness creeps into my hands and face. I can feel my lips spitting parts of themselves out into the world as blood throbs around my body. My legs lose their will to hold my body from the floor, this burden now belongs solely to the noose. The static takes hold with a furtive permanence and I can no longer breath even the most simple molecules of air. I feel my mind flipping over to the dreamy softness of the dark, so gentle and calm against the whirring chaos of the light. Glass-like thick, black water. Moving soft and slow.\n\nIve longed to still the waters all my life. And now I am finally here, beginning to drift in that blissful sea.\n\nBut. I stop.\n\nMy legs fight again for their right to hold me, the blood throbs through thighs and skin and bone. My heart smashing its fists against the walls of my chest from deep within my muscles. I stand and my arms lift instinctively to loosen the rope that is still burning into my neck. It takes considerable effort and concentration to ease the knot. I am dizzy. I breathe deep, for only a few seconds. Why? I do not know, there is no fear here. Not any more. I want this. Still the waters. Welcome the dark.\n\nSo, I try again. I lean into the rope as hard as I can until I am losing consciousness. More this time. Take me, please take me. But the instinct in my legs betrays me once again and I stand. Fuck it. I take the noose from my neck in annoyance and anger and frustration. The moment becomes too much. I feel the worn threads of the carpet come up to meet my face. The childish red wetness of my cheeks stinging against polyester fibres of the floor covering. A cheap grave this wouldve made indeed.\n\nI am ashamed. This truly is the darkest of winters.\n\nI dont know what I was expecting. Some relief, some shining light. Some kind of cleansing. But all I am left with is me. Just me. The same me whom my friends and my family love, who wishes for only peace and love in the world. The same me who wishes to leave all that behind, to drop it where it lay and walk away, but I cant. I am still not sure what ethereal tether holds me to this earth. Some invisible force which holds its hands up to death and says No. No. Not today. Not right now. Truthfully, life just then goes on. It feels the same as its always felt. I expected some emotional recovery period but there never is one. I took my car to the garage for repairs. I met my friend for a pub lunch. I did do something differently this time, though I told my friends. I did not hide away from the light. I dont tell my parents. I still havent. They are the most wonderful people and have supported me in so many ways for which I am enternally grateful, but they are not built for this. They are not equiped to deal with me in this way and that is ok. You cannot be something youre not. I am at peace with that.\n\nI used to wonder why no one listens until youve tried to kill yourself? Is it that were just empty threats until were too much to deal with? Too real and far removed from this nice comfy bubble. Ive been told plenty of times that Im not unwell enough for support  its easy to ignore the truth if you arent listening. But, in fairness, I am a liar. A very good one. I lie to myself and everyone around me. I lie so I do not have to face the truth, so I do not have to feel anything. Life for me is the pill that catches in the throat, most of the time I choke on it until I am blue in the face. But sometimes I cough it up along with the parts of myself I cannot bear to see, spilling myself, unwelcome, out into the world. We are supposed to keep quiet, hiding some kind of taboo but its a taboo thats covered in sand, either sinking under its own weight or exposing itself to the sky like some fraud when the wind shifts. Where was my support? What do I have to do to get that? Why did I go through all of this feeling so alone? Surely the doctors attitude that teenagers often get mental health issues because they are traversing the formative years is, for the most part, complete crap. Yes, there are hormonal changes but if its that bad then isnt it because the system is broken? Is this when the creativity gets beaten out of you for good, the last smoke tails curling upwards from the dying embers of the freedom youth allows us. The finishing touches of schooling hardening the clay before that brutal injection into the veins of the working world. Keep the poison coming. Hammer in the pieces until they fit. This time its different. I am no longer prepared to lie. Not to myself. Not to those whom I love. I am trying to be honest. I am trying not to be ashamed. Ashamed to be alive, to feel emotions, to have an illness as legitimate as a broken leg or a terminal disease, or ashamed to live with my mistakes and wrongdoings. I love my friends. I am grateful for them. They have unkowingly held the broken peices of me together for so long. I know now that I have discredited them by not being honest and not telling them of my struggles. I am learning. I am not afraid to do that anymore.\n\nI am speaking now. Loud and clear. But the truth is I dont think anyone is ever really listening. I am not looking for a mountain to move or an epiphany of the masses, rushing toward me with big open arms to sweep me up with a comforting hug. I am not weak or looking for attention or someone to hold me upright as my legs give way under the weight of the world. Just someone to listen to those nuances, those tiny disturbances from tiny butterfly wings beating against the air. But the silent signals of mental illnesses too easily go unnoticed in those countless 6-minute, overworked-doctors appointments: condescending, dismissive, playing it down so they dont have to acknowledge the product of a broken society, so they dont have to deal with the ugly condition of the human mind, so perpetually dragging us down. Youre just a little sad, everybody gets sad sometimes. I dont blame them. Even the best workers in the world palm-off tasks they are not equipped to deal with, be it through exhaustion or uninterest or lack of time. So the difficulty of diagnosing something so complex in an appointment in which you only have sufficient time to sit down and remove your coat before putting it back on again and leaving with a prescription for a preferred SSRI or broad-spectrum antibiotic is not unbelievable. Quite normal, in fact. Ive palmed-off many things in my working life which I havent been equipped or bothered to deal with. So, prescribing medication to make us conform somehow  amoxicillin, penicillin, Setraline, Prozac, coffee, alcohol, consumerism, sex, its all the same. It all allows us to function when were running on empty. Save those few amazing people, friends and professionals who CAN help, this is just brushed off like a passing fly. And why wouldnt it be? We do the same to those with broken bones or cancer. Wish them well and carry on with our own lives. There is no fault there, we fill our lives with such business (busy-ness), such stress, we barely have time for ourselves, without making the time for others and their difficulties. Too much weight and you topple over. Something needs to change, somewhere. We need to stop putting sticking plasters over a gunshot wound, we need to stop the bullet being fired in the first place. Why can no one see this?\n\nAfterwards, I had a call with the Point of Entry Team within the NHS mental health services. I had the sense to realise I was in a bad way over a month before and got the GP to refer me to them (finally, a successful appointment  the squeaky wheel gets the oil, it would seem). I was brutally honest for the first time in my life about my illness, no hiding bits of me away, no shame. It was a long call but it was worth it. The psychologist was excellent. What a difficult job she does every day. One of many whom I will meet on this journey that are on the receiving end of the ramblings of broken minds each day, whom I am eternally grateful toward and for whom I have unwavering respect. We talk like friends do. We talk like people with a common goal, in search of something better from the grit and the dirt we grew up in. She tells me I have strong bipolar traits. She tells me to call the crisis team if I decide to try to take my life again. I tell her I will but I know, and she knows, that when that plane is going down it crashes quickly and sometimes you just stare at the rocks in front of you, hurtling toward your face, and you just cant think to find the parachute.\n\nStrangely, this is my break in the traffic. Allowing me to cross to a better side where I can walk in the sunshine. It feels like a cold shower waking the senses. Nothing she tells me is new but it feels good for someone give me a hand toward a proper diagnosis. Turns out Im more than just a little bit sad.\n\nThe condition: The mania I feel is like a gnat or a fly buzzing incessantly, crashing into the walls of my brain. Some days its like running through stinging nettles. Its everywhere, every inch of skin tingling. Feverish. The elation is insuppressible. I am king in my own world. I am the mighty warrior, defeating all which stands in my path. I create, seemingly endlessly, a river of ideas flowing from my mind, words falling in great torrents from my mouth. Nothing can happen quick enough. I want to run free, to wherever, no matter how far, no consequence. I will go fast and strident into the breaking day and will not slow down or cease until night, when only the body stops but the mind races on. Sleep will not grace me and when it does it is as vivid and intense as the waking day rushing past me. Everything is at warp speed. I am so agitated that I cannot sit still and the slightest inconvenience makes me feel like bursting from my clothes, Hulk-like, and smashing through the world in front of my eyes. The drugs, the sex, the rock and roll just melts into one of many blurry gaps in my memory, sloshing from side to side in the stark, disconnected hangover of a manic episode. Over time, the flip-flop of emotions continues and I begin to find calm. And for a few days after about 6-8 weeks in I am clear-headed, conscious, alert, level, what you would call NORMAL, and then the fear creeps back in like those imminent thoughts of unwanted just-watched horror movie ghosts in the dead of night. In every corner of the room, the light fading fast around you, under the bed, in the wardrobe. No parent to comfort you and no duvet to wrap yourself tight in to protect you from the things that go bump in the night and make you feel like everything is going to be alright. What an exhausting life this is, to be continuously pulled apart by those horses. One called mania, one called depression.\n\nOver the next few weeks I sink lower and lower. That emotional submarine seeking deeper, darker worlds where the weight of your own mind is too heavy for your body to lift from the bed and the thought of moving an inch is akin to climbing Everest. Exaggerating I am not. I turn the key over in the ignition but the engine doesnt fire. I wear the darkness like a cloak around me, soft, comforting, and sickly. And so the cycle continues. Rinse and repeat Rebuilding myself and those relationships that I have thrown against the wall in anger and broken each and every time. I am immensely guilty for my actions, for my words, for the consequences of my existence.\n\nI visit the psychiatrist. She is a wonderful being with a keen ear and a calm demeanour. I feel much better, naturally, with some distance between this visit and the event. My cycles are changing and I have some energy to exist, now. Because of that, I feel like a fraud, like I shouldnt be here. And that every breath I take is stolen from someone else. Someone deserving. But I am here and I have been writing down how I feel each day so I no longer have the luxury of dishonesty, explaining it away and pretending it isnt me, it isnt real, it is just a warped memory. Not today, dear boy. Today is justified. We sit, she talks, I talk, we both listen. Not just to each other but to the ebb and flow of feelings and emotions that spill forth into the air. I feel better getting all this off my chest. She tells me I have either bipolar type 2 or cyclothymia (a milder form of bipolar), but she cant give me a formal diagnosis without a review in 4-months time, after I have been clean for 6 months. I am very careful to say have and not am. This is an illness, it does not define me. You are not your stubbed toe or your broken arm, you are not your wheelchair or your skin colour or your job that you may love or despise. I explain I have spent many years clean but she wants to be certain, given the complexity of her craft, and I respect that. I now have a reason to stop abusing my mind and body. I am grateful for the carrot at the end of a stick.\n\nIn truth, were all ill. Its just by how much?. Ive just got a little less of what this broken society deems acceptable and controllable. And how ill must we be to stray so far from the symbiosis of nature and its processes. Creating our beliefs in fictitious things like money and security. Were all completely fucking mental.\n\nWhat truly matters is being in nature and not knowing names for everything but knowing what place and what role it has on this earth. To know this in our souls because it is in our genes, pulsing through our veins with every kick of the heart. Connected. Something we will never ever know. Not to the bone. We are not designed for bricks and mortar and office chairs and sitting in traffic swearing at the mostly-empty cars in front whilst slowly poisoning ourselves as we suck on the billowing, black exhaust pipe smoke. I want none of it, thank you. I have never felt consistently better than when Ive been in touch with nature, out in the world and amongst the trees and calling birds. Isnt it time to actually live a little bit? Isnt it time to reject the ideals presented to us as statute?Isnt it time to cut the fat from the world? Working your best, most able years just to retire in a big house with nothing to do,  nothing you are able to do, and have the brain fade away and die in front of the eyes of your family members so you can bequeath to them a larger portion of that fictitious belief system. What a joke this all is. Im not ashamed to say that and I feel better and stronger and richer for it. I know now it does not, and will not bring me happiness, or peace.\n\nMy point is, I am becoming comfortable within myself and in living the life that I want to live. With that, the cycles will be more manageable, I will be able to function in my own way. I have hope. A hope Ive never felt before. I will have bad days, and bad weeks, but these are just sticks floating by in that proverbial river. I am learning what I love and doing more of it. And doing less of what I despise. And in this hope that I am holding with fear and excitement like a father does with a newborn child, I know that you will see hope, too, for yourselves and your futures. Never be ashamed to be you. Were all ill and we cant all fit into the same mould. I hope that those without a mental illness will read this and gain a little insight into what it is like to have an illness as legitimate as a broken leg or cancer. So when you meet someone who is just a little sad, know that they may be at the end. And you might save their life by listening to them. Remember that everyone is different and your reality is not everyone elses. Remember that those people who have broken bones, or wheelchairs, or cancers, or poor mental health are numerous. Were not alone. Youre not alone. Educate. Speak. Listen. People are dying from poor mental health but we do not need to. It can be survived. Managed. Healed. Beaten. Remembered. And respected.\n\nAll I needed to do is talk about it honestly. I am so thankful for such wonderful friends and professionals to help me through. I trust in them.\n\nJP Collins'"

EXCEPT that when i have the rash, my taste buds on the back of my tongue are swollen because im unable to use my tongue scraper without pain and discomfort. when the rash first starts, they almost feel like theyre oozing. when they start to heal, they seem dry, almost like eczema or something, and in order to get the dead layer of skin off, i have to exfoliate or in extreme cases, literally use tape to peel the dead skin off. when its particularly bad (like now) my lips also swell. \n\ni really hope someone is able to help. it makes it very uncomfortable to talk, eat, move my mouth, kiss my wife, do anything at all. its also unsightly and embarrassing and inconvenient. i just wish i understood what it was. i have tried allegra, benadryl, aloe, eczema creams, cold sore creams, and probably other stuff too over the years. nothing has worked. i have not been able to have a dermatologist look at it because it goes away faster than they can fit me in. \n\nthank you for reading, please please comment with any ideas suggestions or thoughts. im at a loss. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/cP1None'"

Advil eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/x67cjo/sleep_and_death_anxiety/,b'Sleep and Death Anxiety',,"b""Hey everyone I'm new to this community and wanted to share my thoughts on something I've been going through: \n\nI have dealt with death anxiety to a crippling extent on and off for several years, starting in my mid teens for a few years, then rearing it's ugly head again when I'd all but forgotten the crippling experience, within weeks of me giving birth to my beautiful second child, a boy. Both times it reared its ugly head just as I was closing my eyes for an evening of rest. \n\nSo here's what I think is going on, I fight the urge to sleep, heavily. Why? Idk. With my death fear and anxiety comes depression, a lack of hunger, a lack of desire to just exist in the day, at its height I'd spend all day waiting to sleep, or wanting to sleep because I didn't want to feel these feelings anymore. But when the night came with each phase of exhaustion that washed over me I just couldn't close my eyes, I needed help, so I would take a sleeping aid like Midol PM or Advil PM or Benadryl after watching TikTok or TV mindlessly for usually hours to dissociate. \n\nI'm only recently becoming aware of this correlation but it's a definitive theme for me. Well no sooner did this issue dawn on me then an article shows up on my feed connecting disrupted circadian rhythms to mental illness. \n\nSo how did I becoke aware of this in myself? Well I started looking into Buddhism and other eastern teachings, my thought process was Christianity isn't helping me right now and materialism and scientific reductionsim isn't either or my SSRIs would be working. \n\nMy thought was this: Every night I drift off to sleep and sometimes I dream and sometimes I don't but I always wake up the next morning. If there's nothing after this life then that's okay, because sleep is nice and peaceful. It's hard to fully accept that as a young person but life helps us all towards the end to see this. Death is not the opposite of life but the opposite of birth. But then I stopped- \n\nIf I really feel that way about death, why do I fight so hard with sleep? Knowing full well I will in fact wake up the next day? How can I accept death when I can't even accept sleep?\n\nWell that I can't answer. I don't know what came first, my mental illness? My sleep issue? Who can say? I like sleep, as a young mother, I need it, I don't have nightmares often, a few series of them as a very young child, but overall I've had lots of good dreams too. \n\nSo I ask you all, have you noticed a similar correlation in your life on your own mental health journey? How correlated do you think these two things are? \n\nI'm going to try to accept sleep more often, and I hope that helps me in accepting other things that are natural and healthy like dying. If you have any tips on overcoming my resistance to rest without drugs let me know! \n\nhttps://neurosciencenews.com/circadian-rhythm-mental-health-21347/"""

I also have alternated Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen, as well as a 5 day course of Tylenol-3s that I stopped taking on day 3 (03/20/23).\n\nMy issue started last night (03/21/22), I dont know if its correlated but I did my normal salt rinse after eating, and noticed a rapid onset of a sore/scratchy throat almost immediately after I had finished. I though this may have been Dry Throat, from too much sodium concentrate and decided to intake 4 glasses of 8oz water before bed and a cup of tea for relief. Minimal change from original pain and I had issues sleeping due to this. \n\nWoke up this morning to what felt like razors being pushed down my throat every time I swallow. Literally just started bawling my eyes out because If wisdom teeth pain wasnt enough, this pain was now doubled and my tonsils are swollen. \n\nWent to Urgent Care and was strep tested, covid tested, and my tonsils were checked for any infection. All came back negative and I was told to finish antibiotic course and use a Lidocaine Mouthwash for numbing my throat pain. Was told if issue persists/worsens I should see my primary care doctor in 2-3 days. \n\nMy question is when I called my dentist this morning they would not even see me because Sore throat is not related to wisdom teeth extraction and I need to see a doctor for an option. But when I look online, many practices mention sore throat and scratchy feeling when swallowing post Wisdom teeth extraction. \n\nCould this possibly be a side effect of my wisdom teeth or an infection caused by the healing process? \n\nShould I call my dentist back and let them know what urgent care said and request to be seen again for the pain? \n\nHave anyone dealt with this/Has any dentist heard of this before and could weigh in on what I am possibly dealing with?\n\n\nMore Info : \nA couple hours after UC I have began to notice a lot of thick mucus drainage in my mouth, as well as in the back of my throat. I also developed a runny nose. \n\nFirst thought goes to sinus infection but as mention in a comment, I am unsure if this is even correlated with my wisdom teeth anymore since I have my bottom set extracted recently, and most sinus infections are associated with the top set. \n\nIs it possible to develop a sinus infection if my teeth are on the bottom? Or could I have develop this issue from my top set being extracted 4/2 weeks ago (top left side 4 weeks post op/ top right side 2 weeks post op) \n\nSinus pressure is also noticeable, but not painful, just a normal clogged nose.\n\n1 WEEK UPDATE : \n\nI was diagnosed with a sinus infection, took a couple rounds of Mucinex the first couple of days and started feeling WAY better. Did end up giving the infection to my boyfriend but he didnt get his wisdom teeth out so its been easier on him. \n\nAs far as an update to my teeth are concerned, I ended up having to go back to the dentist after I wasnt contagious anymore due to experiencing 1-3 hours of dull aching pain on the right side of my extraction site all the way to my front canines, sometimes however the pain would present itself in sharp intense shooting pains as well. It would linger even with Tylenol and ibuprofen combo, and only finally feel calm after I would ice my face and place ice cubes in my mouth for extended periods of time. \n\nTurns out I have been pushing a Bone Spur out of my right extraction site thats creating insane pain around my jaw / extraction. The pain on my bottom teeth adjacent to the extraction have either been going through sympathetic pain  due to the increased pressure around the area, but I also might have temporary damage to my trigeminal nerve, which could also be creating the dull ache I feel and sharp pains. \n\nAll in all, im still glad I got my wisdom teeth out but even after I made an effort to do the procedure and follow all the guidelines after, I still ended up with a couple complications that I had no idea were associated with Wisdom Teeth Extractions (excluding the sinus infection)\n\nI guess my best advice based on my experience would be do your research before the procedure so you know what signs are presenting themselves for all the different types of complications that show up after a wisdom tooth removal, and just call your dentist if you dont know!!!'"

cialis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/uavhgn/side_effects_after_stopping_treatment_anyone_need/,"b'Side Effects After stopping treatment, anyone? Need some help here.'",,"b""I had to stop my second course of Isotreitonin (30gr for roughly 1 month) because of some bad side effects like diarrhea, abdominal/muscle pain, depression and loss of libido. It's now 1 month I stopped and I still experience this:\n\n-Bad back pain, which gets a lot worse when I sit\n-A feeling of numbness/tickling in my legs, hips, thighs and butt. I feel weakness in my lower muscles, I have difficult standing still some days, especially when I wake up\n-Still very poor libido and erectile dysfunction. There's very little activity down there since I took this pill and still going on. Can't get hard 70% of times even if I masturbate. Max I can get is some soft erections that really don't feel normal. Plus I feel this constant discomfort/tingling in my prepuce area. I'm not really fucntional right now. I take 5mg Cialis and does better, but even with that I have some difficult getting one good hard on. Things are not normal for real.\n-The worst anxiety and mood swings I've ever had in all my life. I pass from crying to feel better from one day to the other. I think my actual sexual problems play a huge role on this. Honestly, I cannot feel good mentally if my comrade doesn't work at 21 yo.\n-Brain fog and feeling tired constantly. More like an hopeless, only want to sleep thing. Just I don't feel like myself, you know?\n-Since I had diarrhea while on the pills, after I stopped them, it's 1 month I'm constipated. Like, I can't take a shit if at least 2 or 3 days don't pass. Before, I took a dump almost 2 times a day. I also feel this dull pain in my lower abdomen in the left, I think may have colitis, but it's strange to me it goes on for almost a month. I didn't took any drug for It, because it usually goes away by his own when I get It.\n\nThis Is pretty much all, I'm having a really hard time at the Moment, especially from a mental side. I don't know anymore if these symptoms are gonna subside or ruin me forever. I just don't feel myself anymore like this. Obviously, my sexual problems are what is giving me the most distress. In one month I passed from masturbating 2 times a day at struggling to even get it up.\nI took the drug for almost a month and after these side effects appeared, I instantly stopped. But this was my second course, I did another one 3 years ago of 4 months with the same dosage and nothing bad happened, a part from some dryness and fatigue. It's 1 month now I stopped and all these side effects are lasting. What's your idea on this? Did you also experience similar lasting side effects for months, also after stopping the pill? Will they subside with time? Any sexual related problems? I'm freaking out bad for this. I can't think of being not sexually functional for the rest of my life and I can't bare anymore this numbness and discomfort I have in my body. Also these mood swings are killing my daily productivity, almost lost my job for this. Really need some advice on this or your experience with it. My doc said these can't give sexual related problems and that this side effects usually subsides few weeks after stopping the treatment. But here I am, 1 month after, still half broken. Also saw an andrologist, said my blood flow is regular and made me do blood work for hormones, will have the response in few days. Will also have another blood work on 30th to check my general health."""

I cannot take Tylenol due to liver damage and cannot take NSAIDs due to genetic mutations and interactions with bipolar medication. I tried prednisone for my pain a few weeks ago. I asked my rheumatologist if it was safe for me to take prednisone with bipolar and be assured me it was, but it indeed was not. I had mild psychosis after a few days of it so I stopped it. At my visit last week he prescribed me Tramadol. I asked him again if this was okay to take with bipolar, he assured me it was, but when I look it up online it says it acts on serotonin receptors and can cause mania. I know through genetic testing and personal experience that any serotonin-affecting medications really throw me off emotionally. Ive been taking it for a few days now and am responding really well to it, but Im afraid one day Ill just snap and be manic or psychotic. Im losing hope that all my problems will ever be fully managed. I dont want to keep taking the Tramadol if its going to negatively affect my psychology (not taking about addiction) but I am hesitant to try a different opiate with less serotonin activity (because of addiction potential). Ideally I was hoping I would be prescribed gabapentin for my pain because then I could possibly wean off my Xanax, since gabapentin treats anxiety as well as pain. What should I do?'"

dilaudid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/jb6w0n/bone_graft_failing/,b'Bone graft failing?',,"b'I had a dental bone graft 8 days ago.  The extraction was difficult, taking my dentist about 1.5 hours.  The graft is from a cadaver.  I got sutures with a membrane covering.  I was put on clindamycin from day 1, cause there\'s a possibility I\'m allergic to amoxicillin.  I had normal pain/discomfort immediately after the procedure, but over the last week i began having increasingly more pain. It got to the point that dilaudid wouldn\'t even help.  I couldn\'t work or do anything,  really.\n  \nI had my 1 week follow-up yesterday, and to no surprise it was infected.  My dentist removed the sutures and membrane and cleaned out the area.  She filled it with some material that _should_ have stopped the pain right away (if it was a dry socket).  It provided no pain relief after 20min or so, so she concluded the graft is being rejected and scheduled me for graft removal today. She also upped my clindamycin to double the dose and gave me a pain killer.\n  \nI took 1 pain killer as soon as i left the dentist yesterday afternoon, but then the pain never returned.  I took no more pain killers, Advil, or any other pain medicine.  I ate (a soft) dinner without issue and fell asleep with no pain.  So i cancelled the graft removal at the suggestion of my dentist (since i had no more pain).\n  \nThis morning it felt a little sore again, but i still didn\'t take any pain medicine.  But now, at 2:45pm, it seems to be increasing in pain yet again.  Its not yet as bad as before.  I\'m reluctant to even call it ""pain"" at this point.  But it\'s distracting from work...its a dull ache.  I carefully brushed my teeth and used the Rx mouth wash with no relief... Just took a pain killer again so i can get some work done.\n  \nIs it possible that my body is still rejecting this graft?

Going on for about three years now. Manifests as sharp pain in penis and increasingly deep burning with occasional tingling in the perineal or deep groin area (lets say behind the testicles), somewhat down my inner thigh as well. It gets worse with sexual stimulation, stretching of the groin and similar things. Sometimes there is a sharp pain with stop/starting urination (like a pain when the ""valve"" switches off and on), but not always. Some minor urinary incontinence.\n\nEdit:\nForgot to mention: Been to ER, urology (multiple), recently an orthopedic surgeon, primary care, pelvic floor physical therapy. They\'ve done most of what you\'d expect. Testicle US, cystoscopy, blood tests, STD tests\n\nHow I\'ve been managing:\nI have struggled greatly with this issue, it can be extremely debilitating at times, and it\'s not clear exactly what the cause is. In the past I have gotten some relief from taking Clonazepam, but my psych took me off of it because I was taking it too much for her liking (0.5 mg about 5 times a week). After being removed from Clonazepam, I fell into alcohol to deal with the pain and it devolved into a real problem. Recently, while detoxing off of alcohol, I\'ve been taking Clonazepam from a friend to help with withdrawals. I\'m managing it very carefully as I know the risk of addiction can be high, but it is safer for me than alcohol and I\'m taking the risk. Not asking a doctor to condone this. \n\nQuestion part:\nI\'ve found that this also helps with my pain to a good extent. I was wondering what a doctor thought about the mechanism at play here with regard to Clonazepam and the pain relief. Are you inclined to believe it\'s just reducing my stress and anxiety and therefore helping the pain, or is it the muscle relaxant effects at work? I have tried Flexeril, but it doesn\'t do much. I am considering asking my doctor for a new type, more potent muscle relaxer (non-addictive of course -- they probably wouldn\'t give me valium with my history with alcohol). Baclofen comes to mind. Any other thoughts on this matter?\n\nExtra detail:\nI have CPPS and recently been detoxing off of alcohol and the pain has spiked horribly. I had a stash of Clonazepam with I was avoiding using. However, out of desperation I took a small amount and it was very helpful for my pain and my withdrawal symptoms. This also helps my pain when I had a legit script and at that time I hadn\'t fallen as hard into alcohol yet.\n\nAnyway for more history, after I lost my original Clonazepam script, I had turned to alcohol as my own source of pain relief and it had spiraled out of control. After many half-hearted attempts, I had a major issue with my relationship and decided to quit. Quit for 10 days and the withdrawals were terrible and made my pain much worse. I ended up in the ER with heart palpitations and other symptoms of a heart issue. Ended up in an inpatient program against my will because I expressed to them that while I wasn\'t exactly acutely suicidal, so many doors have been closing on me with regard to resolving my pain that I had started worrying about more serious suicidal ideations in the future. After 4 days in this so-called voluntary problem, I suffered a lot through the withdrawals and heightened pain, but my pain did get slowly better and more manageable, but it is still somewhat volatile. I was detoxing without drug therapy except for something to manage my spike in blood pressure. In the end I am happy I ended up there since it gave a time where I could take medical leave and not worry about work, while also being forced to abstain from alcohol.\n\nSince I\'ve been out, I relapsed again on a day or two binge due to a subsequent spike in my pain. So where I\'m at is detoxing again, not as bad as the first time which put me in the hospital. As I said above, I\'m managing the pain and withdrawals myself with Clonazepam. I\'m very careful not to take these on the same day. I only take clonazepam on days where I haven\'t been drinking and I\'m starting to feel withdrawals. I know most won\'t be convinced and say this is unsafe, which is fair, but it\'s a calculated risk to maintain my sanity, manage my pain, and to keep the withdrawals at a manageable level. I was wondering what people\'s thoughts were with regard to how and why this is working for my pain?\n\nThanks'"

penicillin rash,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/11fhf8g/please_help_possible_amoxicillin_allergy/,b'Please help! - possible amoxicillin allergy',,"b'Hello, \nI have quite a few questions regarding my 1 year old daughter and I hope someone can provide some clarity. I have asked 2 pharmacists roughly the same questions but looking for more confirmation from allergists/people who suffer from this\n\nContext:\nMy daughter was prescribed a 5 day course of amoxicillin for an ear and chest infection on 7th of Feb. She had 1 dose that evening, another dose in the morning (8th of feb) and one at lunch time. This is the first time she has needed an antibiotic. Upon bathing her, I noticed bruising to her ears (where the GP held them to look inside) and her feet and ankles began to swell with really quite blue bruising to the top, in between toes, ankles and sole of her feet. She very regularly grabs these areas and bashes her ankles together with force and kicks her feet off the ground while she is lying down. I took her straight to A&E in a worry as she has never had a bruise before and there was no possible way this could have been inflicted and she is not yet mobile.\nWhile in hospital, more bruising of different sizing appeared to the back of her calves, knee, elbow, top of her arm, veins at the palms of her hand and the vein behind one of knees in the crease. All these bruises appeared at different stages during the night and whenever a different nurse checked her over. She started to develop lots of little purple/red spots to her legs, her arms and knees started to swell and her eczema patches became very red. The bruising started off so blue that one of the nurses tried scrubbing it off thinking it was ink or dye from her clothes. She continued to grab and bash her feet and ankles together causing the bruises to become worse. There was absolutely no tenderness or pain where any of the bruises were. \nNumerous tests were done such as x-rays, CT, and an extensive blood test checking platelets, organ function etc. But nothing appeared on anything. The hospital continued to give her amoxicillin and I am unsure if any more bruising appeared. I saw her on day 6/7? (13th of feb) after taking the first dose and all bruising, spots and swelling had gone apart from little green-coloured areas where the bruising was on her veins. The whole of her face where she did not have eczema was peeling/flaking and had clearly been moisturised. I saw her again on 17th of feb and she had an untextured, really red rash consisting of lots of little spots covering her whole stomach which she had never had before. The skin on her face was also back to normal. \nThe dr never considered the amoxicillin. After researching myself and going into a pharmacy and requesting a leaflet that comes with amoxicillin, I am beginning to realise she may of had a very rare reaction or side effects to it - leaflet states all these symptoms as a 1 in 10,000 chance. \n\nQuestions:\n1. Does this sound like a reaction? Or side effects? I am unsure of the difference.\n2. Would these reactions/side effects alter any results on an extensive blood test?\n3. Can this allergy be found in a blood test if not looking for it?\n4. If this is an allergy, how can she be tested for it? (Skin prick, specific blood test, etc?)\n5. If she takes amoxicillin again, what are the chances she has the same reaction? \n6.Are drug allergy symptoms different every time? Or is there a risk of her going into anaphylaxis the next time she takes it?\n7. Would this be an allergy of penicillin or just amoxicillin? (If it is an allergy or just side effects)\n8. If not an allergy, is there any safe way to prove these are side effects of amoxicillin?\n9.

I do not claim that this is a cure for every single mental health issue.\n4. I do not claim that these methods are the only alternative; there are other variations of therapy and diet that can help, as well.\n5. In conjunction with my diet and therapy, I have also incorporated many other forms of self-care protocols that have helped me in my healing journey, and continue to help me by keeping depression, stress and anxiety at bay. I will be sharing those methods on reddit soon. ............................................\n\n**Hey guys, I know this is a bit of a long post, but if you suffer from mental illness (especially depression/anxiety/PTSD/insomnia) then it might be worth a read:**\n\nWhen I was very sick (mentally), I knew the day would come when I would feel ""normal"" again. Even though it seemed impossible at the time, I never lost hope. And **I always promised myself that if I was able to dig myself out of that hell hole, I would share my story to hopefully inspire and help others in similar positions.** So here we go.\n\nIt all began when, out of boredom, I decided to travel abroad in the search of ""adventure"". I traveled to my home country (from Canada) and ended up falling in love. I ended up moving to said country, after this person ""proposed"" (he casually asked if I wanted to get married). My family, who lived in Canada in the U.S were horrified, but there was nothing anybody could do to stop me.\n\nThis ""charming bad boy"" who I fell blindly in love with ended up being an emotionally and psychologically abusive (and even physically and sexually abusive), lazy, momma\'s boy (we lived mostly with his mom who did *everything* for him) with a major drinking and drug problem. Many, many things happened in the 4 years I was with him, including physical and sexual abuse, constant emotional abuse/control/jealousy, etc...  I mean, I could write a book about it. I know now that I stayed with him because of my psychological relationship map that was formed from having an emotionally, physically, (and I suspect even sexually) abusive father. **All this resulted in me developing severe cases of clinical depression, anxiety, PTSD and even suicidal tendencies**. On top of that, I had many other instances of sexual abuse (rape) and physical assault happen to me that made my symptoms even worse.\n\n**My PTSD was so bad that I couldn\'t even talk to people, I couldn\'t leave the house, I couldn\'t talk on the phone, or do anything social without having a major panic attack and freezing**. It was literally impossible for me to do anything social without medication (as in, not even once). But after a near death experience (caused by neglect in that relationship), and being dumped by him, I finally ""woke up"" and returned to North America with a new outlook on life. Unfortunately I still had major PTSD and had to take medication to be able to even leave the house, but I had greater expectations for my life this time and would not settle for less.\n\nI unfortunately continued on the habits I picked up while abroad to cope with my issues. These habits included binge drinking on weekends (partying), smoking, and eating almost nothing but junk food to cope with my pain and anxiety. I had to take medication every single time I left the house, I was unable to hold down a job due to my mental issues, I had no social life whatsoever. Every! Single! Morning! upon waking up, I would have a few seconds of bliss before my PTSD symtoms would kick in: racing heart beat that felt like a major heart attack, sweaty palms, shortness of breath, etc. Any loud noise (cars honking, for example) or even someone suddenly talking to me would startle me and sometimes even make me jump. I was constantly on edge and people constantly asked me if I was okay. **It was a complete living hell** \\- which I endured for MANY years, NON-stop.\n\n**The funny thing about mental illness is that after a while of suffering with it, it somehow becomes a part of your identity and you learn to grow comfortable with it. For me, it was very hard to let go of the idea of feeling constantly anxious, and it was hard for me to embrace the idea of having a life without anxiety, PTSD or depression.**\n\nI tried so many things throughout the years to get better; yoga, meditation, exercise (running/lifting weights/pilates), natural herbs and supplements, phenibut, l-theanine,  marihuana, CBD oil, therapy, CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), aromatherapy, acupressure, breathing exercises, self-hypnosis, MANY, many different types of medication (anti-depressants/benzos/anticonvulsant), etc, etc, ETC ... **But nothing seemed to work**, and in fact, some made *it m*uch worse.\n\nI remember one day many years ago, I stumbled upon a[ youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nylajeG6uFY&list=PLD8-7zY_7MknXoph5hHREp5efU9RfcnWr) talking about **EMDR** (e*ye movement desensitization and reprocessing*), made a note on it and then forgot about it (I wish I had taken it more seriously! It would have saved me so many more years of hardship and added trauma). Eventually, I stumbled upon it again a few years later and remembered that I had read about many people claiming it helped them with their PTSD. Unfortunately I did not have the financial means to hire a professional, but I was so desperate that I decided to attempt it on myself... **and I believe that decision saved my life**.\n\nI began researching as much as I could regarding EMDR therapy and started experimenting on my own (which I do not necessarily recommend - more on that later). I remember the first session that I did was about my trauma regarding leaving the house to walk my dog (without medication). Something that I would have never even attempted  in the past. After my EMDR session (it was at night), I went to sleep and kind of forgot about it. The next day I woke up and when I thought about walking my dog, I felt surprisingly comfortable and decided to just go for it (not giving it too much thought). **And wow... how can I even describe what I felt.** I was able to walk my dog all by myself, with absolutely\\* zer*o medication and* zer\\*o anxiety for the first time. It was amazing and surreal. That was the beginning of many more sessions that followed suit in my self-healing journey.\n\nThat being said, I have to add that I have always had an interest in psychology (ironically I have always wanted to become a psychologist - and might still one day), and that even though I had suffered from all these mental issues in the past, I do know how to navigate my mind very well. So, after doing a lot of research on EMDR, I felt confident I could handle it on my own. I say this because **I do not recommend anyone attempting EMDR on their own** (without professional help) if they have no idea how consciousness, subconsciousness, memory, and traumas even work or how the brain works in general, and especially how EMDR work in connection to these.\n\nAfter I started healing myself ""spiritually"" and psychologically, it prompted me to start taking care of my physical body, as well. **I firmly believe that when your mind is not healthy, you neglect your body because there is a disconnect. But once you start feeling healthy on the inside, you re-connect with your body and start taking care of it.**  To continue on with my story - even though my ""spiritual mind"" was healing, I still suffered from insomnia, depression, foggy brain, constipation, and lethargy. I began researching how to heal my body and stumbled upon people talking about ""gut health"". Basically, I found out that your gut (digestive organs) is connected to your mind and it greatly affects your mood, your energy levels, and your overall health in major ways..**.**(you can\\* [*google ""gut mind connection.""*](https://www.google.ca/search?q=gut+mind+connection&oq=gut+mind&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j69i65j0l3.4112j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8))\\* I decided to not only go on a detox to help heal my gut, but try a **raw vegan diet** (I had read and seen the [success storie](https://youtu.be/lgovSvMZMw0?t=2m52s)s online). And guys, that was the last piece of the puzzle; it **completely changed my life**. I began to have more energy than I ever had before, my mind is now crystal clear, I no longer suffer from constipation, my insomnia is gone, my depression is gone, my skin is clearer and is not oily anymore, my hair is shinier and growing fast, my nails are stronger, and the benefits keep on coming with time. I am just a brand new person.\n\nLet me tell you that my story has a very happy ""ending"" (I am only beginning!) I was very fortunate to find a person (my dream guy, actually - no joke!) that saw past my traumas and encouraged and supported me in my self-healing journey. We are now married and have an absolutely gorgeous baby girl together (15 months). **Every morning, I wake up grateful, in serenity, with a smile on my face**; my baby girl smiling, giggling and kissing me, my wonderful husband ready to start the day with new adventures. My life now-a-days consists of them, my rescue dog (I rescued her from the streets while abroad and she was my light during my darkest moments), going on hikes and other outings/walks/adventures, working out, working from home, and much more. But while my self-healing/ self-improvement journey is still not done, I am the happiest I have ever been and I\'m excited about the future.\n\nTo conclude, if you suffer from any sort of mental illness, just know that it is possible to turn your life around 100&#37;. The main thing I have learned about my journey to health, is this: ***You do not know how sick you are until you are healthy.*** Going from a sick body (and mind) that was constantly low on energy, had nightmares, insomnia, foggy mind (poor memory, slow processing, etc), really bad eating habits, constipation, major panic attacks, anxiety, depression, paranoia, major anger issues, etc... to one that is full of energy, healthy, a mind that is clear, happy and at peace... The difference guys... is a whole other world. I know the leap may seem steep, if not impossible when you are feeling like complete garbage. But let me tell you; it\'s not impossib\\*\\*le. Your mind is the most powerful tool you \\*\\*have; and you CAN have the life you dream of. Just keep searching until you find what works for you, and never, ever give up. Hopefully the things that have helped me can help you, as well.\n\nIf you managed to read up until now, thank you. I wish you the very best in your healing journey and if you have any questions at all (I am an open book), please feel free to ask. Or if you would just like someone to talk to, feel free to message me. Also, I have thought about making some online materials to help others (EMDR videos or a website), let me know if this is something that could help you (all resources would be free- I just want to help others heal themselves).\n\n**TL; DR: After a troubled childhood and abusive relationship, I developed major, debilitating PTSD, anxiety and depression that I was able to self-treat through EMDR therapy and going on a Raw Vegan diet. My life has drastically improved for the better and I want to inspire others with my story.**\n\nP.S I just created this reddit account and the first suggested name on the list was ""InevitableDiamond,"" I just thought it was very fitting for how I feel and what my story is about. :)\n\nP.P.S I apologize for any grammar/spelling issues, I have already spent about 4 hours trying to write this post and won\'t have time to edit until later!'"

I was up starting at 2am and did not sleep. The chills and muscle tremors kept me up. My legs were uncontrollably shaking.

At this time we weren\'t allowed in the doctor\'s office and were tested in a parking garage, so after those 2 were ruled out, they said it was likely an **upper respiratory infection** (which I\'ve had a lot growing up, so made sense to me). We were given meds and sent on our way. My partner got better no problem. Me, not exactly. Everything went away except one major symptom: **thick mucus stuck in my throat that won\'t come out**.\n\nThat may not seem like a bad issue, but it\'s been hell honestly. Just imagine having *thick, wet globs* of mucus in your throat that you can\'t cough up FOR YEARS!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThis one issue snowballed into all of these **symptoms:**\n\n\\- **thick mucus stuck in my throat** (can rarely cough it up because it\'s too thick, when I can it\'s green/sometimes has dry blood in it)\n\n\\- **waking up in the middle of the night gasping for air,** feels like I\'m suffocating because I can\'t breathe bc my throat is closing, other times it\'s the mucus completely blocking my airway\n\n\\- **gasping for air** ***during the day*** is becoming more frequent\n\n\\- **hoarse/lose my voice daily**\n\n\\- **burns to talk** when I push my voice too hard (I talk for a living so unavoidable)\n\n\\- **shortness of breath** even doing regular everyday tasks\n\n\\- **constant throat clearing/cough**\n\n\\- **trouble swallowing** (esophagus feels swollen/much smaller on the inside so have to take relatively small bites)\n\n\\- **bloating after eating**\n\n\\- **right lymph node consistently swollen/uncomfortable**\n\n\\- **neck popping** on right side, sometimes painful\n\n\\- randomly **losing balance/near fainting** spells and **dizziness**\n\n\\- **headaches/migraines (new for me)**\n\n\\- **muscle weakness**\n\n\\- **back pain in the morning**\n\n\\- extreme **sensivity to light/watery eyes** (\\*lifelong issue, but worse now\\* especially indoors with lots of windows)\n\n\\- **increased heart rate even when doing nothing** (new within the last 2-3 months)\n\n\\- **extreme fatigue** ((\\*lifelong issue, but worse now\\*))\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Previous/Existing diagnoses:** Raynaud\'s syndrome, ADHD, anxiety w/panic\n\n**Current meds/vitamins/treatment:** birth control pill daily, adderall 25mg once/day, Levalbuterol via nebulizer twice daily, Albuterol inhaler as needed.

Still have my tonsils. Once around 8 or 9, I woke up and couldn\'t move my body from the waist down and was hospitalized. They couldn\'t find anything wrong. Once around 12 I was leaking whiteish liquid from my breasts and they thought it may be cancer. It was not. Around 13/14 I started feeling very light headed in the shower and my vision would go black and I couldn\'t hear anything. Pediatrician said I was anemic and deficient in vitamin D. Prescribed salt pills and vitamin D. Struggled a lot in school in comparison to others despite heavy studying and attending tutoring often, from elementary to high school. Periods very painful, heavy, and lasted around10-12+ days. Started taking birth control pills at 19 and have been skipping periods since then. I have about 4-5 periods a year. Never been pregnant. No STDs. Only major surgeries: wisdom teeth removal twice, sesamoidectomy (foot) surgery 2021. Took accutane twice as a teenager. Have had bad skin since about 6 years old, acne, premature aging by 18. Had braces twice, teeth/jaw/bite still not right. TMJ problems, will need jaw surgery in the future. Have always gotten a burning sensation in my throat when running/vigorous exercises, and have to stop early not because I can\'t push my body any further, but because my throat\'s on fire. Shin splits always happen when doing cardio. When I was about 20 I gained about 40lbs within 2 months (side effect from medication) and was told I was prediabetic. I\'ve since lost the weight, no longer prediabetic. I\'ve had 3 concussions and 1 major seizure (caused by medication). September 2021 had excess white blood cells in urine at gyno appointment. Always been tired no matter how much sleep I get. Body does not respond to caffeine. Can be difficult to do normal or even fun things when I\'m often exhausted, physically and mentally. Fatigue/brain fog/memory problems for as long as I can remember. Very pale, inability to tan, very sensitive to the sun, skin burns very easily (can happen in less than 10 mins without sunscreen. I now wear sunscreen everyday).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**What doctors have said:**\n\nInsurance at the time required referrals to see specialists. My **first PCP** *refused* to refer me to an ENT *for several months* (I\'m talking I got sick in September 2020, verbally requested around October then several times via email and calls and during checkups, and didn\'t see the ENT until MAY 2021!! and this doctor also missed a whole broken bone in my foot so...love that for me) because *she was offended* that I didn\'t ""trust her"" to solve my issues on her own (even though it was all telehealth and she never actually physically examined me???) But I eventually got them to get me a referral.\n\n**ENT** *confirmed there is a lot of mucus indeed stuck in my throat*. She put a camera up my nose and down my throat (I was not prepared for that btw, not fun). However she said that since it was too far down and ""around a corner"" per say, she couldn\'t use her tools to get it out for me and instead prescribed some meds that did nothing. She said I have acid reflux and gave me instructions on how to reduce it. I did everything suggested and reflux is rare now, but the problem still remains. After 2ish months she confirmed again there\'s still mucus back there. But the good news is she said I don\'t have any vocal cord damage which is amazing. But she also mentioned she\'s never had a patient with the same issues I have and doesn\'t know how to help at this point, I just love hearing that from my doctors. She suggested I see a GI specialist. Had to pause all visits for about 6 months bc I lost my insurance after quitting my extremely toxic/abusive workplace.\n\nThe gaslighting starts here with the **GI specialist** who *ran zero tests*, said I was too young to be having these issues (okay so explain why I\'m having them, and shouldn\'t it be alarming that I\'m having these issues ""so young""?). She suggested it\'s likely ""just anxiety."" She said I should have stuck with working with an ENT for my problems, didn\'t understand why I was referred to her, but gave me a prescription to try anyway. Surprise, it didn\'t help.\n\nThe **Allergy specialist** I saw was a sweet old lady and I really believe she tried everything she knew. Worked with her for about 6 months. Said I was positive for a sinus infection and said that it\'s likely what I\'ve had the entire time. Did a pulmonary function test and said my breathing was abnormal and my lung capacity is much worse than it should be at my age and given lifestyle. She treated me for the sinus infection and later gave me an inhaler to take twice a day, along with an emergency inhaler to use before exercise. At a follow up she said my lung capacity was at 70. I still don\'t know exactly what this means, but it didn\'t sound good. I suggested wanting to get a chest x-ray done, and to see a pulmonologist at this point and she agreed. Got chest x-ray done, she called me and said ""everything looks fine"" and that was it on that. I got a food allergy test done bc at this point I\'m thinking something I\'m eating everyday could be the cause, but no. (I will say I\'d like to redo the test with another ENT for a second opinion, bc the way this test was carried out was unusual imo) After this, she told me my body is so sensitive and she\'s tried everything and doesn\'t know how else to help me. I just about lost it right there, it was just so devastating to hear. One of her final suggestions was that it could be ""a minor cough"" like she has, and/or it could be all in my head from \\*drumroll\\* *anxiety*. Even after having proof from the ENT that there is definitely mucus there and I\'m not imagining it. Just wonderful.\n\nSaw a **pulmonologist** and they *completely dismissed me* and *didn\'t test me for anything*. Said something along the lines of, ""honey this is just anxiety what you\'re describing, us women have it, it\'s very common!"" and that anxiety can create a ""lump in the throat"" sensation, but nothing is there. DESPITE AN ENT STICKING A CAMERA DOWN MY THROAT AND CONFIRMING SOMETHING IS IN THERE! *She suggested trying regular, over the counter meds that I\'ve already tried. ((wow, doctor you cured me!!))* This interaction was infuriating!\n\nWent to a **naturopath** to see if alternative medicine would work for me. They drew my blood, forgot to test me for immunodeficiencies/autoimmune disorders (love that), but did state that my B12 was low and my vitamin D is one of the lowest she\'s ever seen (no shock to me, I\'ve always been told this since I was a kid, I just hadn\'t taken vitamins in a while). Suggested I buy her expensive vitamin supplements, but I just got some from amazon bc I just couldn\'t afford vitamins for over $70/month each. She also asked me about my past and family life and said that *sometimes when you hold on to trauma too long, it can cause problems with your gut health* which is where our immune system is etc and can become weakened, and manifest into physical illnesses that won\'t go away until the trauma is correctly processed and immune system is healed. On one hand it sounds far out, but on the other hand it did kind of make sense. But at the same time, for me, I know my issues started as an actual illness. She said I need to start therapy, (and also purchase a very expensive controversial water therapy program she was selling) but at that time I couldn\'t afford that.\n\nFound a **new** **pulmonologist** on a whim while just messing around on google maps in my area and decided to give it a try. Went to my first appointment with him about 2 weeks ago, told him everything, showed him my x-rays. This is the first doctor I\'ve seen so far that seems like he actually cares. He told me *he believes me*, and knows it isn\'t "" just anxiety"" and that he will try his very best to help me. I felt so validated and so heard and understood that day. He said the x-rays do not indeed look normal and ordered a chest CT scan. He suggested that I stop using my inhaler bc it was likely *making my problems worse* by drying out my throat, which causes my body to super overproduce mucus. Also prescribed a **nebulizer** to use twice a day, and told me to take regular **Mucinex without the D** so I can try to cough some of the mucus up. I\'ll be going in for a follow up next week for my results.\n\nWent to my **new PCP** also about 2 weeks ago. He was also a shining star in my eyes, bc he also seems very caring and really wanted to help me. He said he sees weird and unique situations all the time so he seemed confident in helping me. They drew some blood that day, and also wanted me to get a 2nd round of bloodwork done somewhere else for more in depth tests/results. I have an appointment next week for the 2nd round of bloodwork, and will have a follow up soon after that. In the meantime, they called with the first half of my results, saying my **B12 was high** but that\'s okay, that my **vitamin D levels are insanely high** and could result in vitamin D toxicity so cut back on the dosage, and that my **blood** **platelet count was a lot higher than usual**, but they said we\'ll discuss that further and also retest it at my next appointment. For context, they said the normal range is between 130-140, but mine was 421. From what I understand, the rest of the bloodwork will be tested for autoimmune disorders, thyroid issues, cancer and a few other things.\n\n**BONUS:** I\'m just getting over another upper respiratory infection that lasted about 3 weeks. During the 2nd week I had 3 instances within an hour while I was awake at home on my computer, where my throat was closing on me and I was gasping for air. Felt like I was gonna die. Decided to go to the ER (my partner drove me). The doctor there was one of the worst I\'ve ever encountered and he actually made me cry when we left. First thing he asked is, ""so, what exactly are you expecting me to do?"" ...I was shook to say the least. Didn\'t see that coming at all. I said, ""I\'m expecting you to help me."" He proceeds to tell me that ""this is an ER. You are not having an emergency. If you came to me WHILE you couldn\'t breathe, I could\'ve helped. But you\'re perfectly fine right now. You\'re not showing signs of panic or distress and your vitals are fine. So what do you expect me to do?"" VERY close to me, staring me down, speaking in a very condescending tone. I was just so blown away by his behavior and lack of empathy. I said, ""Okay, so how would you help me if my throat was closing or I had mucus blocking my airway right now, what would you do?"" He said, ""Well, there are so many different things we could do depending on the situation, I could shove a breathing tube down your throat, or even better, I could shove one of those tubes down your throat that we use on BABIES, kinda like when they have too many boogers in their noses and suck all of that stuff out of there."" The way he said that was definitely to make me feel bad and to compare my problem to a baby who can\'t blow their nose. Just insane. Something has to be done about the way patients are treated when seeking help. I understand some people go to the ER for nothing. But not everyone. I told him I felt like I was dying. He said he couldn\'t do anything and doesn\'t know what to tell me. All the medications I\'ve tried is something he would\'ve suggested, which, fair on that since I have tried a lot. But then someone came in with some paperwork for me to sign saying something about I agree that I was treated today, argued with her for a minute saying I wasn\'t treated. She gave me paperwork to take home and it said to take Allegra -\\_- I refused to sign the paperwork and left. I just thought that was such a wild situation I wanted to include it.\n\nSo, that\'s where I\'m at right now. I appreciate any comments, and thank you so much if you took the time to read this whole thing <3\n\n**TLDR:** I\'ve had mucus stuck in my throat for over 2 years that\'s too thick to cough up and after seeing several doctors and specialists no one can figure out what exactly is wrong, why this is happening or how to treat it. This is causing a laundry list of other problems including breathing problems, losing my voice daily, throat closing, and mucus blocking my airways which makes me feel like I\'m suffocating. I\'ve tried tons of medications. It is affecting my quality of life significantly. Looking for answers or comfort in knowing I\'m not the only one going through this.\n\n*\\*cross posted bc I\'m desperate for answers\\**'"

cymbalta,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/146ms2q/my_provider_is_so_wrong_about_how_to_taper_off/,"b""My provider is so wrong about how to taper off Cymbalta, and I don't know what to do. Also - how old can your bottle of Cymbalta be, before you shouldn't take it anymore?""",,"b'Hi everyone. Unlike many here, I\'ve been able to taper off Cymbalta (using a cross-taper though) without having to do bead-counting. However, even with the way that my PA (physician\'s assistant) has laid out my tapering plan, this is just a no-no. I\'m on 60 mg Cymbalta right now and eventually will reinstate Prozac. The thing is, he wants me to reinstate 10 mg Prozac while still ON the 60 mg Cymbalta. YIKES. NO NO NO. I\'ve taken a small dose of Lexapro and a small dose of Cymbalta at the same time (as part of the last tapering plan I had from Cymbalta) and I can assure you, I could feel a tinge of Serotonin Syndrome coming on. I don\'t want to feel that again.\n\nFor me, I\'d feel better going down to 40 mg first ***without*** taking 10 mg Prozac with that 40 mg Cymbalta at the same time. I may have to tell a white lie to my provider saying that I\'d ""rather reinstate Prozac while on 40 mg Cymbalta instead of 60 mg Cymbalta,"" but secretly just take the 40 mg Cymbalta and not tell him that I haven\'t combined it with the Prozac. At least with this method, it won\'t rattle me the way the Cymbalta/Prozac combo would. I know my body and I know that tapering Cymbalta the way I prefer, has not caused the same kind of reactions that it has on this forum.\n\nWhat the heck do I do? I cannot do what this guy wants. It\'s impossible. The thing is, I have a bottle of a lot of 20 mg Cymbaltas, but they are 2 years old. (Sigh)'"

Fast forward to recently it's still there, I visit the doctor for a unrelated issue and mention the leg and back pains. The doctor said it sounded like sciatica and prescribed some pain medication. In the end I didnt grab them from the pharmacy due to the pain being minimal. It was just an inconvenience. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, woke up as per normal, had a shower then I was drying myself I raised my left leg onto our bedroom couch and in that split second an immense indescribable amount of pain got sent through my entire body. It felt like someone had stabbed me or shot me in my lower back. Suddenly the feeling in my left leg and lower back was multiplied by 1000x.\n\nI called the emergency services, and they told me to call my gp, called him and he thought it may be was a muscle spasm. Prescribed some codeine and referred me to the physio service which takes 4 days to do so. \n\nSince yesterday I have barely been able to walk without excruciating pain, extreme difficulty going for a wee (takes around 2-5 minutes for it to start) and have been in so much discomfort its left me bed bound. This morning I went for a number 2 and it took me 30 minutes of trying, the more I pushed the more painful it was. I dont think I was able to 'fully' go. I had wind trapped in my stomach all night from being unable to pass it unless I really push. I'm concerned soon I may have bad constipation. \n\nI've called the doctor again today because I'm really worried. From my research I feel like I experienced my disc herniated or the disc slipped in this single instance. The pain runs severely from my lower back all the through my left leg to my foot. \n\nMy question to you guys, what does it sound like to you? I'm not one to self diagnose but I feel like if I know I can describe the pain better to a specialist.\n\nIs a muscle cramp the same as a herniated disc (assuming not). Why was I feeling pain in the area for the last 2 months now and what happened yesterday that multiplied that to a 10 on the pain level? \n\nShould I be patient and wait to feel better or push to be seen by a specialist? \n\nMany thanks, and I feel you for what you are/have gone through."""

Also had some prediabetic signs in my bloodwork last time) and it feels more or less the same, can't sleep, hands shaking, very vivid hypnagogic hallucinations, like I close my eyes and I'm instantly on an endless visual trip with very clear details and the ability to look around. \n\nSo how is it for you?"""

I hope so'",,"b'&#x200B;\n\nCrap, I cant believe I spelt it wrong , ADHD . sorry about that . This is a long post and I know your guys have precious little time and have to deal with your own demons so I appreciate your time\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood day all you lovely people . I just wanted to share my findings and maybe give some insight on what it feels like if somebody should think about getting a diagnoses or contemplating using it.\n\nThis is just a disclaimer and I am not a doctor by any way, shape or form and totally anecdotal so please take everything with a grain of salt.\n\nI have been given both Concerta and Ritalin to test with and see what works best.  here is just as a brief history .  I have been diagnosed with depression in the past but stopped using my Wellbutrin medication for various reasons , biggest being I could not cope with the ""zombie"" state and I felt my Psychiatrist miss diagnosed me. I had depression but I think it was because of my AHAD and not my ""inherent"" depression. You kind of feel like a loser when you are in school and can\'t concentrate for shit and everybody makes you feel like a dumb ass. Eventually you lose interest because you feel , what is the point  you just going to fail , right ? I spoke quicker than I was thinking and that made me look even dumber and the same thing happened when I when I had to write something down. I see the words but I don\'t understand them and cant remember anything\n\nLuckily, I was not completely stupid even only going to school for 2 days a week , the rest of the week I  slipped out and stayed at a friends house even when I was at school I would disruptive and tried to get chased out of class.  My life was a living hell but I was able to graduate . Went to study IT after school and graduated by the skin of my ass\n\nForward to now ,I have to study something else because my field is a sink hole and I need to upskill, change my field or do something completely different .  I know exactly what I need to do but concentrating for more than 2 minutes is torture . That is what prompted me to get another diagnoses because I never though I had this ADD issue. Just though it was depression. So officially I started last week and these are my findings.\n\nI don\'t even know how to put this into words but I will try... I can concentrate for the first time in my life . Not only is my mind focused I actually care about things that I found boring or could not read  because my attention would fail .  For the first time in my life I feel optimism .   this is a strange feeling because I am not used to it.  For the first time I feel hope.\n\nMaybe it will be short lived , this is only the first week but I can feel it and no its not the placebo affect . I know what it feels like to be on anti depressants and what it did to my mind. This is different .\n\nI think one of life\'s biggest issues are that we feel that we are not living up to our potential , nothing worse than wasting ones time and talents and yes we all have a talent . Something you would think is stupid for you but completely out of reach for somebody else. I like talking  , a lot  , maybe its my ADHD but still . I know you guys think its stupid but some people cant do it at all .  I will try to be the best me ,  I just want to feel I gave it my all . win or lose .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIF anybody should be interested ,  I will be leaving a ""diary"" of sorts on this forum if anybody wants to see the affects .  Like I said this is anecdotal and everybody is different but I always say that more information is better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wish for all you lovely people are just being content.  I hope you succeed in that journey and sorry for this long ass post .  Whoever reads this you have my thanks and I sincerely appreciate it.'"

It\'s either they don\'t believe you, or think you\'re a junky trying to get high on pain meds or that you\'re lying about the amount of narcotics your doctor administers for break\n\nYears ago, I had an older physician Dr. B, who was part of a cancer practice group. He was amazing, the best part was he actually listened to me. It honestly felt like a partnership. I saw him for close to 10 years, and because it was a cancer treatment facility, when I got flare ups, I went in and was prescribed/administered IV pain meds and fluids.\nAs Dr. B was older, he finally decided to retire in order to spend more time with his family.\nWhen he did retire he referred me to a new doctor who joined the practice. Dr. S.\n\nRight off the bat, on our first meeting she was immediately combative, she went on a diatribe about my pain meds and how she\'s strict about them. She immediately made me sign a pain management contract and stated if I ever broke the contract I was out.\n\nThe first time I had my crisis, and came to the infusion center, she cut my prescription from 6mg to 4. Not a big deal, but now most times I have to go in 2-3 days to get my pain under control rather than the 1 day before.\n\nThen we had a discussion about a drug Hydra. I mentioned that Dr. B had me on it, it caused me to get sick more frequently and eventually caused me to almost die in the ICU. I was going into sepsis from toxicity from that particular medication.\n\nShe didn\'t care, wanted me on it. I tried to argue my case but she never listened. So, I decided I just won\'t pick up the prescription from the pharmacy.\nEventually she found out I wasn\'t taken the meds (blood tests), I reluctantly agreed to start taking them.\n\nWell my previous experience is repeating itself, I\'m having more frequent crisis, almost every other week.\nThe last time I went into the infusion center for pain management, the drugs were cut again, this time from 4mg to 2.\nI talked 4mg Dilaudid orally, which as I understand it, the bioavailability comes down to 2. So wondering why she\'did prescribe 2mg when I\'ve done 2mg every 3 hours at home didn\'t help.\nAnyway, talked to the administering Nurse and was told ""well you\'ll get a second dose later so it\'s the same thing"". This came from Dr. S.\n\nWith my crisis getting more frequent and having this, I pretty much stopped going to the infusion center. It\'s all the inconvenience of getting there, getting a ride to come back, without actually relieving my pain, seems like I\'m just as well taking the same dose at home.\n\nThis brings us to today, she had me stop the hydrea to try a new medication, an infusion of crizanlizumab.\n\nThis triggered a bad flare up, my pain was at a 9 in my joints and back, my face was flush. My bp which is normally 110/60 jumped to 155/70.\nThe nurses gave me benedryl, and steroids to mitigate the reaction.\n\nThe doctor refused to prescribe pain meds. The nurses asked her a number of times, finally she said I could have Toradal.\nAnyway, I wasn\'t looking/feeling better and both nurses decide to contact the doctor again requesting pain meds.\n\nWhen the nurse came back, she whispered to the other nurse that she asked the doctor whose response was ""I don\'t believe him"".\nIt\'s one thing to go through crap like that from ER doctors who don\'t know my history, but from the doctor that\'s been treating me for over 5 years?\n\nI know this is an unusual situation/question for this sub, but at this point I\'m at a loss for what to do.\nSo, doctors in the sub, what do you recommend?'"

It started when I woke up with a cluster of 3 small red bumps on my hand that my immediate assumption were bug bites.

The bumps take about 3 to 4 weeks to totally flatten, but always seem to leave some type of mark/scar.\n\nAbout a month ago a doctor described it as an inflammation under my skin, and folliculitis. He gave me an anti bacterial soap (triclosan 1%) and cream (prednisolone/gentamicin sulphate). This appeared to improve the condition for a few weeks, with a few recurring bumps. Then, it came back again with new bumps every few days and the existing bumps never really going away. I also now get a few on my face (1 under my eye, 2 on my forehead that look like little pimples, 1 on side of my nose), but they are much smaller and disappear within 2 weeks.\n\nI was also given 7 day course of amoxicillin and continuing the soap and cream. I'm on day 6 of the antiobiotc and no improvement, its still continuosly getting worse.\n\nThey ran rheumatologicsl blood tests and I am okay. I do have eczema on my lower legs and my mom and sister both suffer from a variety of skin issues, psoriasis and my mom has rheumatoid arthritis.

Which was much appreciated by the way.\n\nSo today I met with my doctor to go over my medication plans yet again after doing some more research, and we both agreed that its most likely the high dose of Gabapentin thats been causing the Ambien to not affect me properly. \n\nThat, along with the fact Ive found I  am needing significantly more Klonopin than what was originally prescribed ever since  the assault occurred- as my panic attacks and new-founded agoraphobia has worsened more than you could fathom.\n\nMy doctor and I did come up with a plan to ween me off my current dose of gabapentin (currently 1800 mg per day; 600mg 3x daily.)\n\nIm happy to say that within even just the first week or two I have been able to get down to about 1 pill 3x a day as opposed to 2. As of today I am now beginning to forgo the evening dose of the gabapentin all together and avoiding eating after lunchtime, in order to allow the Ambien to affect me as affectively as possible under my current circumstances.\n\nGoing down on the Gab has been a huge thing for me, as in the past when Id been trying to lower my dosage- let alone try to get off of of it all together, had been the single worst withdrawals Ive ever experienced in my life. And I mean worse than coming off an opioid and benzo withdrawal simultaneously after having been on both of them for multiple years.\n\nBut this time around I havent found that Ive had very many problems with my reduction of my gabapentin dosage (as of yet, I pray.) which has been a lifesaver compared to everything else Im going through. Because if it had been anything like what it was like before when I tried to come off it, theres no way I could possibly do it.\n \nAlso yes I am aware that the amount of benzos I take a day (depending on the day- approx anywhere from 4-7mg of Klonopin per day) likely also strongly affects my GABA receptors ability to not properly absorb the Ambien at this time. However, I am just currently not in a safe mental/emotional state to lower my Benzo usage while still reeling from a horrifically brutal assault. \n\nIm just reiterating, Im what you would call  a seasoned veteran when it comes to benzodiazepines. Ive been on 4mg per day for many years so I have an extremely high tolerance. Though it is only been since the assault that it was increased to 5-7 mg per day as a PRN by my doctor.\n \nAlso- I have no doubt that the amount of benzos I take a day (depending on the day- approx anywhere from 4-7mg of Klonopin per day) likely also strongly affects my GABA receptors ability to not properly absorb the Ambien at this time. However, I am just currently not in a safe mental/emotional state to lower my usage if Benzos while still reeling from a horrifically brutal assault. (Just to reiterate, Im what you might call  a seasoned veteran when it comes to benzodiazepines. Ive been on 4mg per day for many years so I have an extremely high tolerance. Though it is only been since the assault that it was increased to 5-7 mg per day.)\n\nAt this appointment, due to the physical trauma of the assault my pain meds also had to be up as well. Which I am aware that opioids also affects your GABA receptors. Im on 15mg of Vicodin (5mg 3x let day, as well as 20mg of Oxycodone per day 5mg 4x per day. (Another sidenote, these are medications that I have been on for more years than any of the other ones. And then my taper it has come down significantly. As opposed to what Im on now, I used to be on 10 mg of Dilaudid per day which if you know much about opioids, is beyond a significant difference.)\n\nAll of this being said, my doctor and I, decided to put me on 10 mg of Ambien per evening. Since I still have not been feeling much of an affect yet, today I waited for 24 hours before eating & took my Klonopin, one pain med, and my Ambien at the same time. Since I have yet to feel anything from Ambien whatsoever I took two of my Ambien, a total of 20mg. \n \nTo be safe, I only took one of my Klonopin (2mg), and two of my Oxys (a total of 10mg) instead of the normal dose of each of those. And I forwent to Vicodin all together. \n\nAs a sidenote I would like to iterate that this is not what I intended to become a daily regimen, I do just wants want to experience the high at all. And after that I will continue to use just enough of each med and the right combination for it to be effective.\n\n\nI will keep you all posted on how tonight goes. Im hoping it goes well and that I get to hopefully trip, feel extremely relaxed, and get some very much needed physical pain relief. \n\nThank you all again for your prior advice on my previous post. \n\nAlso- if any of you happen to have any experience whatsoever with taking all these same/similar meds or similar med classes at the same time, I would also greatly appreciate your feedback as well. \n\nThank you guys.'"

I\'m either too hot or too cold most of the time, and I have chillblains on my fingers and toes pretty much permanently. I try to take a brisk 30 min walk once per day, to try to keep circulation flowing.\n\nThe other day, my hands and feet started feeling really hot and tight. Normal for me when I come out of the cold into the warmth too fast, but this lasted all day, which I thought was odd. The next day, I woke up with a full body, bright red rash. It started mainly on my ""trunk"" backside, back of the legs, lower legs and looked a lot like a sunburn.\n\nWeirdly, I was also absolutely freezing. Couldn\'t get warm. When I tried to do my usual 30 min walk to warm up (on the treadmill this time, in case I felt discomfort and needed to hop off) I ended up with a bright red rash on the inner thighs, and weirdly, my FEET turned bright red. The inner edges are red and slightly puffy and pretty sore to walk on.\n\nThis morning, I woke up with the rash on my backside and inner thighs mostly gone, but it\'s spread to my hands now. My knuckles and the edges of my palms are red, and my hands are tight and sore. It\'s annoying, because it\'s a bit painful to pick things up or hold things.\n\nFor background: I take 18mg of concerta for ADHD. 10mg of Lexapro for anxiety, and single hormon BCP (I get migraines with aura).

For the most part I took 2 pills each night, usually with dinner, though I have to say I didn\'t really notice a difference whether or not I took it with a meal.\n\nAnother thing I\'ll mention in case it applies to you: I have steatocystoma multiplex. I inherited from my dad, and it\'s essentially hundreds of small bumps under my skinmostly chest and back. Feel free to skip this paragraph if you don\'t have these. They\'re actually sacs of sebum, but the only treatment right now is excision. I first thought I had familial inherited lipomatosis and as a result had multiple lipomas, but my derm diagnosed them as steatocystomas. I experienced an ""initial breakout"" (IB) but it was very gradual and lasted most of the course. For most people this acne/cystic IB is normal on Accutane, but since I have steatocystoma multiplex, it also seemed to trigger an steatocystoma IB! These new steatocystomas were much larger than usual, and one in particular was so large that I had to get my derm to inject steroids into it to reduce swelling a couple months ago. Right now it\'s actually slowly ejecting itself, which has never happened to any of my steatocystomas, so that\'s weird and kinda freaky lol. Time will tell whether this had any long term effect on my steatocystoma multiplex.\n\nMy experience:\n\n* **Dry lips, skin, eyes, hair**\n* **Constant exhaustion and fatigue**, so much that I\'d almost fall asleep between sets at the gym. I could sleep 10-12 hours a day and still feel tired. This combined with the dry eyes were honestly the worst side effects for me. Lips were actually fine for me because of Lanolinsee below for tips. But the EXHAUSTION! Get ready to be TIRED AF *all the time*.\n* Slightly thinner, sparser, and curlier hair. I used to get my hair thinned once or twice a year, but I don\'t think I\'ll ever need to do that again now that my hair is thinner & sparser (not sparse, just sparser).\n* Slight joint pain, mostly in the knees\n* Giant black boogers. Presumably dried blood. Gross. So much and so big that I had trouble breathing through my nose sometimes. Believe it or not I actually never picked my nose before these came into my life because I just really ever get boogers lol, and the small amount I did get I just got rid of them by blowing my nose.\n* One night I woke up a split second before a spontaneous nosebleed would ruin my sheets, but that was the one and only nosebleed I got from Accutane. See tips below for prevention.\n* On average I had to drink more water, otherwise my urine would be super dark yellow. Drinking more water didn\'t seem to have any other noticeable effects though. It\'s probably good for you in general, but it personally didn\'t alleviate exhaustion or dry lips/eyes/skin.\n* My skin, eyes, lips, and hair returned to normal after about 2-3 weeks at the end of my course. All are slightly drier than before my course, which means that my T-zone is still kind of oily, since I began with an *extremely* oily T-zone.\n* My night vision is slightly worse, and lights have a faint aura, especially at night. It\'s already better now and we\'ll see if this goes away with time but it\'s not a huge side effect for me. It could be much worse.\n* I\'m not sure if this is related but on average I had an easier time cleanly passing stool, otherwise known as the ghost poop, where you wipe and there\'s nothing there! Again, not sure if Accutane did this or if it was just a coincidence.\n* Personally I could go several days without showering because I never got dirty, sweaty, oily, or smelly. It was kind of weird lol. I used to shower every single day so that was a big change. After a while it got annoying to moisturize head to toe after every shower, so I\'d shower every other day or so.\n\nFinally, some tips:\n\n* **REMEMBER**: Everyone responds to Accutane differently.\n* **PACKAGING**: Avoid Myorisan because the packaging is impossible to deal with smh. Everyone complains about Accutane packaging but honestly just get Claravis and once you remove the foil containing the pills from all the packaging and it\'s actually super duper easy to get your pills \\\\_()_/ That\'s right, let me repeat: You can remove the pill foil from all the packaging. Tell your dermatologist to be explicit about the brand when sending the prescription to the pharmacy, and they\'ll usually do their best to fulfill the request.\n* **HAIRCARE**: **Stop using shampoo.** You don\'t need it. Accutane targets your sebaceous glands, and without sufficient oil they usually produce, your hair can fall out very easily. I experienced this last night (a month after I completed my course): I washed my hair with just a little bit of shampoo and every time I gently ran my hand through my hair, a couple of strands would fall out, and it just would not stopif this happens to you, stop running your hands through your hair, put a leave-in conditioner in, get out of the shower, and stop using shampoo henceforth. I cleanse my hair with conditioner every few days and put in a leave-in conditioner most days. Also, in case you\'re interested in hair color, I was able to bleach & dye my hair from black to blond (ashy blond balayage, about a 7 or 8) in one sitting but that might be because I have thick and strong hair, and I was super oily everywhere, including my scalp/hair, before starting Accutane. Be gentle with your hair and it will thank you. Washing and drying (towel or otherwise), be gentle!\n* **HOLY GRAIL ITEM #1**: **LANOLIN** nipple cream. This is the single most important item throughout my Accutane journey. If I had to pick ONE item that made the course bearable it would be **LANOLIN** nipple cream. Trust me, it\'s cheap and *one small tube* will last you almost your entire course. No matter *how* dry your lips, this will keep them super moist super long. I put it on overnight and it makes a world of difference. If I fall asleep and forget to put it on, I\'ll wake up with super chapped lips, to the point of cracking if I yawn. Even then, a minute or so after I apply it to super chapped lips, my lips magically healed. What makes Lanolin much better than any other product is that it integrates with your skin and seeps into it. Lip balm, vaseline, and Aquaphor all just sit on top of your lips. They work by creating a seal that keeps the moisture in, but it does nothing to increase the moisture. Aquaphor or lip balm will dry up and leave a nasty film on top of my lips that I constantly needed to wipe off. Lanolin never does that. It literally seeps into your lips and moisturizes from inside AND keeps the moisture in. It\'s also tasteless and odorless, and if you want that lip gloss look you get that for free. That\'s probably the only downside I can think of, that you might not want glossy lips. You should only use Dr. Dan\'s (hydrocortisone) sparingly, and definitely not in the long term, but honestly you shouldn\'t put steroid cream on your lips if you don\'t have to. I have both Dr. Dan\'s and lanolin, and lanolin actually healed about the same, if not better. You can even stick a little bit up your nose to prevent nosebleeds. It\'s safe for mom and baby since it\'s meant for sore nipples from breastfeeding, meaning you can literally eat it and be fine, which is comforting for something you\'re constantly putting on your lips. You only need a tiny, tiny, tiny bit each application, and that will last you probably until the next time you eat or drink something. There are some lip balms coming out that use lanolin because people are finally realizing what they\'re missing out on. I have a bunch of Aquaphor and lip balm lying around now because lanolin was just so much superior. Literally if I could give every Accutane user just ONE tip I would say **LANOLIN. LANOLIN. LANOLIN.**.\n* **HOLY GRAIL ITEM #2**: CeraVe moisturizing cream with pump. This is some heavy duty moisture and it\'s safe for sensitive skin! I used it head to toe, including face and basically every part of my entire body, even eyelids. It lasts all night, and the pump makes it super easy to dispensealso just feels better than having to open the tub and stick your fingers in all the time.\n* **HOLY GRAIL ITEM #3**: Systane/Refresh eye drops and/or gel drops. The drops are good for temporary eye dryness relief. The gel drops blur your vision for a little bit but the relief lasts a little longer. The gels that come in a tube (not gel drops) are thicker, harder to use, and are really only meant for bedtime.\n* **SUN**: Obviously, avoid the sun whenever possible, and wear sunscreen! One time I was at the park for the whole afternoon, and even though I liberally applied 3 layers of sunscreen, I still got sunburned. It\'s no joke. This is what my thigh looked like that day: https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/8o7uwd/my_thigh_after_a_few_hours_in_the_sun_today_i/\n* Do *not* take any tetracycline class of antibiotics (for example, doxycycline) while you\'re on Accutane. I got a few bacterial infections during my course and luckily there are several other classes of antibiotics you can use that are okay to take with Accutane.\n\nThat\'s it! Overall I\'m happy I decided to take it, at least so far. During my course my skin was insanely smoothto the point of shining like handsome Squidward. It\'s back to normal now but smoother than before the tane. We\'ll see if there are any adverse long-term side effects. Fingers crossed! Finally, I\'ll just leave you with, you guessed it, **LANOLIN SAVES LIPS** and my lips literally *never* bled because of lanolin. Godspeed.'"

Thoughts?',,"b'To be very clear from the start, I\'m not planning to kill myself, but wanted to talk about a fear that I have.\n\nI am more or less on 3 medications at once to fix 2 primary issues I have: Extreme anxiety (especially social anxiety) and what I believe to be undiagnosed ADHD.\n\nFor Anxiety:\n\n* Clonazepam 0.25mg\n\n  * I was prescribed Clonazepam for anxiety relief. I believe it works pretty effectively even on the small 0.25mg dosage Im on\n\n* Escitalopram 10mg\n\n  * I believe I was prescribed the for anxiety and depression and this should take 4-8 weeks to kick in (I\'m about 2 and a half weeks into this)\n\nFor ADHD:\n\n* Adderall XR 10mg\n\n  * I believe I was prescribed this for the adhd (they say the plan is to increase this every 2 weeks until I get the desired effect). So far I think it *might* be helping??? but its too close to placebo to call effective. I have noticed feeling less hungry though, which is great.\n\n---\n\nOk, context out of the way, what are my fears?\n\nThe recommended instructions for Clonazepam say to take 2 per day as needed (which I assume to mean that I don\'t take it on days I am not in anxiety filled situations. The psychiatrist said they expect Ill take one a day in the morning (where I said the most anxiety comes usually from a scheduled work meeting).\n\nThe last weekend I did so anyways, but this weekend did not.\n\nThis monday morning early morning like 3AM (I didn\'t really get much sleep so this is when I woke up), I felt fucking awful. Like I lay there anxious as I\'ve ever been with no particular thoughts about anything anxiety inducing in particular but just kept thinking ""I should just fucking kill myself and be done with it"" and dreaming of the blissful lack of pain/fade to white and then nothing at the end of jumping off a tall building.\n\nThe whole time I realized this was super unhealthy and uncharacteristically strong. Like for the past ... over a decade of my life I have generally been depressed and thought casually , but never with strong emotion about it, and I still maintain that my plan is to only see it as an option when my options for trying to treat it seem like they are running out (in practical terms meaning that after I\'ve tried with at least one more psychiatrist if this doesn\'t work out, gotten a psychologist I vibe with this psychiatrist etc) I would throw in the towel.\n\nAnyhow my point here is, for around 2 weeks I have been much less anxiety filled and have had a much less depressed mood than normal with hope for my future given the positive effects I had seen with both the Adderall and Clonazepam. I don\'t feel like I was actually at any danger of killing myself, but the emotion to do so so suddenly despite my the previous 2 weeks or so of a heightened mood has me worried about my medications.\n\nIs it the Escitalopram with the rare side effects of suicide ideation or is it my not taking clonazepam for one day? \n I knew clonazepam built up dependency, but is it that quickly??? \n\nI don\'t know the answers to any of those, but it was genuinely extremely scary. Like someone had pointed a depression/anxiety-anator at my head and pulled the trigger.\n\nHas anyone experienced anything like this?\n\nI think I\'m going to continue taking everything as prescribed every day, and bring this up with my psychiatrist when I meet them again next week, but I thought Id leave this here with the hopes to get some opinions, thoughts, and potentially some information for anyone who runs into my situation in the future and wonders if they are alone in this.'"

Symptoms flare up at night and have shown no improvement since onset.\n\nMedical Info: Allergic to penicillin, anemic.\n\nI have attached photos. I thought it was just very sry skin initially but now, after researching it, I think it's  **Pompholyx** (dyshidrotic eczema)  for these reasons:\n\n1. It itches badly! It's also quite painful especially when wet or just after drying (after shower, etc.). Sometimes I cannot bend my knuckles and just touching the skin is verry painful. \n2. The tiny blisters. I saw what looked like very tiny scabs from tiny cuts but then I saw actual cuts, where the skin  broke open like it was being stretched too far. \n3. When I first got it and also when in contact with water, it burns. Like the area will turn blotchy and red and feels very raw (like it would after touching pepper and touching your face after) like it's radiating heat. It stings badly.\n4.

penicillin side effect,https://www.reddit.com/r/headaches/comments/g4urno/ive_significantly_reduced_my_tension_headaches/,"b""I've significantly reduced my Tension Headaches""",,"b'A little backstory, my tension headaches would usually start when I woke up. It would be a tightness or tension feeling in my neck, right below the skull. It would slowly build throughout the day and I was always unable to relief it. I would try, and it would rise to the the top of my skull into a painful headache where I\'d need to lay down. I used to try to beat it whenever I got it. But realized it was better to just take headache medicine. I was only really taking it 1-2 times a week, I believe. I developed an allergy to Ibuprofen and switched to Aleve. The Aleve took way longer to kick in so I felt more pain. When we feel pain we want to fix it, so I spent years trying to figure it out. \n\nI believe I have solved it for the most part and I don\'t know specifically what fixed it so I will tell you what changed for me. \n\nFirst, telling myself to sit up straight was not working. My posture is awful and I think it\'s a big factor for tension headaches. \n\nHere\'s what I started doing: \n* Strength training regularly (calisthenics, kettlebell, weights)\n* Using a Standing desk way more at work\n* Yoga for posture (lots of playlists for 5, 10 minutes)(I recently fell out of this but doesn\'t seem to have an effect yet)\n* Running every other day to relieve tension\n* I have a nice heating pack (with rice) that I warm up and lay on my shoulders throughout the day. It feels so good!\n* The change that had the biggest impact IMO or maybe just topped it off was Not using a pillow AND sleeping on my back. I went through 8 different pillows and eventually switched to no pillow, but ALSO I went from a side sleeper to a back sleeper. This was Tough! I was willing to get no sleep for it though and still catch myself on my Side sometimes. \n\n**UPDATE**\nStill sleeping on my back, but I have also believe the cardio needs to be highlighted. Making sure extra tension/stress is burned off is very important. I bike 8 miles every other day or so. (~30 minutes) My nails are growing (I\'ve always chewed them off from anxiety/stress), my jaw is no longer tense from grinding, and my neck is not tense when I wake up. Seriously, add exercise to your lifestyle and add some more. Train safely and work your way up. This will become a lifestyle for you because every time you don\'t want to do some cardio you should be thinking of your worse tension headache or night of teeth grinding. \n\n**EDIT** I have a memory foam topper for my mattress so my head sinks into it a little bit. I think it\'s 3 inch. So you still may need a really thin memory foam pillow. Sleep on my back may be the most crucial.\n\nBut if you look at how you side sleep you curl up. So I was ""hunched"" 8 hours at work and 6-8 hours while sleeping. \n\nMy tension headaches only come back if I sit on the couch and game for a really long time. I\'d say I went from 1-2 a week to 1 every month or 2 maybe. \n\nHope this gives some people some hope. I was really at the mercy of these damn headaches. But now I\'m moving on to trying to improve my bruxism LOL'"

I have mild but persistent acne, 24 y/o female. I loved accutane the first time around, had little to no side effects (dry lips but they were fine as long as I used Dr Dans hydrocortisone balm) and got to about 95% clear skin by the end of my first course. I think I was on it for about 9 months. I weigh 145 lbs and was on 30mg Claravis twice a day for the whole time. \n\nMy acne started coming back just a couple months after I finished and is now back fully about a year and a half after finishing my first round. Since joining this Reddit, Ive noticed a few things that I might have been doing incorrectly. Let me know if you think this impacted my results. Id love any tips/tricks for how I should do it differently this time to ensure better results that actually last! \n\n1. Though I was prescribed 30mg twice a day, I was not great about taking it at two separate times and would often end up taking both of the 30 mg pills at the same time (usually before bed, after dinner).\n\n2. I was dieting throughout my first Accutane course and was trying to avoid super fatty foods. My derm at the time told me Accutane absorbs better and the results last longer when its taken with fatty foods. I would sometimes have a peanut butter sandwich before taking Accutane (per my former derms recommendation) but not always. Does this really make a difference? Any suggestions for easy ways to incorporate fats into my routine that might help my Accutane efficacy?\n\n3. I was on the same dosage for the whole course of Accutane. Ive seen some people in Reddit threads say their dosage changed or increased throughout their Accutane course. Does this really make a difference? \n\n4. Whenever I got a new prescription blister pack thing, I would take all the pills out at once and put them in an empty pill bottle so I didnt have to deal with the annoying blister packs. I saw a post mentioning that exposure to sunlight or being left outside of the blister packs might make Accutane pills less effective. Is this true? \n\n5. I take a lot of meds (vitamins for hair health plus antidepressants) and worry some of them mightve impacted my results. Specifically, I take bupropion, trintillex, and 5HTP for depression, and I often take supplements like biotin, folic acid, saw palmetto, bamboo/silica, horsetail extract, etc. for hair growth. \n\nAlso, if you can think of anything you did to improve your results, Id love to hear it.\n\nThanks!'"

It gave me a touch of a headache, which was easy to fix. I don\'t feel anymore like I need toothpicks to prop my eyes open during the day.

I used to take 120mg/day...\n\nThis is just a lot of stream-of-consciousness stuff.

Brand benzos work much better than generics. I do feel a bit guilty about taking ""an upper and a downer.""

They are actually on the conservative side. \n\nIs anyone else out there in psychotropic-land taking a benzo and a stimulant?\n\nThx...peace...\n\nPS:  He has me on a very energizing AD named protriptyline 60mg. When a shrink is dealing with narcolepsy/EDS, the flowchart states that you try something non habit-forming like protriptyline first.

I wanted to take a few 1mg Klonopin, 20mg Ambien, and crush a 54mg Concerta up and take about half of it (not snort). \n\n\nWhat do you guys think of this combo? Please dont give any lectures as Ive taken GABA drugs for years and Ive been prescribed these meds for over a year now. Im just curious if adding the Concerta will be pointless or if it will be interesting with the Ambien sedation? To be fair, Ive taken prescribed ProSom (Insomnia Benzo), Clonz Bars, and Concerta 54mg all at once before. The Klonopin is just used to chill and relax, play my game, and make the Ambien stronger. Anyways, what do you guys think of this combo and have you done anything similar?? Thanks!'"

When the numbing wore off, she noticed an odd sensation between #3 and #4, like it was too tight maybe and there was a sharp edge on #3, and bottom teeth were hitting #4 (that housed an old root canal from 10+ years ago) more than normal.\n\nSo, she went back in to remove the sharp edge. Tooth #3 was made shorter so then #4 got hit even more. The odd pressure sensation turned to irritation. Felt like something cutting into her gums. Back at dentist, the pain couldn't be localized (BOTH #3 and #4 reacted to pressure). On to an Endodontist who also couldn't localize pain - teeth didn't react to cold/hot. Few days pass  more pain. Asked dentist to remove the filling on #3. The next day, more tooth pain. Tension and pressure in jaw/ears and loud popping of jaw when eating. Start of TMJ symptoms. Got CT scan to check sinuses  all fine here. More pain in face - and horrible pain on #3 and #4 when tapped. Filed down tooth # 3 and #4 so no weight was hitting them. Felt almost immediate relief to jaw/face and tooth??? Which seemed strange.\n\nEndodontist still couldnt localize the pain. xray said pulp canal on #3 very large and could be hitting the filling. Told to wait a bit longer. Pain continues - and losing appetite/weight/night wakeups/ nausea\n\nPrescribed Nortriptyline 25 mg. Pain continues and went back to do root canal on #3 with endodontist but when numbed, she could still feel pressure, so maybe it was not the tooth itself, but nerve related. Trigeminal Neuralgia mentioned as a possible diagnosis. Later primary doctor said it was not Trigeminal Neuralgia but that nerve got hit and it would heal.\n\nBegan supplements to support nerve health: Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Inositol, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Vitamin C . Multi-vitamin. Vitamin D3.\n\nRelief for 2 days but then quit steroids, and woke up in tooth pain again. Saw a neuromuscular dentist who analyzes bite and deals with TMJ issues. She said right jaw was working VERY hard to bite. She said #3 and #4 were filed so short that they werent hitting at all. She relaxed the jaws and made  splint to keep the jaw in a more neutral position. She recommended a sleep study to test for apnea and then a custom orthotic device to keep the jaw in a neutral position (I am still debating ). She said it was a TMJ flare-up on the right side and fixing this could end the pain in my tooth.\n\nThe splint was causing more pain because it was hitting #4 so stopped wearing. Week 6, visted neurologist. He said it was for sure not trigeminal neuralgia type 1, MAYBE type 2 but doubted it. Said he would treat me as if it were TN2 and prescribed Gabapentin and stopped Nortriptyline. Started to feel less pain after 1st dose of gabapentin.\n\nSaw new dentist, for another opinion. Suggested maybe it was a nerve ganglion affected when injecting lidocaine during the initial visit way back when. If so, it should heal in 2 - 6 months. Got an ozone injection into the right nerve ganglion ??? which helped pain temporarily but then came back. Went back to get 2nd ozone injection. Pain stayed about the same, maybe a bit less (trying to figure out if ozone caused pain to improve last time or the Gabapentin + Nortriptyline). Wore mouth guard for 3 hours but caused some mild pain in face/ears so took guard out. Pain in face/ears increased. Restarted Nortriptyline and continued Gabepentin\n\nTalked to old dentist from many years ago before this all happened, she said it sounds like a failed root canal on #4 and that its just old and presenting in a way first endodontist wasnt familiar with. Recommendations was to get root canal redone or the tooth removed.\n\nAny ADVICE/IDEAS ???? The pain has been relentless . Open to ideas and thoughts - anything to relieve the pain! Maybe take the tooth out??  I've also heard roots can grow back so root canal redo?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ti2g8vr9dw31.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=503999e3539eb92de98956a80190ec70c3323fdb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iardv8vr9dw31.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e7bb0242ad4bceab4c4a302bf1c25b2d0a310ec4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ljkgelvr9dw31.jpg?width=1168&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=91dba2a939594fdee4d002b357cc30462e661290\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/puqso8vr9dw31.jpg?width=1168&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fc49ad3671544d2ca17b001504f45ca86f44111c"""
codeine problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/hjzlvf/my_5_months_journey_with_sciatica_and_how_i_got/,b'My 5 months journey with sciatica and how I got better',,"b'*Disclaimer*: this post covers a sciatica caused by herniated disk in the lumbar region. This is the most frequent cause of sciatica. All my observations may not apply to sciaticas caused by other factors. Also I am not a doctor.\n\n# Who am I?\n\nI am a 45 years old male and I got sciatica after lifting at the gym. My core strength was insufficient for my squat weight and depth and I got an hernia that pinched my nerve in January of this year. On the weeks after, I had 10/10 pain for several hours a day (in the morning) and this laster for weeks and even months. Its now July of 2020, and 5 months later I am getting much better.\n\nMy nerve is still sensitive and I have to be very cautious of my posture and my movements. But I mainly live a normal life. I can\'t jog or do most sports, but I can walk, workout (with caution), do gardening, seat, drive and do most casual things painlessly.\n\nHere are my takeaways:\n\n# I changed my lifestyle\n\nI almost never sat for months because I did not want to bend my back and cause pain. Sometimes I would not even seat for meals and I ate while standing. I also would limit getting in and out of bed to the bare minimum. I purchased portable urinals from Amazon so that I did not have to get up at night to pee. Life changing!\n\nFor me the best position was on my stomach on the bed. I lied across the bed, my feet and head hanging. I\'d put bellow under my chest or my belly, depending on the pain. I\'d have an iPad laying on the floor for entertainment.\n\nI mainly slept on the back without pillow. Some other mentioned sleeping on the floor, it did not help for me.\n\nSo do not try to continue living the same lifestyle that enabled sciatica in the first place. You\'re lifting? Stop. You\'re sitting all day? Stand up or lie down on your stomach. Youre bending your back all day? Stop and learn about spine hygiene (search for the book Back mechanic). Try to continue living your life as is? The pain will continue or worsen.\n\n# My sciatica fixed itself but it took time\n\nIn my case I did nothing but rest, stand, walk and lie down. I almost never sat, never did any specific workouts or stretches.\n\nLets say you broke your arm. Do you do stretches? Do you workout your core? Do you take painkillers? Nope. You just immobilize your arm and let nature do the work.\n\nThe same goes for sciatica. You can take painkillers at the beginning when its very tough but dont get used to it and stop as soon as possible. They will not cure you. They will instead become addictive and allow bad movements.\n\nYou basically need to rest and perform the least amount of movements that induce pain. For as long as necessary. Be very wary of miracle stretches or exercises that you find on Youtube. Would you do the same for a broken arm?\n\n# I got emotional support\n\nSciatica comes with sometimes unbearable pain. This takes a toll on your mental health. You need to have moral support and people to talk to. Could be friends, family, counselor or all of the above. Do not keep it to yourself. Being in pain and being alone is very tough.\n\nI had a lot of pain in the mornings. Usually I had to walk 1 or 2 hours before the pain would ease up. I took the habit of calling a friend or a colleague at that time just to have my brain focus on something else. Also it was during quarantine, so I kept doing the sessions with my shrink but we did them over the phone and talked about pain exclusively. Pain is so tough on you. It seems so unfair! So you need to talk this through.\n\n# I changed things and had to be patient\n\nI was very lucky to be able to work from home, and standing. I put my laptop on the kitchen counter and worked standing like this for months. Also I could take time off often. Because the pain is so tough, sometimes you can really find any interest in anything. So be gentle with yourself.\n\nSciatica is a serious injury. Do not try to push trough it. Stop what you are doing. Stop going to work if it makes you seat all day or do manual labor thats painful. Yes it might take months. Yes you might loose money. Yes people could resent you. Yes you might loose your gains at the gym. But if treated well, your sciatica will be fixed in months... sometimes faster! Ignore the pain? It could take years. Or you might have to get surgery.\n\nRegarding your job. It\'s tough to say and also tough to read, I guess, but if you must loose your job, just accept it because for instance, you just can\'t continue to carry heavy stuff with sciatica. Or it will last years and years. Same for plumbers or masons. If you guys have severe sciatica, you will probably have to change job. Or at least stop until it gets better. That\'s very unfair and very bad, but do you want to suffer endlessly and get addicted to opioids? Your life is more important than your job. You might loose a lot but living in pain is worst.\n\n# Pills were mainly useless\n\nI took AINS (diclofenac mainly) and light opioids (codeine mainly). Those are mostly useless. I guess people tend to think they work. Hell, maybe for some people, they do. Me, I took them as mental aids mainly. I told myself that if I took them, Id be OK. After 2 months of taking them I knew it was a bad thing a wanted to stop. It was hard. I tried it several times but could not do it.\n\nSo, one time I just quit cold turkey and was in pain for a week. But then the pain eased up and painkillers where no longer necessary.\n\nAgain, if you are not provoking pain by ignoring or masking it with painkillers, it will get bearable and slowly disappear.\n\nRegarding walking: its good but do not over do it, especially at the beginning. The consensus is that its bad to stay in bed and do nothing. So most doctors recommend to do some walking. I kind of agree but be very careful and do not provoke too much pain.\n\nRegarding medication and pain, I highly recommend this article that was very enlightening to me: [https://www.ismoc.net/nopillsnopain.html](https://www.ismoc.net/nopillsnopain.html)\n\n# I did not get surgery\n\nSome people need surgery. If you have the worst forms of sciatica and cant pee or take a dump or if your leg goes numb or if the pain is just constant and horrible then its a solution.\n\nBut most sciatica are not like this. The pain is very tough but thats it.\n\nThe scientific literature is pretty clear on this point. Avoid surgery if you humanly can. After a few weeks, the outcome is the same wether you had surgery or only rest. So rest and be patient and do not succumb to the idea of getting your back butchered.\n\nAs for myself, when the pain made me cry, I would have asked people to stab me in the back even if there was a 1% chance that it would have worked! But pain is an horrible adviser. Surgery works but makes your back more fragile. You might very well need more surgeries down the line. Look it up.\n\nDo not cause pain, rest and dont get surgery if you can.\n\n# Doctors are mainly ignorant of the nature and the pain caused by sciatica\n\nIt\'s very important that you get an MRI. Most sciatica are caused by a bulging or herniated disc. But not all. Also it\'s useful to know it looks like in your spine. That\'s basically the most useful thing doctors can do for you: prescribe an MRI.\n\nLet\'s face it, most doctors don\'t know a lot about sciatica. Most will prescribe painkillers and that\'s about it. To make it simple: most health professionals will provide exactly what they\'re known for. GP\'s will provide drugs. Chiropractors will provide manipulations (which are dangerous, you should NOT go and see a chiropractor with a sciatica). PT\'s will provide you with some massage but mostly core strengthening exercices. Surgeons will push you toward surgery.\n\nThat\'s the issue with sciatica. There\'s no holistic approach. You will get contradicting advice and treatment. For me, the best sources for a correct treatment are McKenzie (ex: [http://sqhillchiropractic.com/images/McK-1-05-1.pdf](http://sqhillchiropractic.com/images/McK-1-05-1.pdf)) and McGill (search for the book Back Mechanic). I find McKenzie more inline with my philosophy because he doesn\'t prescribe workouts. Just light stretches and posture corrections. Which I think is more inline with my ""rest first"" philosophy.\n\nTo summarize my treatment, it was basically the following:\n\n* rest on my belly\n* do a lot of walking / standing\n* do almost no seating\n* no back bending or bad back hygiene\n* no workouts, stretches\n\n# My pain often changed in nature and severity\n\nMy pain was always changing. The feel of it. Sometimes it would feel pointy and stingy, sometimes more deep and scary. But also the location. Sometime my calf would hurt, sometimes my butt cheek. Could be my foot, could be my thigh.\n\nIt was difficult to understand. Why I am in a lot of pain now and yesterday was better? Well I don\'t have any answers but my guess is that it\'s normal. Also the weather plays a big role. A cold and rainy weather will make my pain worse.\n\nAlso I walked a lot and probably too much. My hernia-induced sciatica morphed into a piriformis syndrome. The piriformis muscle is a flat, band-like muscle located in the buttocks near the top of the hip joint. When your sciatic nerve is irritated it can make that muscle painful. So because of this issue, my pain changed, increased and lasted longer. When I cut walking time, it very quickly got much better.\n\nI walked up to 15km / days. I had to cut to 3-5 km a day at most and my sciatica got much better.\n\n# When it got better I did physical therapy\n\nI did visit the PT after the quarantine was over. My pain was more manageable at the time. My PT is very good (I still visit him every week) because he took things slowly. Did massages first and treated my piriformis muscle by extending it mainly to relax it. After this we started some exercise, mainly to improve muscle strength and mobility of the core. Now it\'s getting tougher and we are doing almost traditional workouts with core exercises mainly.\n\nI don\'t know if I would recommend doing PT sessions on the first weeks when the pain is debilitating. Especially if your PT is not used to sciatica. Maybe some redditors can comment on this issue.\n\n# My conclusion\n\nThe scientific literature seem to agree with my own experience. Rest and the change of bad habits, posture and movements seem to be the best treatment. I understand that it might seem like a better solution to ignore the pain with meds and then get a surgery because it allows you to go on with your life as is. However longtime treatments with painkillers are not a good thing whatsoever and back surgery is a serious intervention that can lead to complications and might necessitate new surgeries down the line.\n\nThis is quite difficult to picture in our world that a health problem might only require patience. However if you look like things like even a cold or a flu, most drugs do not really accelerate the healing. The merely dampen the symptoms. And even that is maybe not good, as some people think that inflammation is a useful function of the body that actually contributes to healing. Same goes for sciatica in this case because it\'s caused by inflammation.\n\nSciatica is very hard, that\'s the thing. But most people are healed after a few weeks / months. So get emotional support and be patient. I got healed as many of us on this sub have. You got this.'"

I, 14F, have struggled with severe depression for upwards of two years- as a result, I have attempted suicide by overdose three times. However, all of these times were over a year and a half ago...is it possible to still have side effects, ie vertigo, from such a long time ago?

I'm in a much better place now mentally, and have been in treatments for the last year, but I never seemed to be able to figure out why I was constantly dizzy, until my therapist suggested that it might be vertigo. The reason why it was so difficult to come to a conclusion about this is because I also began struggling with anorexia at the time (again, things are much better now), which, for obvious reasons, will induce dizziness. But, now I'm wondering if it's due to my frankly long-forgotten attempts at overdose. I haven't told a doctor, as my physician is...not my favorite, and I haven't had a psychiatrist appointment for a while, so I figured I should ask here for insight.

This has lead to me many times stopping my meds as I felt better. I know this is NEVER the right thing to do, but I hate meds at all cost. When im sick like today, any meds i would digest would end in the toliet 20mins later. \n\nThis GERD like diagonse required me to drop out of school in March of 2010 due to I couldn't make it to school in mornings, grade's dropped, and I was a Senior and dropped my Senior year. Adds to depression. Since March i been a homebody, either my stomach causes me to stay in or anxiety. I have not chilled social with friends since June of last year. Max of maybe 5 people at the time? \n\nI been to GI docs in my area, the best of the best I could fine. ( I am home all day, internet is my best friend so I research a lot). Saw 2 different docs at the specialist. Each gave different meds. One said the meds I was on was way to strong for a 19yr old kid (dexilant) now im on (pantoprazole).\n\nMy question is, what do I do next in my life to move on? I feel my stomach is never gonna get better as everytime I see the doc or do more searching. Last time I was at the docs he said i had a anxiety related stomach to nerves. AS of last time and last thing I heard from the doc.\n\nI'm sorry for this long post also sorry if /r/depression wasnt the right area, I did not see a stomach or GED type forum. Plus im depressed...

Also occasionally numb if I do certain stretches. The biggest lately is this weird swelling on right wrist almost like its a veiny line popping out which often happens after certain stretches or movements. But not a ganglion cyst according to doc. \n\nHad mri which was mostly normal but doc told me some white fluid was detected in right wrist compared to left but again no ganglion cysts apparently. \n\nTo quote mri analysis: (right wrist) demonstrate very slight increased peritendinous T2 signal in the third and fourth dorsal compartments at the left wrist at the level of the distal radius which resolves more distally and is not present at the musculotendinous junction proximally .. also later tendons are intact without longitudinal increased T2 signal in the intrasubstance of the tendons.

NSAID problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/u2avlt/i_fucked_up_so_bad_that_i_could_have_killed/,b'I fucked up so bad that I could have killed myself by accident.',,"b""This will forever go down in history as the worst thing I've ever forgotten. \n\n\n  Long story short, my brain deleted the information that you should never combine SSRIs with alcohol or ibuprofen. I may very well have been reminded of this at points, but those also got deleted. Probably because I've been sick as fuck. \n\n\n  Recently I started back on Lexapro at 5mg which really rounded out the 40mg of Vyvanse I'd been on. They were working wonderfully together, no side effects. \n\n\n  Previously, I'd never held down a job for more than a year nor completed my high school education, pre-diagnosis. \n\n\n Things were on the up and up, I was developing routines again and actually felt like I had a brain for once, and then my doctor caught my platelets falling into thrombocytopenia during a routine blood check. \n\n\n  I didn't think I had any symptoms at the time save for a bit of extra bruising lately, but I have hEDS so what else is new.\n\n\n  Then I started to get *sick*. It felt like a flareup of the worst of my chronic illnesses. Night sweats, tachycardia, bloating and gas, joint and muscle pain, fever, fatigue- there's not enough room to list them all.\n\n\n  I stumbled upon a reddit thread that mentioned the dangers of combining antidepressants and NSAIDs (like ibuprofen), I looked up what else you shouldn't take with them, and now I'm sitting here feeling like a dumbarse.\n\n\n  So here's the worst bit. I'm annoyed with myself now, because I was medicated and didn't bother to read the leaflet in the Lexapro box, but do you know why I didn't?\n\n\n  Because I'd taken it before, years ago when I was 17. I'd been prescribed it for severe anxiety during late high school. I didn't have to worry about the alcohol warnings because I couldn't drink. \n\n\n  I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until I was 28 years old, and certainly not medicated before then. I had next to no chance of remembering this.\n\n\n  Of course I also forgot about the warnings about NSAIDs in the leaflet when I was 17, so good chance I took them at some point. \n\n\n  At 18 (legal in Australia) I also began to drink socially, but particularly frequently when I got a long term partner for the first time who had been drinking for a few years already. \n\n\n  From the age of 18, I had begun to suffer from gastrointestinal issues which progressed to chronic fatigue syndrome, malabsorption, chronic pain and made my mild food intolerances go from 0-100. \n\n\n  At one point, I was put on baby food by a dietician because I was so limited with what I could consume without symptoms that she was concerned about malnourishment. \n\n\n  Of course, after my symptoms had progressed to that point, it was very clear that I couldn't tolerate much of anything, let alone ibuprofen or alcohol, but neither I nor anyone else made the connection. I saw dozens of practitioners. I don't know how we all missed it. I'd been taking Lexapro for 6 years. \n\n\n  I was so ill that it eventually lead to divorce with aforementioned partner, after only 3 years of marriage. I couldn't work, I couldn't study, I could barely do housework. It would take me 2 hours just to do the dishes and I'd collapse not long afterwards.\n\n\n  The fact that he didn't believe I was really sick was its own problem, so I clearly had other issues on my hands, but I'll never stop wondering if things would have been different if I'd never been sick. If we could have grown together through our issues. We were both under immense stress. \n\n\n  It has literally taken me _ten years_ of doctors and thousands of dollars in medical fees (I'm still in debt to this day) to heal from the damage done. \n\n\n  Now, granted I also have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome so I am particularly sensitive to the havoc the alcohol and ibuprofen wreaked on my body, but acknowledging that doesn't give me back my lost years.\n\n\n  I lost _everything._ I lived in my parent's shed for 4 months at one point because I had nowhere else to go after the divorce, no money and unable to work. A literal tin shed, in summer, in Australia. \n\n\n  Their 'house' was about the size of a trailer, they couldn't put me up anywhere else (they didn't even have a lounge room), and my cat obviously couldn't be kept in the shed all day so she had to be allowed outside. She was killed by a neighbouring dog 3 months in, not long before we were able to move. \n\n\n  Life is so wonderful now, but I feel broken hearted all over again, thinking of how long it took me to climb out of that terrible place of illness and poverty, and I nearly did it all over again. \n\n\n  Thankfully I am on a disability pension now, so I will never be in such a place of desperation again, but I could easily have put myself back to square one with my health. \n\n\n  This month when I started getting symptoms again, all it took was a single sip of beer. I got a nasty headache. I took a couple of ibuprofen. I got sicker, the headaches got worse. The beginning of another end. \n\n\n  I've worked so hard to accept my conditions, and I do love myself and respect that ADHD has always been a part of me whether I knew it or not. It's not my fault and you can only know things when you know them.\n\n\n But, for now, I have to say it one last time before I gather myself again. \n\n\n  **FUCK YOU, ADHD**"""

She went to the dermatologist and was prescribed Retin-A gel 0.25%. With the Retin-A, her acne got worse. I encouraged her to continue using it, explaining that it is common to purge when first starting Retin-A. By the third month, my daughter went from persistent acne to severe acne fully covering her face. It was so hard for her to deal with this. It seemed to be more than a purge and more like she was having a very adverse reaction to Retin-A.\n\nAlong with the extreme acne, she started to develop lots of scarring so we sent photos to her Derm who took her off Retin-A and prescribed Bactrim along with Epiduo (Adpalene and Benzoyl Peroxide). She started the Bactrim but was reluctant/afraid to continue the Epiduo as it was aggravating her acne, giving her the same results as the Retin-A. She continued with the Bactrim and stopped the Epiduo and added in Azelia Acid.\n\nSo her routine now is:\n\nAM - Rinse with water - Moisturize with Sebamed - Sunscreen, Biore UV Watery Essence - Take Bactrim\n\nPM - Wash with Vanicream somedays or with a benzoyl peroxide wash other days - Azelaic Acid - Moisturize with Sebamed - Take Bactrim.\n\nShe has just started her second month on Bactrim and we have seen a lot of her active acne clear up. She still has a lot of PIE so it looks like her acne is worse than it really is. Her Doctor wants to put her on Accutane. I am nervous to do this as I hate to see her have a really bad purge with going off the antibiotic along with the initial purge that often comes with Accutane. I am also concerned about the possible negative side effects from Accutane. The doctor said that if we dont want to do the Accutane, she can stay on the antibiotics for 6 months but when she goes off the antibiotics, it is likely her acne will come back. Her doctor seems to be in favor of the accutane and says that she can stay on the Bactrim for the first two months she's on Accutane.\n\nI don't know what to do. I am a bit nervous about putting my daughter on Accutane. Maybe she should just stick with the antibiotics for 6 months as opposed to going on accutane. Has anyone gone off antibiotics and stayed clear? What are your thoughts on Accutane? It is just so hard on my daughter to go from persistent teenage acne to severe acne that has scarred her face all within 3 months. At this point, she would be happy just to get her skin back to what it was pre-Retin-A. Unfortunately, with all the scarring, I dont know if that will be possible. Will accutane help the scarring? I also cross posted this on r/Accutane"""

I also have had brain surgery for a rathkes cleft cyst in 2018, which has left me with diabetes insipitus.\n\nSince I was young, I have always struggled with focus, weather it be in my personal life, as well as schooling / workplace. I'm trying my absolute best to try and do the best I can.\n\nOne probem I have always struggled with is my morning routine. It is almost impossible for me to be out of bed before 9, and if I don't have commitments, that turns into a easy 2pm+\n\nI've been trying to build some routine in getting out of bed and going. I find if I wake up and get going I'm alright. However, this has not been the case, where I either sleep through an alarm, wake up and turn it off, or wake up for a bit then go back to sleep. Sometimes that can be at a time I want to get up (7am), but I let myself procrastinate some more sleep or just watch tiktok on my phone\n\nThis is something that I really want to fix, as a Australian I miss out on a lot, as we have a early - morning culture around a lot of activities.\n\nThe main problem is the procrastination. I find when my alarm goes off I will procrastinate until the last moment if I have a commitment, and if it is something self passed, such as the gym, or university, it is even harder\n\nAny help would be fantastic. I currently take 70mg of vyvance, as well as Sertraline, catapres, minrin and crestor (however that one is being phased out as my cholesterol is back in order). I am booked in to see a psychologist, and can try to get back into my phychartrist, however my sleep doctor I can't see until October at the earliest (I'm preying for a cancellation)\n\nThanks All!\n(Also a reminder that I'm Aussie, just because we don't have some treatments, mainly to do with narcolepsy down under, the fact we get to ride kangaroos instead of driving makes up for this though )"""

Am I being unreasonable for cutting her off?\n\nBit of back story- \n\nI was an only child (just my mum and I) until I was 8. I had a reasonably normal childhood up to that point. Id spend a fair bit of time with my grandparents (mothers side) due to mum needing to work full time.\nAt this job she worked at, she met the man who would eventually be my step-father. \nAs a child, my biological father was not very involved, but I still had a bit of contact with him and his side of the family. \n\nFast forward- Mother and Step-father obviously get married. \nHe was an angry man, but then extremely kind at other times. I thought this was normal. \nThey end up having 2 kids, my brother and sister, 10 and 12 years younger.\n\nIt didnt take long for the the grooming and inappropriate behaviours to begin. \nAsking me to shower with him after school before mum got home, showing me how to wash myself, making inappropriate comments about my body and appearance etc. Mum was none the wiser. This lasted until I was 14 (I guess I outgrew his interests)\nThere was also physical and emotional abuse, for 10 years. I witnessed knives held to throats, threats of suicide and threats of murder. He never hit my mother but did throw things, yell abuse at her and restrain her (her words). \nMy parents also had 42 foster children in our care over 5 years, who were all high needs, who also made allegations of varying abuse from step father. Because of the children having high needs, I was often left to my own devices and forgotten about. Apparently this made me hard to love or be proud of, because I wasnt making good choices (she told me this today). \nShe never told me she loved me or was proud of my until I was 23 when I called her out in it- and said her love language is giving not saying. She began saying it more after that. \n\nI moved out at 18, and I finally hit breaking point one night. \nMum and I had been at a local club having some drinks after work, and she had separated from him a few weeks prior due to obvious ongoing abuse. I was proud of her.  \nWe had a arrived at my mothers home so I could pick up my vehicle to travel home (about another 25 mins away). As I walked through the house, I saw he was in her bed. \nI snapped. Walked out of the house and burst into tears and called my grandmother, and disclosed everything. My world turned upside down that night. \n\nWe moved away. Mum, siblings, me and ex partner moved 800kms away to my grandparents home to start fresh and heal. I underwent mental health assessment and began therapy. \nOnly 4 months after moving, mum said she saw on my Facebook that I had apparently left open- I was lying. This is not true. \nShe moved back to him that day whilst I was away with a friend. \n\nAt this point- I broke. I ended up in the local psychiatric ward, after stating to my grandparents I had every intention of KMS. i was only there 5 days over easter, but on my first night, my mother rang to abuse me on the ward phone for being a drama queen. \n\nI was 19. I stayed with my grandparents for the remainder of that year, but due to the small town mentality and no work, I moved back to my home town. I hadnt spoken to my mother until my return, and she was still with him. I suppressed much of those feelings and wanted to move on and reintegrated into the family, still living externally but keeping a close eye to watch my siblings who were still at risk. \nI learnt about narcissism, which is exactly what my stepfather is. \nMy diagnosis is C-PTSD and ADHD. \n\nSo- I fell heavily into drugs. \nWhen I was 15, I first was introduced to Codeine, due to working in a manual labour job and requiring pain relief to even walk after work. I took them accidentally think they were just plain paracetamol. Those pills were not prescribed to my mother or stepfather but given from a family member after major surgery. \nThey made me feel so good and relaxed. \nIt was my 13th year of opioid use in 2021. I went from codeine to morphine and oxy progressively. I had a car accident which resulted in some slipped discs and arthritic bone spurs, so I had access to opioids always. Benzos for the muscular pain. \nI also got into to party drugs and later, into the much heavier drugs. I was an ice/speed addict for 4 years, up until my own son was born. It was my only coping mechanism. \n\nI have undergone intense therapy, particularly in the last 4 years, and had progressively started not taking as many painkillers or benzos, with no particular reason why. This started about 6 months ago and I can only assume its because Im in a really good mental place, I am preparing for a surgery that will positively impact my life and also being a parent has made me very aware of my mortality. \n\nIn the last 2 weeks, I have been stone cold sober. I have quit vaping (3 years no tobacco, vaping 9mg of nicotine), all painkillers except paracetamol and nurofen as required and quit marijuana. \nThe withdrawals were painful emotionally and made me physically ill, and I wouldnt take it back. Worth every second. \nI have mourned (and often still do) the life I lead, and celebrating whats ahead. \n\nMy biggest challenge has been seeing things from a different perspective, and realising that my mother never protected me. \nWhen I was getting abused, she wasnt, so allowed it. \nShe abandoned me when I needed her. She didnt fully believe me until my sister disclosed 18 months ago and I am struggling to come to terms with that even though I thought it was resolved. She left my stepfather 3 years ago and has been no contact for 2 (siblings were still under 18 at that time). \nBrother disclosed physical assault for years and sister sexually assaulted also. This monster is pure garbage. \n\nAm I being unreasonable in how I am feeling? Ive had quite invasive thoughts through this process and I have actually cut contact with her today, because I need some time to come to terms with my new life. \nShe says I am bitter and selfish. \n\nI feel like she let me down. Her abuse began before they were married and she didnt leave. I know she was stuck in a domestic violence cycle herself. She was scared. \n\nAm I asking too much to have my feelings acknowledged and understood?'"

NSAID eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/c0l4gq/microdiscectomy_3_day_postop_check_in/,b'Microdiscectomy 3 day post-op check in',,"b""Hey everyone! I hope you are all having a relatively pain free day. I had a laminectomy and microdiscectomy 3 days ago on my L5-S1 herniated disc. I had my sciatic pain for 4 months prior and nothing seemed to make it better so I decided surgery was the only option I had left. Here's my story.\n\nThe week leading up to the surgery they said no NSAIDS, and I found that some mix between narcos and gabapentin seemed to help but only for a couple hours, and I limited myself to 3 a day, so the rest of the day was pretty painful. And without any anti-inflammatory aids it was a pretty rough week. Other pre-op things I had to do were get some labs, take some antibiotics, and shower with hibiclens a few times.\n\nThe morning of the surgery I was excited and terrified at the same time. But even just laying on the hospital bed waiting to get taken in, my sciatica was still bugging me so I wasn't having second thoughts at all. They put in an IV and started wheeling me to the OR and that's all I remember.\n\nI awoke with a bit of nausea and for some reason I could not stop shaking. It freaked me out a little bit but went away after a few minutes. The next thing I noticed was my sciatica was completely gone. My surgeon said my herniation was even worse than it was on my MRI and it was a good thing I got the surgery as he didn't think it would have healed by itself.\n\nI ended up staying one night in the hospital, they said some people go home almost right away, but I was comfortable there and didn't see the need to rush out. They basically just kept an eye on my vitals and gave me meds. They told me I could get up and use the bathroom or they would give me a catheter, that got me up quickly.  I had a couple visits from a PT and OT and they basically taught me how to roll out of bed, dress myself, shower, etc. They went over the rules, mainly no bending, lifting, or twisting for weeks. I bought some tools from the hospital like a grabber and sock aid and then went home. \n\nIt is now day 3 post-op and recovery is pretty slow. One big question and fear I had before surgery was what the pain was like. Basically the pain is less than my bad sciatica flare UPS and it only hurts when I move. Still no sciatic pain except for an occasional dull pain in my hip which I'm not that worried about. I can usually lay in bed in comfort as opposed to it hurting pretty much non stop before. \n\nThe hardest part is doing simple tasks without bending or twisting. I can do most things on my own, like I don't need help going to the bathroom or anything like that. Mainly just with reaching for things or lifting things. I can do stairs a couple times a day, and I can sit at the dinner table to eat, although not for very long.\n\n Pain wise, today doesn't feel much better than a couple days ago, and I was hoping for a little progress by now, so it's definitely going to be a slow recovery. They gave me pain pills for 7 days so hopefully it will be mostly gone by then.\n\nI'm very glad I did it, I can at least now see the light at the end of the tunnel. I just hope for a slight improvement in pain each day and increase my activity level a little each day. I hope to be back to living a somewhat normal life some time in the near future. I at least have hope again.\n\nIf you have any questions about the surgery please don't hesitate to ask.\n\nEdit: 5 days after surgery now. Sciatica still gone and the incision site is getting better. Starting to ween myself off my meds and try to get back to feeling somewhat normal again. I can go for short walks but still can't sit for very long. I've had a little nausea but mostly I'm just so tired. And I want to try to be more active but I'm not sure what to do with myself.\n\nEdit 2: 1 week since surgery and just realized how bad the constipation had gotten. Guess I wasn't taking my colace enough or eating enough fiber. I spent most of the day yesterday sitting on the toilet and feeling like hell, today I feel a little bit better. Stopped taking pain pills and for the next couple days will focus on digestion. Now I just have to figure out what is causing my insomnia, only sleeping a couple hours at a time is getting old. For the most part my incision feels good and try to walk a little more each day.\n\nEdit 3: 10 days since surgery and still have lingering hip pain when standing or walking. Doctor said it was normal for the nerve to wake up and could take some time to heal. Back pain from surgery is almost completely gone with some occasional pain when I sit for too long or move the wrong way.  Stopped taking all of my meds and hip pain is manageable without it.  My energy level and appetite is mostly back to normal. I can walk a mile+ without any issues other than the hip discomfort.  Yesterday my wife took me to run some errands and it felt good to leave the house, I was able to sit in a car with minimal discomfort.  I will still take things slowly and cautiously and continue no BLT. I will try to go back to work Monday since I am out of leave time but I am nervous about driving and sitting/standing all day.\n\nEdit 4: 2 weeks after surgery now and I'm back at work.  Driving isn't too bad if I can find a good position, but twisting still hurts a little and seems to aggravate my nerve so I still try to limit driving as much as I can.  At my desk I try to switch between sitting and standing every half hour or so but I still get a little tired.  I may work partial days this week and build up to working full days next week.\n\nEdit 5: 3 week update!  Still have a bit of a nagging pain in my hip, but it comes and goes and is pretty mild.  I can live with it for a while, and it's a good reminder not to bend over or twist.  My incision is mostly healed now, almost all of the scab came off yesterday.  I can now sit for an hour+ although I try not to.  But if feels good to be able to do little things like go out to eat."""
Advil problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/m5slfj/daily_headache_for_months_please_help/,b'Daily headache for months. Please help!',,"b""31 year old Male here.\n\n* Chronic headaches first appeared about 5 months ago as a mild pulsating pain in my forehead that would throb for a few seconds every 30 seconds or so. Then they appeared every afternoon. Then they were there when I woke up every morning. \n\n* Eventually I went to my doctor who thought it was due to my high BP (145/90 on average), so he **precribed me Amlodipine**, a low dose at 2.5mg every night before bed. That very first morning after taking it, I woke up headache free. \n* For the next few weeks I continued to be headache free, so was convinced it was my BP. I worked on lowering it through diet and exercise, but then the headaches came back - regardless of how high/low my BP was. There seemed to be no correlation. My BP is now consistently healthy. \n* A couple months into them returning, the headaches would continue to mainly appear in my forehead, usually the right side. It was never as painful as a migraine (which I had a lot of as a small child). It was just very annoying and sometime it felt like something was crawling around my forehead under my skin. A couple Advil liquid gels would get rid of it for the entire day 90% of the time. A couple days a month the pain would be so minimal that I didn't take any meds.\n* Around February the headaches stopped appearing in my forehead and only appeared in what felt like the center of my head and areas in back. Sometimes a sharp pain would appear on either side of my temples. My doctor said I could try increasing my dose of Amplodipine to 5mg each night. Shortly after, the headaches were less severe and I even went a few days without feeling the need to take Advil for them.\n* But then they returned even worse. Despite healthy eating, 30 minutes of cardio each day, and lots of hydration, I'm still suffering.\n* **My MRI, sleep study, and eye exam came back normal**.\n* It's worth noting that my headaches appeared about the same time my breathing problems did caused by GERD, and I continue to take Omeprazole every morning for that along with my Advil/Tylenol.\n* At this point, Advil and Tylenol/Excedrin are no longer getting rid of it for most of the day like they once were - which has me very concerned.\n* Headaches seem to run in my family. My dad used to get them almost daily and now takes 10mg of Amlodipine which has reduced them to around 5 times a month. My sister says she has to sleep on her side or else she'll wake up with them, and both her and my mom get ocular migraines.\n* I'm thinking it could be a kind of cervicogenic headache due to my bad posture and sitting at a computer most of the day, and being a side sleeper, but I don't have some of the other symptoms such as neck and shoulder pain. I'm going to start doing neck/posture exercises to see if that helps.\n\nI AM DESPERATE FOR ADVICE OR SOLUTIONS!!! I will honestly Venmo someone money if they provide me with a treatment that ends up being effective. Even more for a cure!"""

It all started after a big party and woke up next day extremely hungover. Progressively felt so bad I took myself to the hospital. Ended up with mono and strep. Have no idea how. Anyhow doctor gave me penicillin  had a horrible reaction, ended up getting a full body rash, then ended up with guttate. Started with small dots, then just got worse over the years. I'd say it's moderate now, as I have patches all over. Scalp being the worst, it's such a bummer!. Anyhow doctors are a joke when it comes to this desease. They laugh at me when I say I'm 90% sure I have this because I had strep and ask if they can look into getting my tonsils removed. They just shrug and say they have never heard of a thing. So been on steroids for years. So finally got fed up made a appointment with a Derm, got denied any treatment because I was told I had latent tb. So I leave the office confused as F. Asking how the F did I ever get TB, mind running wild. Went to my doctor got tested for tb about 5 times  all negative. So I asked them if they are giving me the latent tb test? I had 3 or 4 doctors say there is no such thing! Can u believe this? I did finally find one doctor that knew what the test was in emergency, but couldn't give it to me because it could get him suspended? Can you imagine? So I'm just like F this. Wtf. Then the pandemic happens. So now I think I have tb, I'm a strep carrier,  I feel like I have mono everytime I get a cold. Now I got to worry about covid, and I'm covered in psoriasis. \n  I just can't believe how uneducated some doctors are to psoriasis. I find it amazing that probably most of us know more about it then actual doctors. I've been put through the ringer....and I don't even know what to do anymore. I have a very busy job, 2 kids, a wife, and it's just work, family and sleep. Not alot of time to be running around trying to find answers from uneducated doctors.\n\n At my wits end. I won't give up on this, but wow....is it this hard for everyone else to get answers?  I bet it's even harder with covid around to get the help I need.\n\n Don't even know where to start anymore. Because I feel like the same thing is going to happen. I feel no confidence in doctors at this point.\n\n Still just as confused as the first time I went to the Derm..."""

Im 20, F, and around 135 pounds. I have so many random skin issues and every doctor I have been to says they are unrelated but I just cant fathom that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. For starters, Ive had seborrheic dermatitis since I was around 14 (have a whole bag of medication and nothing works, lately Ive learned if I sleep on wet hair my scalp basically turns to mush and scabs and bleeds like crazy. I've tried to wash it less and sleep with it dry and its helping more than any meds have.) \n2. Since I was 13/14 every 3 months probably I get this crazy rash of tiny tiny bumps around my lips. Its so painful and I have a cream (triamcinolone .1%) that will clear it up in about 3-4 days. Without it, it lasts around 2 weeks. If I can figure out how Ill insert some pics. Its not herpes, derm has said its a reaction from the sun mixed with Advil but I know thats not the case bc it has happened many times when I have not taken Advil or been in the sun. \n3. I have had shingles FIVE times. The first time was when I was 17 and the last time I got them was about 2 years ago. Theyve been on my legs and back. Never had chickenpox but dr says its from the chickenpox vaccine I had as a baby. Almost every time I get shingles I get thrush in my mouth and its horribly painful oh and in October I got my first yeast infection. \n4. This doesnt really apply but when I was 17 I got Zika after visiting Cuba and on my bday, I had thrush, shingles, and Zika all at once. \n5. Last year around this time I got pityriasis rosea. Mother patch started on my left ribcage and then tiny dots spread all over. \n6. I have pretty bad eczema, mainly on my arms (crease of elbow) and I use the same cream that I use on my lips and that helps. \n7. I am constantly getting random rashes that have no explanations. \n8. I have very very sensitive skin, new products constantly irritate it. \n\nSorry for such a long list but I had to include it all. I am pretty healthy, do yoga and am active. My only allergies are penicillin and I had a patch test appointment set up for this week but due to covid-19 it is not considered an essential so it was canceled.

This would cause my throat to feel itchy/sore and constricted and would cause phlegm in my throat and i would either have to cough or clear my throat.**\n\nAbout a week ago, I noticed **my neck is crooked. Instead of it being straight like "" l "" it is crooked like    "" / "" when I look straight on in the mirror**\n\nI changed my posture and straightened my neck and immediately my congestion seems to get better. after doing this for a day when I woke up and straighten my neck again, My congestion almost completely went away.\n\nNow I am remembering something my eye doctor told me about 5 years ago. That my vision is weird. One eye sees great far but terrible close, and the other eye is the opposite. Sees terribly far but good up close.  He said because of this, I don\'t need glasses yet because one eye compensates for the other but I might have neck problems later on. My off setting vision might cause me subconsciously to tilt and crane my neck in weird positions to try and see clearer. He was right, I did not notice how crooked my neck has gotten over time.\n\nI told all this to my nurse and she nodded like she understood and said off handedly something like **"" Ahhh.. I know. Your Neck has shifted and its probably causing your tonsils to rub against something in your throat that it shouldn\'t be rubbing against.

Everything made sense to me.\n\nWhen my doctor came in, I told him the same story and the doctor said he has no idea why looking down or in different directions would cause me to cough.  He said it might be a neurological issue and prescribed me Gabapentin. He said to give it a try and see if it helps and also referred me to a voice specialist to help with learning how not to cough.\n\n**It seems like the nurse knew what was going on when the doctor didn\'t.** I\'m not sure what I should do at this point.

I was originally diagnosed with ADD in high school and prescribed Adderall XR 30mgs. I was on it the last couple years of high school and lost a tremendous amount of weight. In all honesty I'm not sure if the medication worked or not because I can't remember high school at all. Memory is a huge issue with me partly due to the ADD and partly due to the Adderall. Anyways I just stopped taking Adderall when I was 18 and that was that. \n\nWell in the last year I had really started to notice that I couldn't stay on task. I have absolutely no energy, I can't for the life of me find motivation or will power to do anything other than sleep, watch tv, sit around, and worry about all the things in the world I have no control over. I do not suffer from depression in the slightest. Probably one of the happiest and positive people I know. I started a job I absolutely love as an insurance agent and I am so good at it. Unfortunately I was having a hard time staying on task or finding the motivation to talk to clients or do anything at all other than surf the internet my memory had gotten so bad I couldn't even remember things that happened or conversations from moments before. I went in and had substantial testing done. MRI, CT scans, and a Minnesota personality test. Here is where I was once again diagnosed with ADD and mild anxiety disorder. The doctor explained to me that I was unable to make new memories because I was basically constantly distracted. \n\nHere is where they started me on the Adderall instant release \\(Last November\\). It worked beautifully at first. I had so much energy and motivation. I thought I could rule the world. Then after a couple of months that all went away and I became a literally zombie. I had no personality \\(I'm normally a very personable person\\) and my job got so hard to me. I couldn't hold conversations with clients. I couldn't build a rapport. \n\nAfter several dosage adjustments me and my doctor just decided that Adderall wasn't for me. At this point my doctor gave me Vyvanse 40mg. \n\nLet me tell you how much I love the Vyvanse. I have energy. I'm not a zombie, I tend to stay on task longer. However every single day exactly 7 hours after I would take my meds I would get an insane headache. This was the only side effect but it was nearly unbearable. \n\nI went in 2 weeks ago and talked to my doctor and he ended up prescribing me Wellbutrin SR 150mg twice a day and celebrex for the headaches. So far I am absolutely loving this combination but I am kinda crashing around 2 everyday. \n\nI guess my question is have any of you been in a similar situation with meds. What is the best time of day and spacing for taking these 2 meds so they are working at their maximum potential? I have tried to call and talk to my doctor but he isn't easy to get on the phone. I've read that some people take the Vyvanse and their first does of daily wellbutrin at the same time in the morning. I've read some people take the wellbutrin first in the morning and take the Vyvanse later in that day. I've also read that some take the vyvanse then wait until it is working at its max to take the wellbutrin. I've never had to take 2 meds like this so I'm really just not sure. \n\nTLDR: What is the best times and spacing to take Vyvanse and Wellbutrin SR to maximize its effectiveness?"""

I have recently joined a clinic where I have inherited many fibro patients on high dose opioid therapy with little to no multifactorial pain management strategies incorporated into their care plans.  I have seen that this is mostly due to noncompliance on the part of the patient, and I have seen many referrals over years to specialists (Neuro, Psych, Rheum, and PMR). Over the last few months, I have tried my best to ensure that I send in referrals for specialists and encourage them to make appointments and stay compliant with appointments, activity regimen, sleep, ect. . I have explained countless times that Fibro is a multifaceted illness that requires adequate sleep, mood stabilization and treatment of coexisting anxiety/depression, proper nutritious diet, regular exercise, and stabilization of comorbidities. Many of my patients are not having it. I explain to them that a degree of opioid therapy may be beneficial, but that it is not first line treatment and sole use of opioids (especially in high doses) in management of fibro is not an efficacious or safe treatment. I have had some sucess with starting some patients on Lyrica or Cymbalta, and in some cases amitriptyline and I have been able to taper opioid doses on some of these patients. However, the vast majority of them become extremely upset when I mention tapering, alternative therapies, and follow-up with other specialties.  \n\nHas anyone had sucess with tapering high dose opioids in Fibro patients, and if so, I would love to hear your advice on how you've helped your patients decrease their MME/day and kept them compliant with outside specialties to manage their chronic conditions.

It also happened to be during graduation so unfortunately I look like crap in all my graduation photos and I don\'t want to see them because I cringe everytime I see them. In August last year I went to a doctor and she gave me tetracycline. After about a month of tetracycline it did get better, almost ""perfect"". During this time I was also travelling around the world so in february I ran out of pills. My host family in New Zealand managed to get me more pills but only enough for me to take one pill a day instead of two. I continued on one pill a day and things started getting worse. Now the last few months my face has been ok. I mean, it\'s still bad but it\'s better than it was last summer. My back has gotten worse though, a lot worse. It\'s so bad that I can\'t wear white or bright t-shirt, can\'t wear tank tops, can\'t do squats in the gym because it hurts too much putting the bar on my acne-infested shoulders.\n\nA few weeks ago I went to the doctor again and she booked a time for me with a dermatologist. The dermatologist didn\'t even hesitate to put me on Accutane (or Isotretinoin as it is called here now). I took my first three pills (3x20mg) a few hours ago. I haven\'t noticed any side effects yet I think. My eyes are a bit dry but they get dry some late evenings usually and my lips are a little bit dry too but that can happen sometimes as well.\n\nHopefully things will get better now. I\'ll try to take some photos tomorrow of my back so you can see and also so that I can keep track of the progress.\n\nBy the way, I wonder, how bad can the muscle and joint pains be? I mean, I do work out quite a lot (2 hours four-five times a day). Normally I don\'t get very sore the days after, just light/moderate DOMS but will it get unbearable now when being on accutane? Has anybody combined accutane with weight lifting?\n\n**Update 2014-08-10** Five days in now. My knees and elbows have been hurting a bit, especially a few days ago, but it\'s manageable. My muscles aren\'t getting more sore now than before so that\'s good. As for the skin, my face is a little drier but I put moisturizer on my face and body lotion on my back every day so it\'s not bad at all. Haven\'t noticed my lips getting dry yet. The worst side effect is probably my eyes. They are dry, especially in the evenings. I find it hard to stay up for long since my eyes start getting really dry at like eight or nine o clock in the evening. I\'m also feeling a bit tired in general but I don\'t know if it\'s the medicine or something else causing that.\nI haven\'t noticed any improvement at all when it comes to the acne. It has gotten worse, especially in the face. But I\'m patient and I hope that it will turn better soon.\n\n**Update 2014-08-13** A bit more than a week in now. My face is getting incredibly dry and I\'ve had a massive outbreak in my face the last few days. Yesterday I showered at the gym after the workout but I forgot to bring my moisturizer, big mistake! I had to rush home as quick as I can to get hold of some moisturizer to put on my face. I was afraid my whole face would crack if I opened my mouth or smiled or anything. Right now I have to put moisturizer on my face about 10-15 times a day, lip balm just as much. My back is fine with getting lotion only once a day. My face has been really painful yesterday and today, can\'t open my mouth too much, can\'t smile and so on. It\'s been getting a little better the last few hours now so hopefully it\'s even better tomorrow. I had a look in the mirror just now before going to bed and my back is a lot less red than it used to be. The pimples are also less swollen and red, they\'re just small white things now, at least most of them. Something I didn\'t expect was my mood to change. I get sad/angry a lot easier than before and life just feels tough at the moment. I am a little bit nervous as well, moving cities on Saturday, which means I will move in to an apartment with two other people. I wont be able to make the first impression I want to make, but I guess I\'ll just have to explain it to them... Starting university on Tuesday next week, hopefully my face looks a bit better by then, because I wont be able to explain it all to hundreds of people. I just hope nobody will judge me for what I look like at the moment. I hope they understand the pain I\'m suffering and I hope they wont stare at me or ""remind me"" to wash my face more often or some other bullshit.'"

Was told to take the wrapping off 4 hours later, wash it with soap, and moisturize it (every 4 hours). Ive healed tattoos before with zero issue, once with Saniderm and once without. It looked great the 14th. It looked great the 15th. The 16th the skin started getting super tight and pulling, and the black still looked good, but something was off about the red ink. The center of the bursts of red were pulling away from each other and leaving holes? This kept progressing until there was basically no skin in the red, and my leg started getting irritated and painful with some signs of pus. I kept washing and moisturizing as she said and it was still really tight and hot and uncomfortable. By the night of February 18, I knew I had to go to Urgent Care or the hospital. \n\nThe morning of the 19th, I go to Urgent Care. Its infected and Im diagnosed with Cellulitis. Sent home with Clindamycin to take for 7 days, and Ibuprofen to take as needed. Told to rest and elevate my leg to help with swelling and pain. She also tells me to start using Eucerin cream and wrapping my leg in saran wrap for a few days. By the end of the 7 days, all of the redness is almost gone and those open pieces of skin have scabbed over- great. The 26th I feel better and am ready to move on. Wrong.\n\nThe 27th I am good all day and then when Im crawling into bed, I notice that my leg is a little itchy under the tattoo. I feel like its the red healing so I scratch around the bottom of the tattoo, near the ankle, completely avoiding actual tattoo. \n\nI go to sleep and wake up and notice almost a rash around the tattoo? Not actually around the tattoo but where I scratched a few inches away from the tattoo under and to the left of it. Its like a light pink color and I think its from scratching and maybe going too hard with it while I was sleeping. I thought it would go away once I moisturized and calmed the skin a little. It just irritated it more. I go to work and Im on my feet all day so I assume that its going to be red all day anyway. I get home and shower and look and I have a rash developing all over my body at this point. The leg is getting worse and itchier, and now my thighs and arms have a kinda similar looking rash. I take an antihistamine and go to sleep to see if that helps.\n\nWake up the morning of March 1st with no improvement, so I go to Urgent Care. I explain the situation with the provider there, he looks at the tattoo area and then looks at the hives all over my body and says Im having an allergic reaction and he thinks its to the Clindamycin  He said he isnt 100% sure but it would make sense in the timeline of things. He doesnt believe my tattoo is infected anymore and thinks all the redness I have now is because of the medication allergy and my violent itching of the area (which he absolutely told me to stop). \n\n\nI got a steroid shot in my hip (the most painful thing ever), and get sent off with a Prednisone prescription. Its now 2:30 AM on the 2nd and I have a 6/10 headache preventing me from sleeping and a whole bunch of nausea. My lower leg and thighs are also so itchy. Im not supposed to take the Prednisone until around 9-10 am because I still have the steroid injection in my system. \n\nI am so frustrated with this entire situation and just want it all over with. I work in body care and Im so self conscious of walking into work tomorrow covered in rashes, along with feeling like garbage. I cant soak to help the rashes because of the tattoo healing. They said go back in 3 days if theres no improvement but I will go to the ER at that point instead and hopefully get hooked up to something stronger. \n\nHas anyone had success with Prednisone for skin eruptions from antibiotic allergies? Is it normal for me to have such a bad headache and nausea at this point after a steroid injection or are they unrelated?'"

Sure it wont work as good as occasional use where you can really feel it but thats the self control part to not take more and only your prescribed dosage. \n\nI went from not leaving my house for 3 years to being able to feel somewhat alive again and feel like a human being with life goals and hope.'"

I feel like Ive looked into most probable causes and come up empty. \n\nHeres what Ive looked into:\n\n- Weight: Im in the healthy BMI range (510, 160 pounds, female, 29). \n- Thyroid testing: my results said I have healthy and typical thyroid function. \n- Blood tests: these came back normal without any causes for concern. \n- Exercise: I leisurely walk almost daily and do cardio for half an hour 3x a week. No strength training. \n- Diet: I eat fairly healthy 80% of the time, indulge the other 20% of the time. I eat 12-7pm and dont eat late. I rarely drink soda, and I dont drink caffeine. I never have alcohol (cant stand the taste). \n- Healthy Habits: I dont smoke cigarettes or vape. I dont take any (recreational) drugs. I meditate frequently, read daily, like to watch TV, and have no problem relaxing. \n- Relationships: I have a small but close circle of friends. I have a great relationship with my husband and an incredibly supportive, close family. \n- Stress: I have an average to low amount of stress. \n- Job: I generally like my work even though its not perfect. I work 8:30am-5pm. I get along with my coworkers. My role and my office environment are low-stress. \n- Oversleep/naps: I dont sleep more than 8-9 hours on weekdays (11pm to 7/8am). I dont nap during the week. \n- Sleep schedule: I nearly always fall asleep and wake up at the same time Monday through Friday. I dont think I carry any sleep debt into Saturday and Sunday. \n- Sleep quality: Every app Ive tried, and my Apple watch, tell me my sleep quality is 90% or higher. \n- Sleep study: Ive taken one sleep study on-site at a sleep center. I was told my sleep was normal and restful. The only piece they mentioned was I talk sometimes (husband can confirm). They said I definitely dont have obstructive sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or hypoventilation syndrome. \n- Sleep environment: I sleep in a dark, quiet, cool room free of distractions. No screens, I charge my phone in another room and there isnt a TV in my bedroom. I use an actual alarm clock. I keep the fan on for subtle background noise. My husband is a restful sleeper. We have a comfortable and supportive mattress, high-quality pillows, and cotton sheets. The only things I do in my room are sleep and intimacy with my husband. \n- Sleep apps: before I took my phone out of my room at night, I tried the ones that record your sleep then wake you up at an optimal time. Its supposed to be according to your circadian rhythm and where you are in your REM cycle. \n- Mental health: I have very mild depression that Im getting treated for and doesnt hugely affect my daily life. It was tougher and more severe in my early twenties but Ive been managing it well for awhile now. \n- Medical conditions: I have no other known medical conditions and havent had any serious or recent injuries. \n- Medication: Im on 20mg of Celexa (depression) and 50mg of Spironolactone (adult acne) daily. I havent noticed any difference before these and have been on them for years. \n- Water: I drink a lot of water during the day but cut myself off around 8pm. I usually get up to go to the bathroom once a night.\n- Sleep conditions: I dont meet any of the criteria for these (according to my doctor). \n\nWhat I dont do well:\n- Waking up at the same time every day, meaning the weekends. I almost always go to bed at the same time (11pm) but I let myself wake up naturally most weekdays. This is usually between 12 and 2pm. \n- Naps: I often fall asleep later on in the day on weekends. They range from 30 minutes to 3 hours. I have no problem falling asleep at night despite this. \n\nMiscellaneous Information:\nI dont have trouble waking up most of the time. I feel refreshed and restored upon waking. Throughout the day, I often start to feel tired and sleepy. I have no problem focusing though. \n\nSince childhood, Ive always craved more sleep. I started noticing wanting to sleep this much when I was around 18. My sister has been diagnosed with Idiopathic Hypersomnia, which I dont meet quite a bit of the criteria for. I dont know of any other sleep conditions in my family. \n\nIf you made it this far, thank you.

Also... what the heck just happened to me?""",Image916.jpg,"b'Hello all. I have had temporary fillings in two molars for almost a month. Here\'s what\'s going on:\n\nAppointment 1, October 8th: I got a filling replaced after which I had pain and sensitivity where there had been no issue before. I gave it time hoping it would resolve. This did not appear to be due to the bite. Also, my masseter was injured during this appointment.\n\nAppointment 2, November 6th: When I went in a month later, the dentist looked at the xrays and offered to fix it on the spot with SDF. He did not make it clear to me that a temporary filling would be used afterwards, requiring another visit. In addition, not only did he drill out the offending tooth, but the one behind it as well. I was horrified.\n\nAll of this happened AFTER I asked him to be explicit about what he was doing (he initially didn\'t even tell me he was going to use SDF, just ""I\'ll put some medicine on it that will decrease sensitivity."")\n\nAs it was a month since the last appt, I was able to get numb with the second type of anaesthetic for this.\n\nThe temporary filling was too soft as it had not been allowed to adequately set (I produce a lot of saliva, and my jaw was not opening well due to the strain from the first appointment.)\n\nAppointment 3, November 8th: I came in to hopefully just finish up the work since the filling wasn\'t staying. I couldn\'t get numb. After about 8 injections of 3 different anaesthetics, I still couldn\'t get numb. More temporary filling was placed, and it set well this time.\n\nI was in so much pain for days following. Headaches and diarrhea (side effects of the anaesthetic?) and my poor poor jaw and gums.\n\nAppointment 4, November 20th: I was hoping enough time had passed that the anaesthetic would work for me. I avoided caffeine and activity the day of and I took about a dozen Tums prior to the appointment (I read that increasing ones pH this way can improve the efficacy of the anaesthetic). I also asked for an anti-anxiety med as I read that can increase the efficacy of anaesthetic, but I would have needed that prescribed at an earlier appointment.\n\nThe anaesthetic didn\'t work. Then the dentist left the room and came back in with another needle, mumbled about ""trying this"" then he injected something deep into my face and I felt a hot ""wash"" sensation over the side of my brain. Immediately, my eye stopped tracking with my other one and I couldn\'t blink. Also, my jaw locked and we couldn\'t even open it enough to place a bite block.\n\nI begged him to just do the work anyways, but he refused. He said he wanted to refer me to another dentist that uses gas.\n\nTemporary fillings placed again, 2 days before thanksgiving.\n\nI\'m so lost on what to do. I just want to get this over with. The other dentist he referred me to is another low cost clinic that accepts my insurance. It would probably take another 2 appt at least to finish this up, and I live an hour away, this is getting very difficult and expensive. I feel like I may need to go to Mexico so I can afford to pay to get put under (I need a root canal anyways, would love to get it done all at once)\n\nPlease, what would you do in this circumstance?\n\n[This was repacked with temp filling 6 days ago.](https://preview.redd.it/cktlhuwxmr021.jpg?width=883&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d592d8906af0b849d5341d23f1b0ae645db0a026)'"

I have issues with substance abuse but one of the main reasons I use illegal drugs is because they make me focus. I used to be prescribed Adderall and vyvanse and Xanax and that combination helped me so much. I was like a D average student in high school until I got on medication and then I ended up passing with all As my junior and senior year with all As and I did a semester of college with all As and then I had a seizure and then later found out I have epilepsy so my doctor yanked my meds because it was a liability for him because those drugs lower the seizure threshold. After that my life spiraled hard. Smoking and drinking and a couple other occasional recreational drugs at times turned into a full fledged addiction. Drinking and doing hard drugs All the time. Alcohol became a rudimentary adhd drug. I lost all of my relationships and friends and ended up getting into legal trouble. I switched doctors and I stupidly told them I was using drugs because I was so desperate to tell someone and then they wouldnt prescribe any controlled substances. So now it just feels like my life is in free fall. I also have dyslexia. Reading one page of a book is a massive challenge. I cant hold a job because I cant keep up with everything.

This might help ease some of my depression.\n\nFor an entire year, I have been dealing with chronic tailbone pain when I sit down due to dysfunction in my pelvic muscles. Because of this, I have been taking Celebrex daily (NSAID) and while I haven't received any serious side effects of this daily use, I am afraid that it could happen at any time without any warning. This causes a lot of my depression because I'm afraid. I'm in fear everytime I swallow that pill. It's cripping and also contributes to my anxiety. Anxiety then further perpetuates my depression.\n\nIn PT I am given a procedure called dry needling where they basically stab your muscles in the region to get them to behave properly. This is something that is done in increments as to not upset the balance too much at one time. I can say without a doubt that my pain levels dropped significantly after just the one session, but were not completely gone. I am beyond excited for this second appointment, because it may provide enough relief that I can stop taking this painkiller.\n\nFingers Crossed!"""
acetaminophen problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/26c5eb/ravenous_appetite_on_concerta/,b'Ravenous appetite on Concerta?',,"b""Hi folks, \n\n   I searched but I can only ever find the *opposite* of my problem. \n\n   I started **Concerta 18mg** on Wednesday. I have noticed some benefit, particularity slightly better ability to focus during schoolwork, however I have noticed that in the evenings I'm experiencing a *huge* crash. I feel like a complete zombie...Furthermore, I have an **appetite that cannot be satisfied**. I *do* eat during the day, even though I'm not hungry at all, really, so this is proving to be an issue by the time night rolls around and I can't stop stuffing my face. I've also had a massive migraine since I started. \n\n\n Any idea what's going on? Is this going to go away? I can't really afford to gain weight (already overweight, and have already had significant weight loss). \n\n\nThoughts?\n\n**TLDR: 25 y.o female - started Concerta 18mg Wednesday, can't stop stuffing my face at night. Help.**\n\n*Edit: With regard to the migraines I mentioned - it lasted four days. I had been avoiding caffeine since the start of the Concerta because I feel I shouldn't mix the two. I thought it'd be okay since I had been on ~600mg/day and had weaned down to a max of 200mg/day prior to starting this (self-medication, I guess?). I was wrong. I have in today and took 1g of Acetaminophen, 325mg Aspirin and 100mg of caffeine, a well-known migraine-defeating cocktail...and it worked. I think now perhaps it was more caffeine withdrawal than the Concerta itself. Unsure about the hunger issue yet, as it's still morning.*\n\n\n**TLDR Edit: Caffeine withdrawals = migraines.**\n\n**EDIT: Should anyone come across this in the future using the search - now on 54mg in the morning (Concerta still) and no longer hungry. Like...ever. Perhaps it was dose-related. Felt as though it wore off ~6 hrs after taking. 54mg works much, much longer for me.**"""

acetaminophen swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/10fw2oq/homeopathic_post_oralsurgery_treatments/,b'Homeopathic post oral-surgery treatments',,"b'I had a gum graft and wisdom tooth extraction today.

The procedure went extremely smoothly and I am so far not in much pain. The one thing I was very disappointed with is that I was given some homeopathic post-surgery care, the StellaLife oral post-surgery care kit and arnica pills for reducing swelling/pain. The periodontist does also have me on conventional medical protocols for the procedure such as antibiotics and a chlorhexidine gluconate rinse, and they did still recommend conventional painkillers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, yet I can\'t help but feel insulted and confused that I was also directed to use homeopathic products that have little evidence as to safety and efficacy. I am inclined to just do what my provider tells me, since it seems to have ""worked"" for their patients all this time. I am trying to just assure myself that at worst these treatments will do nothing, since homeopathic products are generally too diluted to have any positive or negative effect anyways.

I took a break from all my meds after going out of state for college and not being able to find a psychiatrist almond other reasons.

Ive felt absolutely disgusting for maybe 3.5 hours now (?). So nauseous I think if I move Ill definitely throw up. (complete side note: I have very severe emetophobia and feeling nauseous makes me very anxious) My heart is not only racing (I checked and I think its about 110-120 bpm) I also feel like its beating out my chest- I can feel it throughout my whole body- and I feel hot and cold and then hot again and then cold. \n\nThe whole point of me writing this was basically to just ask if this is because of the dosage being too high or something I possibly did?

And frustrated.\n\n1. I have lost my f/t hours at my job. The guy with whom I\'d be sharing 3 of my shifts with has decided that I am absolutely horrible to work with. Three hours into my first shift with him he called my boss and complained about me saying that I was refusing to focus and that I was defensive about the training. I was gutted. \n   1. This isn\'t the first time I have heard these two things about myself in work environments. There is a disconnect between my intentions and my actions because I do not feel defensive at all. I am trying really fucking hard to show that I\'m capable. That I\'m going to do a good job. And it presents EVERY time as me being a jerk, apparently. So then, I get terrified to do or say anything because I\'m not sure how to change my behavior so that I don\'t present as defensive. I may not seem like I\'m focused, but I\'m learning the stuff when I\'m allowed to do it. But the  dude told me I had to shadow him and just watch him do it. I tried to explain to him that I wasn\'t going to learn a thing until I was allowed to do it, make my mistakes, and fix them. I have to do a task the ""forward"" way, and then if I do make a mistake, I won\'t ever make that mistake again because I will learn the reasons for the steps of the task by fixing the mistake. AKA learning it backwards too.  When the boss told me that (We\'ll call him Dwight because he is exactly like Dwight from The Office)-when my boss told me that Dwight had called him, I was all, I\'m not the only one that Dwight treats like this (which is true, no one else wants the shift that I just got cut from because no one wants to work with him)-and my boss said that Dwight wasn\'t the only person that was saying this about me. That all of my new colleagues were saying this. About which I was gutted.  And then after that I was scared, terrified, to go back. So a person who had been training me before had just been diagnosed with covid. So I lied and said I had covid. My doctor put my on Ativan because I had one of my panic attacks in front of her. I\'m so disappointed in myself for being someone that people don\'t like to work with. \n   2. Because I missed work with ""covid"" I needed to cover the graveyard shift for 4 days. At the end of that 4 days  I messaged my boss and said, so I forgot to print out the schedule, I assume I\'ll be on swing shift this next week. His response was no that he just wanted me to do two graveyards shifts on the weekend because he needed to hire a supervisor to mediate swing shift when he isn\'t there. \n   3. SOOO now my hours have been cut. My rent is due in 4 days and I don\'t have the money for it. \n   4. I\'m getting a therapy animal but I\'m afraid now to tell my landlord because even though they can\'t kick me out for that, they CAN kick me out for being late on rent. \n   5.

I have to clean it before I get the animal. I started to.

OH and I forgot to sign up for a wait list lottery for housing assistance. because of my fucking ADHD. I tried to do it the day it opened but it was so overwhelmed with traffic I couldn\'t get through so I was going to do it later and forgot about it completely.\n   9. I am pretty sure I\'m trans and I am going to want top surgery but my insurance won\'t cover it unless I quit smoking-and I have to not even use nicotine therapy-I have to be without nicotine for at least 6 months before they will even consider me for surgery.  I have been smoking since I was 10. Why? because I was a girl-a very smart girl-with very controlling and abusive parents-so I was FLAMING ADHD but masked SO WELL that I had to seek stimulants somewhere and my parents smoked so I was able to sneak them and not be noticed. I don\'t mean to excuse the self-medication, that\'s just what many of us do. I mean I was also in the country and in the 70s/80s so no one was ADHD-they were either brilliant at masking, or were ""bad"" kids.  A quick aside: I watched so many freaking BRILLIANT kids get lost because they weren\'t able to fit into the meat grinder well enough.  I\'m still angry for those boys. Maybe even more so than angry for myself. \n   10. I am paralyzed. What I should do is (first and foremost) turn the damn news off-ugh. Then I should just start with one thing. one thing. I tell myself. ONE thing. and then I\'m sitting there playing some stupid solitaire game on my phone-and chain-smoking.  Yeah. I know. I KNOW. \n   11. OH and I haven\'t eaten in about 15 hours. And I don\'t feel like cooking because my room is such a freaking mess it\'s almost impossible to get around. \n   12. AAAAAH! \n   13.

Multiple doctors & haven't found what's wrong""",,"b'29 year old female - below is a very detailed overview of my health. I am looking for anybody who can potentially lead me in which direction I should turn to next.\n\nShort Version: I\'ve had the same chronic pain in my left upper abdominal quadrant for 3 years, since March 2020. The pain is primarily located anteriorly just underneath the rib cage in the mid-clavicular line. The pain seems to be gradual throughout the day, with it being pretty severe at night, depending on what I am doing or how I am sitting. The pain will occasionally radiate to the back, up towards the sternum, and down towards the pubis and the groin on the left side. The pain is mostly positional, meaning I can relieve it by standing up, walking around, or lying down because it is most severe when I am sitting, whether that be driving, on the couch, at a table, etc. There is nothing that takes my pain away other than adjusting positions, but mostly laying down. No pain medications relieve my pain. (a detailed list of things I\'ve tried for pain will be at the bottom) I have had multiple imaging studies including a CTA of the abdomen/pelvis that showed possible Nutcracker syndrome with a 17 degree angle between the aorta and SMA with dilation of the left renal vein. I was evaluated by UW Madison for consideration of an autotransplant of my left kidney. However, after I underwent a venogram which showed equal pressures between the renal vein and IVC, Dr. Foley did not want to offer the surgery.  \nI also have had irregular menstrual cycles since I began having periods. Within the last few years, I feel like I almost get the ""period flu"" or have more PMDD symptoms before I\'m about to get it.\n\nLong Version: This all started in March 2020, my office had just moved to working from home with the Coronavirus outbreak. I hadn\'t gotten a desk/office chair for home yet, so I started out by sitting on my couch with my laptop in my lap for a couple of weeks. After about 3 weeks in I started to notice a bad pain in my left side. It was like a pinching/burning pain and it seemed to come on slowly the more I sat in the same position. My immediate thought was that it was like a ""side stitch"" or a cramp from the way I was kind of slouching and not sitting upright in a chair. I quickly made sure to get a desk and chair to see if it helped resolve the pain. Unfortunately, it did not. The more the days went on, the worse the pain was getting and it only seemed to be when I was sitting for longer periods of time. I had to start getting up more frequently and walking around or switching positions. I went to a chiropractor which did not alter the pain in any sort of way. The same chiropractor also tried a few laser therapy sessions over the affected area as well, with no relief.  \nThe pain was gradually becoming a permanent thing, and it became painful to wear a bra due to the pressure it caused around my ribs/where the pain is. I was trying everything I could think of to relieve the pain. At first I tried ibuprofen, Tylenol, heat, ice, heating pad, icy hot, cbd muscle rub, cannabis,  \nThe pain continued on and I started talking to my then primary doctor, I had an x-ray done of my ribs 04/2020 - which showed normal. I then had a chest x-ray and chest CT done 05/2020 - also normal. The pain continued through that fall and into 2021. I had c\\*v\\*d for the first time 11/22/2020.  \nIn spring of 2021 I had c\\*v\\*d again in March, so almost right at 90 days since first infection. I then started to get more serious about finding out what was wrong because I started to have a new pain in my left collarbone. It seemed like the whole bone would ache and the more I moved my arms(I had started cosmetology school in the fall of 2020) the worse the pain got. Sometimes the lightest touch from my shirt, a tank top, my cosmetology apron, or even my seat belt resting on my collarbone would cause immense pain. This lasted about a couple weeks at first, then it would go away for weeks/months, then it would come back randomly. I went to the emergency room one day in 03/2021 because I was so tired of being in so much pain, and had more chest x-rays done, which came back clear and normal. The collarbone pain has not bothered me for about 6 months now, but I have also been pretty sedentary since then. Fast forward to 06/15/2022 after my third round of c\\*v\\*d the beginning part of June, I started having the following symptoms for a month straight. I was physically so unwell, I could barely get up from laying down most of the time and could not go outside due to not being able to tolerate the heat, until I finally asked my doctor to run more labs, which all came back normal: dizziness, night sweats, severe intolerance to heat, severe loss of appetite and nausea, and new body odor(previously never had an issue with body odor). Since then, I have had periodic episodes that last weeks with severe loss of appetite(cannabis is the only way I can eat most of the time), some mild nausea(never any vomiting), lethargy, feeling hopeless, very mild night sweats, hotter body temperature while sleeping. And then I\'ll have weeks where I feel fine except my usual pain. On 01/26/2023 I traveled to Punta Cana for my sisters wedding. I suffered through the pain of sitting for an extended period of time on the plane ride. While there, I virtually had no appetite my first night and the next morning/afternoon. And then my appetite came back and my pain went almost completely away for almost 4 days, until I went back home.

NSAID problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/zlvvyl/i_feel_like_my_dentist_has_treated_me_unfairly/,b'I feel like my dentist has treated me unfairly; should I file a complaint?',,"b'I live in central NY. I\'ve been dismissed by my dentist for, in my opinion, advocating for myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\'m sorry it\'s such a long ride. The events below take place over about ten months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn February, I broke a tooth. I have a military service related back injury, and I collapsed on the floor one morning when a disc ruptured. I clenched my jaw so hard in reaction to the pain that I cracked a molar.\n\nI was in a great deal of pain and taking massive amounts of NSAIDs as well as prescribed hydrocodone. I did not notice any dental pain at the time. For this reason I scheduled a non-emergency appointment. Nonetheless, simply because it\'s excruciating just to walk to the bathroom, in a sense, I make all of my healthcare decisions under duress and am not always the best conversation partner. I explained this, and all of the following, to my dentist and his office staff, and I am certain that they understood what I was telling them.\n\nOver several visits it was established that I would need a root canal and crown. I explained that due to my unique work situation I was very strapped for cash and had just terrible insurance, performance-wise; and would need to be especially prepared for the financial side. He was very helpful, and he showed me how the procedures were billed and exactly what his office charges so that I would know within reasonable limits, barring complications, what I\'d be spending.\n\nWe discussed it at length; and how my insurance company would not pay for a root canal and a crown at the same time; and how if I was willing to play what sounded like a dangerous dance with infection I could do what many of his patients do, get the canal today and fill it, then get the crown next insurance year. But given how terrible my insurance is and how broke I am, I told him getting it extracted was my most realistic option.\n\nHe doesn\'t do extractions. He referred me to another doctor. That doctor was on vacation, so my appointment was scheduled over a month out.\n\nSome time later I got a fever, woke up drenched in sweat, and convinced I had COVID, called into work. The covid test was negative so I assumed it was the flu. My health worsened over the next few days until I was experiencing mental confusion and bizarre thoughts; and it suddenly occurred to me that my tooth (which still had not given me any pain at all) could be infected. This was confirmed by an emergency dentist, who pulled the tooth and prescribed antibiotics.\n\nEverything got better except for my job, which I lost due to the excessive sick time.\n\nBut the emergency dentist knocked out a crown that my regular dentist had made. They reattached it but advised me that without the extracted tooth, things may shift and if the bite was off I should go get it reseated.\n\nAfter all of this... the insurance company screwed it up anyway. And for whatever reason, it was nearly seven months before I found out I still owed the dentist a trivial amount (around $100). I received a ""final notice"" that I discovered in my mailbox on the way home from work. Since I live blocks away, I just got back in the car and walked into the office to pay the bill.\n\n(Bear in mind that I mean trivial *to a dentist*. To me, it means doing without something.)\n\nWhile I was there, I explained that I had not received any prior invoices, and that last I had spoken with the insurance company, it had been my understanding that the insurance claim was still being processed. I also re-iterated how distressing the entire incident had been very distressing to me how I thought I\'d done everything I could to prepare for the expense.\n\nThey can always call me on the phone. I live a block away. The dentist told me twice that *I* can always call *his* phone. Resorting to threatening my credit score is kinda bringing a gun to a fistfight, isn\'t it?\n\nWhile I was there, I said ""I don\'t think I\'m the first person who\'s had a surprise bill,"" to which the receptionist replied, ""no, you\'re not, and you won\'t be the last.""\n\nI said, ""but don\'t you want better?""\n\nShe seemed offended and said, ""excuse me?"" and I did feel bad about that so I clarified, ""I mean, don\'t you want for there to be no patients with billing problems?"" She said ""yes,"" and I tried to reiterate how frustrated it can be to deal with this kind of stuff while in pain. I apologized for ""wrecking their afternoons,"" or something to that effect, and I added ""but please try to understand it\'s wrecking my entire year and still isn\'t over."" I thought they understood and sympathized with me. I even vaguely recall being assured I hadn\'t offended anyone. I later came to gravely regret not recording the conversation myself.\n\n*and on an aside, I honestly do believe that if we all work together there are ways that we can build relationships with our medical providers; and it\'s not in everyone\'s best interests to simply ""do what the computer and policy manual say to do."" Maybe I\'d have explained that more eloquently if I wasn\'t always thinking about whether tonight\'s the night I blow my brains out because I ran out of vicodin.*\n\nMeanwhile I had developed pain in another tooth and because my dentist typically has very long appointment waits I called another nearby dentist who was able to see me that day. His assessment was that the original crown was compromised and that it needed to be replaced. He advised me, however, that it might be possible to remove adhesive and reinstall it without spending $2000, so I should call the dentist who installed it.\n\nThis morning, a number of months after the above took place, I called my dentist to schedule an appointment for the damaged crown. I was put on hold for a few minutes, and the receptionist came back and informed me that I\'d been dismissed as a patient. I asked why, and was told several things:\n\n* The doctor stated that I was ""angry at having to pay my bill""\n* The doctor stated that I ""became irate.""\n* I was being disrespectful to the office personnel.\n\nI then asked if the doctor had stated that I\'d raised my voice, or had used any specific or offensive language, to which the receptionist replied, ""any dentist is permitted to dismiss any patient for any reason?""\n\nI admit this kind of shocked me, and I did say one or two snarky comebacks, such as, ""do you encounter many people who are angry they have to pay their bill?"" and, ""does \\[dismissing patients for any reason\\] sound like good/professional business practice to you?"" But then I pointed out that there were two people in the office at the time, neither of whom was the doctor; and I asked if anyone who was present could comment on my conduct. The other party told me that they were one of those two people, assured me that they had not interacted with me (I distinctly remember making eye contact and thanking them for their patience), and said that they agreed I had been disrespectful and irate. I asked why neither of them had said anything at the time, and the reply I got was, ""I\'m not going to go around in circles on this. A dentist can dismiss you for any reason.""\n\nThey also reminded me multiple times of the ""late"" bill that I paid, in person, within minutes of receiving in my mailbox.\n\nI am also pursuing a registered professional career (engineering). A false record of my conduct stands in my dentist\'s office, which will one day be purchased by a conglomerate and integrated with their database, and I have, at least within a narrow professional sphere, been slandered. But worse yet, I can\'t get my teeth fixed. But underneath it all, it really feels like dismissing patients for systemic problems like billing delays is a very handy way for dentists and doctors to get rid of ""problem patients.""\n\nLet me reiterate that while I am kind of a tough looking guy with a very deep voice, at *no* time did I *raise* my voice or behave in a way that even approaches the definition of ""irate."" I am an engineer with two years experience dealing with ""irate"" buyers chewing me out about supply-chain-related shipment delays.  You can\'t keep the pedal to the floor 100% of the time.\n\nAlso: why was I dismissed today, while making an appointment, and not months ago when I was allegedly being ""irate""?\n\nSo esteemed dentists of Reddit, was my dentist\'s conduct appropriate? Was he fair and respectful? Does this warrant a complaint to the NYS Office of Professional Discipline?\n\nOr AITA for what I thought was doing my best to advocate for myself?\n\nThird option (sorry for all the edits. I am honestly a little upset over this. He\'s a good dentist): is there any way I can work this out with him? I honestly do not think this is an option given how I was treated by his office staff. I don\'t think it would be fair to force them to deal with me now that they\'ve made their opinions clear to me.'"

So idk what to think of this. Because I feel better but not at 100%. Keep in mind like 2 and a half years ago I was kinda diagnosed with depression/anxiety and been taking ads, xanax and also atarax on and off. And now my new psych tested me for adhd( which I suffered when I was younger and also took Ritalin for almost a year and concerta for like almost 5 years) and she prescribed me concerta and told me to lower the doses as I wrote.. so maybe it wasnt depression/ anxiety and just the adhd ?

antimicrobial problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/xg2xdh/a_couple_of_things_exposed_roots_biological/,"b""A couple of things: exposed roots; biological predisposition to excess calculus and hygienist's magic antimicrobial gel""",,"b""My first question is simple: to what extent are exposed roots problematic? I have had them for years and dentists have never commented on them, but I'm reading online that if there is any significant gum recession then it is actually a proper problem \n\nThe second is basically to do with things I was told ages ago and so can't remember half the details. I have always had fairly bad teeth, with significant amounts of calculus having to be scraped off every visit to the dentist or hygienist. My dentist always told me off for not brushing - and when I protested that I did brush my teeth enough, she would say it must be my brushing technique. But when she actually bothered to check my technique she discovered it was good, and concluded that I must be lying about actually brushing them - with me being like, well, that's nice, dear, but it's simply not true, so what is going on? Needless to say she just stuck to her unfounded point of view. \n\nNow, I remember at some point hearing something about some condition that affects some other body part (I did say I had forgotten details...) that often co-occurred with (and I think caused) poor dental health despite good oral hygiene practices. The condition was something that I either have or plausibly could have - which doesn't narrow it down that much as my health is not great (but the main physical issue is epilepsy; I also have endocrine issues being investigated). \n\nThen at some point the hygienist, after sorting my teeth out, applied some magic antimicrobial gel (or some substance, I don't remember precisely) to my gums. This, combined with my normal oral hygiene, kept my teeth actually clean for the next 6 months. I was given it on one other occasion and it worked then as well. What is this stuff? Evidently I need to ask for it every time (there were a few years where I didn't go at all hence me forgetting). I also wonder if the fact that it was highly effective for me indicates what it is that causes so much build-up in the first place? Is it strange flora, or excessively acidic or alkaline saliva, something like that? \n\n(I don't drink or smoke)"""

NSAID constipation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/12yy1kb/sciatica_meralgia_paresthetica_both/,b'Sciatica? Meralgia paresthetica? Both?',,"b'So my long story. Back in 2006/7 I started noticing an ""odd"" sensation in my lower outer thigh about 3"" above and to the left of my left knee when I exercised. Hard to explain. Not painful, not burning, just...odd feeling. I had some mild back and hip pain here and there. At the time I just attributed it to doing something wrong while I was working out and tried to be more careful. As time went on, the odd feeling started turning into numbness when I lay down and more pain/pressure in my lower back and hips. \n\nI finally went to a Dr about it in 2014 when it started becoming more than irritating and the area had gone from just a small area to the entire outer thigh. Laying down would make my thigh on icy/hot fire and pins and needles. It was pretty painful but nothing like I\'ve experienced over the past few years. Dr ordered an x-ray and said I had some mild arthritis that might be pressing a nerve when I lay down, mentioned the meralgia paresthetica, said to take nsaids, and to lose weight. \n\nFast forward through 9 years of it only getting worse and worse as I was dealing with other pressing health issues (and surgeries). At times it can feel like someone is hacking into my thigh with a lightning bolt- 10/10 pain when it happens. True agony. I feel paralyzed by the pain as even the tiniest of movements will make the thigh slashing feeling even worse. I literally move millimeter by millimeter until I get to a position that takes pressure off. Standing almost instantly makes my whole leg numb to my toes. Sitting slowly makes my leg numb. Sometimes I get numb walking. Pressing on the area is *very* painful. Sometimes the lightest touch will elicit the most pain. I used to get some relief from doing exercise/stretches like pelvic tilt, cat camel poses, leg to chest (and many other recommended ones) but they just haven\'t worked in quite some time. My back and my hips hurt, but I\'d rather have the back pain than the thigh pain. I\'d say back and hips are a constant 3-4 pain but can be bad if I bend over and/or stand up the wrong way. \n\n\nI finally got some sick time built up and saw a new PCP in March. She did some tests in the office and says I have bilateral sciatica, gave me Prednisone and muscle relaxers (relief was minimal), ordered an x-ray and EMG NCV, and referred me to Ortho. X-ray shows ""mild arthritic changes"" and EMG NCV show nerve entrapment in ankle. Ortho reviewed for tests, confirmed the bilateral sciatica, added si joint dysfunction, and ordered an MRI, which I have this Friday. She also mentioned cause for cauda equina when I mentioned my lifelong issues with constipation and some urinary issues but I don\'t think this is that. Neither mentioned meralgia paresthetica. \n\n\nI\'ve Dr googled both and feel like it could be both. Or started as MP then sciatica developed from something else. Does anyone have both? Will the MRI show anything about an entrapped femoral nerve? My biggest fear through all of this is my MRI being clear and told to just do pt. I\'m broke. I have insurance but it\'s still $40 a visit. And time. I just don\'t have it. I am diligent about doing stretches and exercises at home--Ortho approved, and they gave me free access to an approved pt video program. \n\n\nIf you\'re still here, thanks for reading!'"

On March 27 I underwent a laminotomy (hemilaminectomy) with decompression of nerve roots, including partial facetectomy, forminotomy and/or excision of herniated intervertebral disc; 1 interspace, lumbar. When I go for my followup on April 14, Ill be able to ask him just exactly what that means hahaha. By the way, eight days out, Im really happy I did it.\n\n**INFO FOR WOMEN**\n\nThought to put this up here so it wouldnt get buried: I ended up getting my period two days before the surgery. The timing sucked, but having it fall when it did was definitely doable and nothing to stress over. Just let the nurses know you have your period; theyll give you cotton underwear and a pad to wear during the surgery. Just bring some overnight pads to put on your underwear once youre clear to change and go home, post-op. The nurses will help you put them in place if you ask (which you should). It isnt nearly as embarrassing a thing to ask as you think. Related note: The nurses told me not to wear tampons after surgery. Even if I wanted to, there was no way I was going to be able to finagle that thing up there (its hard to bend forward a little/you of course dont *want* to bend forward). Pads are the way to go, for sure.\n\n\n**DAYS BEFORE**\n\nCouldn't eat or drink anything -- even water -- after midnight the day before my surgery. Also, youre not supposed to take any meds 10 days before the surgery. It sucked, because thats seemingly when my entire body started aching hahaha (headache, PMS cramps, back/leg pain, etc.). Go grocery shopping with someone if you can. Theyre good to bounce ideas off of. I bought small bottles of milk, boxes of orange juice, pasta, crackers  basically things I could keep at countertop level/things that werent super heavy. I also made sure to place everything Id need in short reaching distance. And any clothes I might want to change into, I put on the end of my bed.\n\nI also bought one of those grabber things that are sold at medical supply stores (which has become my best friend since the surgery haha); a shoehorn if I need it; and my grandma sent me one of those things that help people who cant bed over get socks on. I tried that sucker out a few days before surgery and I recommend it. But back to the grabber  I assumed I wasnt going to want to reach forward very far after surgery (I was spot on with that one). This thing helped immensely.\n\nInitially, I was all set to recover in my third-floor walk-up apartment (I have a seriously wonderful  roommate, but shed be at work until at least 5 p.m. each day). Friends who work very close to where they live kept offering to allow me to stay in their place (which had an elevator) because they could check on me throughout the day/keep an eye on me at night, but I didnt want to put them out. Id be sleeping in their bed and relegating them to their couch, after all. But listen to me: If people are willing to have you crash at their place for a few days, do it. I will go into the reasons below. But please, please, please, if you can make arrangements to stay with people, suck up your pride and do it. I know its hard (it was for me to relent, at least). Recovery isnt impossible alone, but having people there to help you is incredibly amazing.\n\n**DAY OF**\n\nI was scheduled as my surgeons last patient of the day. I was supposed to go under around 2:30 p.m., but didnt end up under the knife until about 5 p.m. It literally is one of those go to bed but wake up immediately after like nothing happened situations. Before surgery, my surgeon told me his portion would take about an hour and a half. Anesthesia was scheduled to take about an hour pre-op. By the time I was done and in the recovery area, I believe it was around 7 or 7:30 p.m. \n\nI was in and out of it for a few hours after. The nurses told me Id need to pee before leaving. They also said if I couldnt pee myself, theyd have to catheterize me. Well if that didnt get me moving\n\nGetting out of bed was probably my biggest worry, pre-op. I knew how to log roll, but I was (and remain, even a little more than a week out) petrified Im going to twist and undo everything. The nurses kind of minimized the fear for me. Getting up is OK. The nurses will help you, and will also walk you to the bathroom. Youll (hopefully) notice your lack of sciatica in this moment. I did, and it was amazing. Also, it took me what felt like 10 minutes (but was probably like 3 minutes) to get all the pee out. \n\nI was given something with fentanyl twice immediately after surgery, then eventually given something with valium, then, upon release, was given small doses of oxy. Even then, I was in some fair amount of discomfort. I wouldnt say I was in pain, but it was a mix of like a locked-up feeling, pressure, and some soreness. Getting into my friends car was tough, but OK. Getting to their apartment was fine. You just need to move gingerly.\n\n\n**DAYS AFTER**\n\nI wasnt able to sleep for the first 36 hours, post-op. Not sure why. I wasnt in agony or anything like that. In fact, across my lower back was just a feeling of pressure/soreness/stiffness, but nothing extreme at all. I guess I was just wired? I also didn't have an appetite, though I tried to eat anyway. This is where I got into trouble, and why I was happy to be with folks. I received two prescriptions for pain meds: Tylenol with codeine and tramadol. The tylenol wasnt doing enough for me  it was helping, but I felt I needed more  so I waited six hours from my last dose of tylenol, and I took a tramadol after eating some meatballs. Long story short, I threw up. All over myself and my friends floor. I guess my body couldnt handle 50mg of tramadol. If I had been alone, I wouldnt have been able to clean up any of it. It was awful for me, and probably more traumatic for my hero friends.\nThe stiffness/soreness truly does let up day after day. The first day after surgery, Id get up every four hours or so and just slowly shuffle around for as long as I could take it  around 15 to 25 minutes  then Id go back to the bed. Each day, I was able to get up more and move around for longer, albeit carefully. I stayed with my friends for three nights and four days. On that fourth day, I walked around the halls of their building, and practiced going up a stair or two. That night, I was able to return to my third-floor walk-up. I took the stairs veryyyy carefully, but was able to climb them no problem. It took me about 10 or 15 minutes, but I got to my door without immense pain.\n\nSince then, its gotten better. Im getting random twinges of burning down my leg, but its not holding me back like it did all these months. My ankle still burns, and sometimes my hip/hamstring get that familiar, though far lesser, pain, but its not like before. I hope/assume thats normal. Im just in such a better state than I was before. I didnt get my full appetite back until about five days post-op. I didnt do a great job hydrating myself the first three days. I just didnt feel like drinking water. Do a better job than I did. \n\nI took one week completely off of work, and set it up so I could work from home the following week. Im fortunate to have bosses that allow that. They tell me I can take more time from home if I need it. I havent decided if Ill return to the office next week or not. \n\n\n**THINGS I LEARNED**\n\n- Its worth it. Hands down. Price be damned (waiting on the final bill, assuming its going to be hefty, even with insurance).\n\n- Breathe whenever youre getting up/down/walking around. Seriously, dont hold your breath. A nurse told me this when I was in the hospital. And he was right  any time I held my breath trying to get up from bed it hurt a lot more, because I was tensing up.\n\n- Bendy straws, or just straws in general, are specTACular. Invest in some.\n\n-Get ready to be a little grungey. I wasn't allowed to shower until five days after my surgery. I won't lie, I was a little greasy lookin'. But when you can finally wash yourself -- hot damn.\n\n- Post-op, if you have even an inkling you might need to pee, get up and start shufflin' towards that toilet because it might take you longer than you think to get to it. If you wait until you deffff know you need to pee, it's going to be tough. You can't speedwalk to the bathroom, and you need to take your time sitting down on the toilet, especially after surgery. Hahaha the number of times I felt like I was going to pee myself because I didn't get up in time. Fantastic.\n\n- Bring your phone with you everywhere around the house/apartment/wherever. Just in case you need something immediately, or you fall, or you can't get up from a seated position (this one happened to me when I was sitting at my friend's table). Hahaha felt a lil' pathetic, but you can't help it sometimes!!\n\n- Let the surgeon/nurses know if you cant swallow pills. I somehow forgot to mention it until like 15 minutes before being rolled to the O.R. The surgeon was able to get me the tylenol with codeine in liquid form, which I cant tell you how much I appreciated.\n\n- I really cant recommend the grabber enough. It has helped me get things out of the fridge, pick up my clothes, helped me get dressed. Seriously, consider getting one before you go under. Mine is about 30 inches long with little suction cups at the end.\n\n- **Just because you feel better, doesnt mean you are completely healed.** Im now eight days post-op, and the soreness and stiffness has subsided quite a bit. Its now to a point that I need to consciously remind myself to continue to log roll in and out of bed, and go slow when sitting down and standing up.\n\n- Get comfortable with the fact that you need to go slow and treat yourself delicately for the first few weeks. I have trouble asking people for help. I had to get over that with this whole thing. Its hard, but its in your best interest.\n\nIf anyone has any question, please feel free to reach out! These are all just from my experience  everyones experience will be different."""

I debated about posting but reading other posts and the relief some felt getting issues off of their chests seemed therapeutic. Since mid January I've been experiencing Disequilibrium and imbalance (not vertigo). I first noticed it after I was bed ridden for 4 days after a bad neck twist while sleeping. Got an Orthopedic Pillow the day after it happened and basically rested while taking a Tylenol twice a day. Afterwards when I could move more freely I noticed an off balance sensation. Waited a few days then went to my doctor.\n\nAt first he thought it could be cervical vertigo and gave me Naproxen and Baclofen. Used both for a week. It helped with the residual neck pain, but imbalance symptoms persisted. In fact the Baclofen had other side effects. Went back to the doctor and had blood work done (CBC, Thyroid, etc) and did a neurological test in his office. Everything was normal except the imbalance. After looking at my ears and nose he prescribed a Betahistine HCL and Beclomethasone nasal spray. \n\nThe first day I followed the regime and used the nasal spray and took a Betahistine. The Betahistine had drowsy side effects and made the symptoms slightly worse, however I took it 3 times a day for a week and a half, noticing a reduction in the imbalance. I only took the nasal spray the first day and stopped due experiencing sinus pain/pressure in the face that evening. However the following day my nasal passage was more clear.\n\nI saw an ENT last week and he thinks it might be either an ear infection or Sinusitis and I have an MRI scheduled in late April. The Betahistine has been a weird experience, first making symptoms worse then slightly better and then finally worse. While on it I could feel pressure in my ears at night. However at the moment I am 40% back to normal.\n\nThis week after doing some more reading, and understanding the Sinus locations I think I might have Chronic Sinusitis. If I'm being honest with myself I've always had a mild fullness sensation in the face above the eyes and near the cheeks not mention a fatigue sensation in the last few years. It just became my new normal, so when I finally had the final symptoms of Chronic Sinusitis ie; Imbalance, disequilibrium and the Betahistine hasn't helped much, I decided to use the Beclomethasone spray again. I'll ride out the side effects if it can at least partially resolve my symptoms.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? If you made it this far thanks for reading.\n\nTLDR; Suspecting Sinus issues might be causing imbalance instead of an inner-ear issue.\n\n"""

My right nostril has almost completely healed and I can breathe fully out of it however my left nostril is still almost completely swollen shut/clogged on the inside and has felt like a bad cold/sinus infection ever since getting the surgery. \n\nI have gone to all my check up appointments since my surgery and my surgeon always assured me everything was healing fine but it just really feels like I should be able to breathe fully or at least not still be this clogged after 9 months or at least somewhat more out of my left nostril? My right one I can breathe fully after and have for a while now. \n\nI have slept propped up ever since surgery with a humidifier going on blast and used the correct non medical nasal spray but this has caused horrible insomnia since I can barely breathe in general but especially at night. \n\nIs this just part of the healing process or should I press on my surgeon more to re-evaluate it even though he said it was normal at each follow up appointment and healing correctly?

dicyclomine,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3hojh9/im_17_yearsold_and_no_one_knows_my_whole_story/,"b""I'm 17 years-old, and no one knows my whole story. It's embarrassing, but here it is.""",,"b'Hello, I\'m 17-years old, and I\'ve never told anyone my entire story. It\'s embarrassing. Not because of anything really bad, but I\'m embarrassed to be depressed by it. I\'ll try and go into as much detail as I can, and if I confuse anyone, please let me know. I want my story out there. The full story. I\'d like responses, but it\'s mainly about me just spilling everything. I won\'t release the names of people involved, but rather just the first letter or two of their name. And this may be premature, but thank you for listening.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, I liked this girl. We\'ll call her M. Late in the summer, I was introduced to a friend of M\'s that just moved back to Nebraska, and we\'ll call her P. When I embarrassed myself in front of M too many times and realized I wasn\'t going to get her, I started to move on. That\'s when I began to like P. I thought she was amazingly beautiful from the moment I saw her (as cliche as that sounds), but in about October was when I really started to like her. I had a class with her, too, so I got to see her every school day. So I asked my friend Av for P\'s number. (All of the people are females so far; I\'m a male) So I started texting P, and things were going really well. We were getting along great. We had seen each other at group hang outs a few times, but never really talked, but we were talking really well over text. In December, we both started to like each other. This was the first time I\'ve ever liked a girl who liked me back. I started falling for her really hard. In late December, we wanted to be together but wanted to go out before we made it official. So on January 1, 2014, I saw a movie with P. It was great. We talked quite a bit and hugged at the end. So we were then officially together.\n\nWell, we started talking to each other every day at school and we\'d hug every day. We wouldn\'t talk *a lot* during school since we only had one class together, but we would still walk to that class together and talk before and after class. Things were going well; I was happy.\n\nBut, there was something that went wrong. She could never hang out. She is Hispanic (I\'m not; pry not relevant) and has a strict mom and family, so she was never really able to hang out. We tried a few times, though. One time her mom said she could go bowling with me, and my parents were taking me there and we waited in the parking lot (my parents were gonna drop me off) but then her mom said she couldn\'t go, so I just went out to eat with my parents. It was embarrassing, but, I was still with her.\n\nThe school year went on. It was February 14, and I gave her a shirt and a rose as a present. In return, she gave me my first kiss as a present. It was great, and I was never happier. Then came my birthday, March 18. She didn\'t get me anything, but I told her not to. I loved her, and her being my girlfriend was enough. I really did love her, in my mind anyways. She was amazingly beautiful, but in more ways than one. Every aspect about her made me happy to be with her. Well, except that we could never go out. I\'d ask her really often and make plans with her, but she could never do it. But anyways, let\'s skip to when school got out. I thought we\'d be able to go out during the summer since she wouldn\'t be busy. But she ended up ignoring me a lot. Like, a lot. She\'d go three days without texting me every now and then. And on days that she would text me, it\'d only be a couple times. So within about 10 days she may send me 10 texts overall, probably spread across two of those days. I started going downhill. I thought about breaking up with her, but she made me so happy. I couldn\'t find anyone better, and I didn\'t want to try to.\n\nIt was the day Portugal tied with the US in the World Cup. We got into a really small quarrel, and she decided that we should go on a break. I asked her if she saw us able to repair things, and she said she didn\'t know. July 14, 2014, she broke up with me. I cried a lot, to say the least. I was lost. She made me upset, but I wanted her back. A couple weeks after, I deleted her number and went about a week or so without talking to her before she finally texted me first saying she got a new phone and thought I should have her number. We talked a bit, I still liked her. I told her I still liked her a few times, but she didn\'t see me like that anymore. I should also interject to say her past relationships had ended similarly as well. She\'d be dating someone and just lose interest. I knew that heading in, but I liked her too much to let that stand in my way. But I was someone she had liked more than anyone. She had kissed me more than anyone, she had felt things for me that she had never felt towards anyone, and I was the first person she ever thought she loved. When she broke up with me, she said the dreaded ""I love you, I really do. But not in that way.""\n\nIt was sometime in August when I cut for the first time. I took a small knife that we had in our kitchen, took it into the bathroom, and tried to cut my thigh and drew a little blood. I cut again a few days later. But knives didn\'t really work that well. I didn\'t have any single razor blades, so I had to use a manual razor. I\'d take it, put it on my skin, apply pressure, and slide to the side. I did it on my thighs, chest, upper arms, stomach. I liked it. I liked the blood. I still like the blood. I also became suicidal around June or so, I should point out. I\'m sorry if this is too sporadic, by the way. Hard to get all my thoughts in order. But I started feeling suicidal, but it was very mild. As time went on, however, I cut more and more and became more suicidal.\n\nI\'ll take this paragraph to interject and say that on the day P and I went on a break, her cousin, S, had talked to me. We\'ve talked nearly every day since, and S even tried to get P to hang out with me while we were on a break, but P wasn\'t comfortable with it. She led me on quite a bit during the summer and while we were on a break, and that made it worse.\n\nBut anyways, P and I started to get more and more distant from each other. We weren\'t able to talk well anymore, and we fought and stuff. This was all over text/Facebook message. I had sat by her in a class that we shared a few times and we were able to talk somewhat well. Well around December or so, maybe November, we really started to fight. She knew I was depressed, but she didn\'t really know about what. It started to make me mad since it didn\'t seem like she cared, and friends of mine even thought it was odd about how little she seemed to care. So I decided to stop talking to her, and I told her that. I told her that I\'d take some time off from talking to her because she upset me too much, and she said she was happy about that because she thought it\'d make me feel better. I blocked her on Facebook as well to ensure that I wouldn\'t see anything to do with her. I had set out to get over her. But after a few weeks, I broke down. I started to make contact with her again.\n\nWell actually, S, her cousin, had her contact me again because I wanted her to and P didn\'t want to. Around January or so, P even said that she was just talking to me because S told her to. But, I grew on her. By the time it was late last school year (April or May), P said that she still really cared about me. And I talked to her more about my depression and let her in a little. I told her that I cared about her a lot (but not that I still liked her) and that the fact that she and I weren\'t friends really upset me. I feel guilty that she thinks and knows that us being friends makes me depressed. I hate that she worries about me. But I\'m happy she does. I\'m happy she cares. But I feel guilty. Every day. This calendar year is also when I started getting more suicidal. I have taken pills a few times too. The pills don\'t do anything, but I do it as a suicidal gesture. I know they won\'t kill me, but in some ways, I don\'t know. I take ten ibuprofen or ten acetaminophen (sometimes it\'s been more, but I\'m not sure which one it was; I\'ve gotten over 15 pills at once before) before I go to bed and I still wake up in the morning. I started cutting more and more, too. I started having a lot more suicidal thoughts.\n\nP and I talk a bit now. She doesn\'t reply like she did when we were dating, but she apparently replies to me as much as she replies to anyone, so that\'s good. She can\'t talk to me in person though. I\'d love to be able to talk to her in person, but she\'s too uncomfortable. She doesn\'t really know why. I\'m a little uncomfortable with her too since we were never really friends in person before we dated. That\'s part of why she\'s awkward with me. She can\'t get over the way we used to be when we dated. I was only every really a boyfriend to her. I want to be friends with her now, but a big part of it is because I still want to be with her. But even so, I want to be her friends. Again, I\'m sorry if this doesn\'t make a lot of sense. I have a lot to say, and I didn\'t think to make an outline first.\n\nBut she and I talk, and i know she cares about me. She really does care about me, but she\'s promised me that she\'d change to be able to talk to me better because it\'d make me feel better and it\'d make her happy, and because she sometimes wants to be able to talk to me better, but she hasn\'t made an effort. Friends aren\'t important to her. She\'s super close to her family, so if she doesn\'t have friends, she\'s okay with it. Me, on the other hand, I\'m not close to anyone in my family. The only personal thing I talk to anyone in my family about is where I think I want to go to college. I rely on friends to be as close (and closer) as my family should be. So she and I still talk, and it\'s about average every day. She\'s not comfortable enough to joke around with me. We\'re basically stalled. She\'s told me she cares about me too much to never talk to me again. She also has said a few times how guilty she feels about how she ended things with us. Because that\'s part of why I\'m like this. A big part. It\'s all pretty much because I still like her, and I don\'t have a lot of closure. She did say, not too long ago, that I was a really good boyfriend, so that gave me some closure. She also said she sometimes wishes she never dated me because she knew she\'d end up hurting me. She\'s nice to me a lot of the time. Nicer than she should be at times. She\'s also done things that have really upset me. It changes a lot. Sometimes I don\'t think she really cares, and other times I\'m reminded that she really does. It makes me feel bad. I\'m just a burden to her, in my eyes. I\'m holding her back. I know she says I\'m not and I know I don\'t take up a lot of her time, but she says she worries about me. I tell her not to, and I have stopped talking to her about my depression to try and 1.) Be able to actually make conversation with her since we can\'t talk well to each other, and 2.) Help her stop worrying about me. I feel really guilty about making her worry.\n\nI even kind of changed my story about why I\'m depressed. I said that about half of it or so is the way things happened with her and I and the way we are now, but I also said that the other main part is because there\'s this girl I like and I can\'t like anyone but her and stuff like that, but she apparently doesn\'t know I\'m talking about her. I haven\'t told her I liked her since, shoot, pry before December, actually. Is it right for me to feel guilty about this? I really want to be with her. I know that\'s bad to say since we can\'t talk in person. But I know who she is as a human being. I know her really well, and I like her. For a while I thought it was just because she was really pretty, but there are a lot of girls that I should find more attractive than her (at least by my past standards) but I don\'t. I like her more than anyone else in almost every way. I just wish she could talk to me.\n\nNowadays, I think about killing myself every day. I most likely never will. I love my family and friends too much to do that. But I want to. There are times that I think about past events and future stress and my mind goes straight to ending my life. When I get really bored, I think about ending my life. I want to die quite a bit of the time. But a lot of my friends don\'t know that. Some of them know I have cut before, but only about one is somewhat caught up, and no one in the world knows this entire story. There are still tiny bits I\'m missing since I can\'t remember. I haven\'t cut in a while. When I do cut, it isn\'t for the pain. It\'s just because I like watching the blood. I still wish I could have a razor blade to cut with, though. I haven\'t taken pills in a long time though. I\'ve thought about different combinations and what it can maybe do. I\'ve thought of mixing dicyclomine with ibuprofen and stuff, but I\'ve been too scared. Like I said, I don\'t want to kill myself for the sake of my family and friends and my religion. The good thing, however, is that no one would suspect I\'m depressed. I\'m a funny and easy-going guy. I joke all the time and I put on a happy face. But I guess quite a bit of the time, the funniest and happiest are truly the saddest.\n\nI stress a lot, as well. My grandpa, who was my first friend ever and is still my best bud, could die any day. He was predicted, by doctors, to die years ago. He has a lot of heart and kidney problems, and I almost cry just thinking about him dying. I also stress over school a lot. And racing. And college. I don\'t have motivation for anything. My mom is mad at me for not having a job, but I\'m not motivated enough to get one. And just life in general since I\'m so stuck right now. \n\nI guess this is where I\'ll leave it. I still love the girl I shouldn\'t. I\'ve tried to get over her, but I can\'t. I\'m trying to be friends with her, and I know she cares. I think about suicide more than I should. Thinking about it gives me comfort. I don\'t know how I\'d do it. But I think about it. I feel guilty, and that makes things worse. No matter which way I face, it\'s the wrong direction. I can\'t be happy anymore, truly. I\'m living the life I brought upon myself, bearing the weight of my self-given onus. My constant state of dejection haughtily takes away all motivation I long for, and replaces it with thirst for darker paths. Completely lost in my own emotional dystopia, I\'m entombed into a cavern of my former self. It seems to be my life is cast away behind clouds of yesterdays troubles, swallowed further by tomorrows tears. Living the life of a darkened soul only comes easy if you cede to your altered temptations.\n\nThank you for reading. I\'m not sure how this will be formatted. I hope I didn\'t get too explicit with the self-harm, since I want my story to be heard. If it\'s a problem, I can take that part out. I really want to hear what people think. I don\'t know what I want to hear. I want this story out there, for me. Thank you for reading, and if I think of anything more, I\'ll add it. If parts don\'t make sense, just tell me.

Im F(15/16), half Thai so I got quite some melanin in my skin. I started getting acne at age 8/9 (by that I mean Im turning 9 that year). It only got worse and in November 2018 I started tetracycline, worked pretty fine, but after almost half a year of it and trying to go without it, immediate outbreak. I ended up using tetracycline until last fall. At a certain time I stopped getting receipts while I was waiting to get back to a dermatologist. Beginning of December was when I finally started isotretinoin after half a year of consultations. 2 first week I did 20mg every other day, and by the time I began taking one pill every day. The symptoms got wild.\n\nAbout 3 days before Christmas I started experiencing daily nosebleeds, sometimes 3 to 5 times a day. My skin was sensitive, red, flaky, my lips was always drying out, flaked, bled- even my eyes are dry, my throat is dry, I easily become hoarse, my fucking ass is dry. A lot of headaches, joint pains, my back is killing me on a daily basis (and I used to dance for 5/6 years). I got to lower my dosage to 20mg every other day again (Im technically about halfway into my accutane treatment), the symptoms arent too bad now, but Im still sensitive. \n\nIve grown sensitive to milk, something I once drank over a liter of on a daily basis- very fat dairy product upset my stomach, so does bacon out of all things. Another funny thing is cum. Yes you heard that right. I had an allergic reaction to someones cum. Just jerked an ex, got his cum on my hand, immediately stung. It BURNED, swell up, red, itched, like acid! This was in early January and I still have flaky skin where it reacted and it looks like eczema. I know of seminal plasma hypersensitivity but it is such a rare thing. Has anyone else here experienced this? TBH, it only got worse now since the covid lockdown, disinfectants, frequent hand washing- it really irritates and dries me out. It also made me think of how I dont look forward until summer. Last year I got sunburnt for the first time in my life. In my face. I live within the damn polar circle where it doesnt get much higher than 15 Celsius. That was while I was on tetracycline. What Im scared and relieved about is that my treatment is ending in sometime June.\n\nHave any of you guys dealt with anything similar or heard of? \n\nHow do you deal with overly sensitive skin? \n\nHow do you suggest I protect my skin in the summer besides the obvious sun screen (I got 50+ spf, UVB + UVA protection that is meant for the face and fragrance free)\n\nAny other suggestions or advice?'"

Didnt pay for labs since they were doctor ordered.  \nGenerally: \\~150 in supplies for side effects\n\n  \n**Product Routine: Less is more!**\n\nAM/PM- Mario Badescu spray, Neutrogena hydroboost gel cream  \n\n\n**Products:**\n\n**HG, die without:**\n\nMario Badescu rose & aloe spray\n\nNeutrogena hydroboost GEL CREAM (for extra dry skin)\n\n1% hydrocortisone cream- great for corner of lips\n\n  \n**Helpfuls:**\n\nAyr saline nasal gel with aloe- dry nose\n\nSystane balance- mild eye dryness\n\nSystane gel drops- longer lasting relief\n\nHydrocolloid bandages- overnight on recently broken whiteheads (Ie within a few minutes of breaking)  \n\n\n**Chapsticks:**\n\nChapstick medicated- 9/10, odd smell\n\nBooda Butter- 8/10, needs a lot of reapplication, light and matte\n\nAquaphor- 5/10, good for extreme dryness, bad taste, shiny, doesnt stay on lips\n\nChap-lip lip balm- 10/10, cheap knock off, works as well/ better than chapstick, and tastes better\n\nVaseline lip balm- 7/10, does alright, dont like tintVaseline- 7/10, layered over aquaphor overnight, wears off, does an ok job\n\n  \n**Hated Its:**\n\nCerave Hydrating Cleanser- stopped after a few days, burns my skin on accutane\n\nAquaphor (tub)- too thick for face, didnt keep with it\n\nNeutrogena oil free sunscreen- white cast, pilling, sweat turns it white, began to burn after a while.\n\nNeutrogena hydroboost WATER GEL- heavily perfumed, doesnt hydrate as well  \n\n\n**Other product issues:**\n\nCerave cleanser bar/Cerave PM Moisturizer (With niacinamide) These both caused my skin to flip out and break out into closed comedones in month 5. Stopped after 4 days and returned to older routine.  \n\n\n**Side effects, when and how I handled them:**\n\n  \n**Chapped lips**\\- within week 1, any chapstick you can find (menthol kinda burns though), remove dry skin by gently exfoliating with sugar and olive oil Cracked lip corners- hydrocortisone 1% solves it overnight  \n**Dry skin**\\- within 2 weeks, moisturize with oil free, non comedogenic moisturizers on face, whatever on body  \n**Baby purge**\\- 2 weeks, a couple new breakouts mostly around my mouth. Once burst, put a hydrocolloid on overnight, purge was done in 10 days  \n**Old rashes popped back up**\\- 1 month- I think due to skin being thinner old rashes came back, treated easily with athletes foot cream  \n**Scrapes and cuts**\\- Im clumsy and trip while running- keep wet with neosporin as long as possible, do not let scab  \n**Sunburns/tans**\\- moisturize, try to avoid  \n**Sore lower back**\\- around 2 months, ibuprofen (From running, I was doing 10ks, that was too much, 5ks are fine)  \n**Headaches**\\- 3 months, minor and infrequent, treated with Ibuprofen  \n**Dry eyes**\\- 3 months, Systane balance was good for mild dryness, the summer sun pushed me to systane gel drops, but only needed eye drops a handful of times  \n**Dry nose**\\- 3 months- alternates from being dry and congested to runny. Ayr and drinking water help a little, but not annoying enough to do much else  \n**Flushing**\\- 3 months on, skin just turns red easily, cheeks are always pink. Didnt treat because I dont really mind it as much. My skin tone normally never flushes so its a fun change for me. Niacinamide is touted as a solution though  \n**Loose hair**\\- 3 months on, not sure if due to accutane or just not showering every other day. Still have plenty of hair  \n**Drowsiness after taking pills**\\- \\~4 months, noticed Id be drowsy after taking pills, usually just napped for like 20 minutes  \n\n\n**Fun bonus side effect!** I found my cheekbones became much more pronounced on accutane, possibly due to no longer having as much underlying inflammation. Now my entire face shape has changed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n**General tips:**\n\n1. Drink more water/ fluids in general\n2. YES you HAVE TO take it with 20 g of fat (Peanut butter was my go to on toast)\n   1. Also, peanuts, macadamia nuts, avocado, french fries, ice cream lmao\n3. NO you CANNOT wax/get a tattoo/suntan/dermaroll/ break or stress your skin in any way, I dont care how low your daily dose is or how mild the side effects\n4. STOP all other products with actives- antibiotics, topicals etc.\n5. Dont use oil based moisturizers of your face, your body is fine\n6. You can drink, but dont black out or do it every day\n7. Ibuprofen is your friend, not aspirin\n8. If you get constant headaches, call your derm immediately\n9. Keep injuries like scrapes or cuts moist with neosporin while they heal- it does take longer than usual, but they scar easier too\n\nSo, as you can see, month 3 was a fun month for me side effect wise, but I pushed through, because thats when my skin was getting REALLY clear and the scars were nearly gone. I did have one or two very small bumps that never fully surfaced up to month 4, month 5 was clear. I ended up above the 120 mg/kg because there was a few months between my initial appointment with a weigh in and when I started the drug, so Id already lost weight between then.  \n\n\n***Do I recommend Accutane?*****Yes**, but with caveats- in my time on this sub, Ive seen people complaining of severe side effects and lasting damage that may be from accutane (a lot of stunted growth) and the common denominator was that they were boys whod taken accutane as teenagers (AS YOUNG AS 14 WTF) and while my acne was worse as a teenager and could have benefitted from accutane then, Im glad I took it after puberty and urge teenagers on this sub exploring accutane to consider the same.  \nIn my imgur album I included some pictures of me as a teen/preteen and my entire face was a zit. I would get headaxches from the pressure and the pain, and nobody in my family believed how much I was suffering. So I understand, a lot of people here will understand. We just dont know exactly what accutane is doing in the body in every tissue at every age.  \nSevere acne sucks, I really do know. But the cost credible severe side effect Ive seen with accutane is stunting growth in pubescent boys.  \nSo i recommend it to people post puberty who have tried several other options."""

Anyways, after several weeks of my first ever grippy sock vacay as well as therapy and meds, I am glad to say I\'m doing much better now. But that\'s not the focus of this post. \n\nIn Feb2020, the day before Valentines actually, I got up out of my living room chair headed towards the kitchen and next thing I know I\'m in the ER again in a lot of pain. I had apparently passed out shortly after I stood up and since I was moving when I did go out, I ended rolling and basically slung my legs into the wall. Where my house was built in 1951, it has 2-3"" thick plaster walls over top of a metal lathe so yeah, the wall didn\'t give at all. I ended up staying in the hospital for several months because I had a tiny cut underneath one of my toes that went unnoticed because I had broken both ankles, several long bones in both feet, and my lower right leg. They had originally sent me home after splinting what felt like my entire lower body but ended up coming back 2 days later because that little cut had gotten infected with staph aeurus, and so as a preview of what secrets the rest of 2020 held that developed into septicemia and was admitted. Long story short, I\'m writing this post in 2022 so I made it. When my doctors got around to trying to figure out why I had passed out originally and was still doing so, the blame was placed on my blood work from the hospital that showed a pretty bad case of anemia. I was also told that they wished that my anemia would have been caught sooner because I probably wouldn\'t have had that first fall, and yes, all that was necessary for me to get to the point. \n\nLast week I happened to go online to pull up the results from a set of labs I had just had done, and since I was bored I kept scrolling back through all my lab results and I came upon the huge set of labs they ordered at the ER the night I was sent to the BH floor. There was just about everything there you could imagine from aspirin and Tylenol levels to a drug screen and blood alcohol content. When I opened up the CBC or complete blood count, I couldn\'t believe what I was seeing. When they ran that test, my total red and white cell counts were well below the bottom of the normal range, my hemoglobin was an 8.9 (at 8.0 they usually begin giving you blood) and my hematocrit was 32.4. Basically, my blood was as watered down as a free drink on an airplane. What I am thinking happened was that because I was there for SI that time and not something to do with an injury or other sudden medical event, no one bothered to even give that CBC a second look, mention it to me or my wife, or even send a note to my primary care doc. There has been a lot of headway made towards seeing mental health as a normal part of medicine but there is a LOOOOONG way to go. Am I wrong for thinking that since I was there for BH that they just overlooked the anemia or even worse, dismissed it? Thanks'"

I have read a few of the posts here and it seems we all have  similar issues. Below are my issues:\n\nBut first a little background, before I started questioning life and everything around me last year sometime, I was one of those people that just got on with things and just did it. \n\nFast forward a year and a half, I have been stuck I feel. I don't seem to have any desire. Its a bit of puzzle, I want to improve but I don't care enough to. I know I need to improve but I don't realise that actively in my head. \n\nI am always full of excuses and I realise this. I feel shitty and no matter what I achieve it never feels enough. I recently graduated, I have a really caring and loving girlfriend who loves me more than the world. But I don't appreciate her enough in my eyes. \n\nI have a drug problem, nicotine and codeine. Can't seem to think straight without these fuckers in my system. I don't have the balls/will to believe that my life will be better if I stop this. I understand that I should and should cherish life but nothing seems worth it.\n\nI have a part time job and I am doing a professional qualification. Covid fucked my professional plans and I fell into depression and slowly working myself out of it.\n\nThings have been working out for me recently but, like I mentioned earlier, I am not able to appreciate it. I don't really care about money, even though I feel I  should. \n\nI am not able to keep a singular focus and thinking pattern. I want to make a change in a way that's meaningful to the world but I feel bogged down on life.\n\nJust having read what I wrote back, I see the issue of not being able to stay focused and care about things that I feel I should. Tbh, most people tell me I'm doing fine but I know I'm not. I could be better and I want to be. But I want to escape this demon in my head that holds me back.\n\nYes, what does this have to do with ADHD? I'm not sure man, but I feel like it does. My thinking behind it, if I am able to focus and do the things I need to then I won't be feeling so shit. Oh also, I failed two classes of my master's and I am currently on a break from it.\n\nWhat do you guys think, do I genuinely have a issue or am I making shit up. I would be grateful for your opinions. Please hit me with reality and don't hold back. I genuinely need it.\n\nI deeply appreciate your kind time."""

When i do its like once every few years and is a minor cold that goes away in a few days and sometimes i have to have Nyquil/Dayquil but nothing ever serious. This should set the stage why i put off going to the dr with the below timeline.\n\n10-28:\n\nScratchy Throat, Sneezing/Blowing Nose, Sinus Pressure that gradually started to go away\n\n11-10:\n\nTook long road trip vacation where i was exposed to cold temperatures for an extended period of time where the above symptoms started to show signs again\n\n11-16:\n\nHad a scheduled medical procedure (Upper and lower GI) to see if anything could be found for longstanding throat clearing and regular diarrhea. I asked ahead of time if there was any issue being a bit under the weather and they said as long as im not consistently coughing id be fine. Nothing was found in the procedure.\n\n11-25:\n\nSymptoms grew to the point beyond what it had previously. The sinus pressure was really getting to me, there was a considerable amount of dark brown phlegm in my throat i kept hacking up, i was sneezing, coughing and blowing my nose constantly.\n\nFirst visit to Urgent Care: Antibiotics prescribed (Cefdinir) for 10 days since I'm allergic to penicillin and they thought this would be a good alternative.\n\n12-2:\n\nSinus pressure was gone and most of the nose blowing had subsided however a new symptom had presented itself. My throat become quite painful when swallowing and clearing my throat which was regular with the brown phlegm i had to spit out (carried a spit bucket with me around the house since there was so much.) Even though it was only 7 days into my 10 of taking the antibiotics i felt the need to address this new symptom as id say the pain was about a 6.5/10.\n\nSecond Visit to Urgent Care: Nystatin prescribed. They believed that the antibiotics had killed off my good bacteria and caused Thrush to develop in the back of my throat which is why there was pain. They advised to continue to finish the antibiotics and take the Nystatin for 5 days.\n\n12-7:\n\nAt this time the hurting throat, brown phlegm and coughing still continued so I decided to go back to urgent care to determine the next steps.\n\nThird Visit to Urgent Care: Benzonatate (for coughing) and Methylprednisolone (Steroid) was prescribed in hopes to take down this beast of a sickness. Also there were tests done for Covid, RSV, Strep, Flue 1 and 2 which all came back negative.\n\n12-14:\n\nThroughout this whole experience I've woken up during the nights to cough because phlegm was filling my throat so had to spit it out and I've taken Dayquil/Nyquil/Ibuprofen/Mucinex DM/ chloraseptic lozenges (Per suggestions of the Dr.) to cut down the Phlegm and pain. Urgent care advised at this point there was nothing they could do and i should proceed with working with my primary Dr. for further diagnosis.\n\nPrimary Dr. Visit: I give him all the details above and he says theres not really anything else that can be done or prescribed and I just have to wait it out by drinking a bunch of water and gargling salt water. Throughout this experience I have been drinking tons of water, gargling saltwater sometimes, drinking tea (promotes good bacteria) lots of soup and trying to eat relatively healthy as i regularly do. I wasn't satisfied with his answer, but figured I'd see where it goes.\n\n12-22:\n\nCome to today. Regular routine has been wake up in the middle of the night to cough up brown phlegm and go back to bed (anywhere from 12-3am), wake up at 7am to get up and cough up the brown phlegm i can get out, take my regular vitamins and allergy pill (D/K/Multi B and Zyrtec), take the ibuprofen to stop the growing pain in the throat, take Dayquil to help break up the rest of the brown phlegm i couldn't get out.\n\nThroughout the day there will be minor coughs due to phlegm and ill have to spit the brown phlegm out but pain is relatively non-existent until about 4-5 pm when the phlegm and pain starts creeping up so i take another dose of ibuprofen and Dayquil. Then comes nighttime and to help get me to sleep the best i can sometimes ils have some sleepy time tea, Nyquil and an ibuprofen which helps, but i still find myself waking up during the night to hack up some brown phlegm.\n\nI am at my wits end living off Dayquil/Nyquil/Ibuprofen/chloraseptic lozenges to ease the phlegm and pain. I've come here today in hopes that someone can recommend medication, dietary restrictions or food that will help or anything to rid me of whatever abomination that is in my body. I thank you ahead of time for any advice and or giving me a glimmer of hope to cure me of this beast. As a last effort I have been considering using Sudafed but not sure if that would get me anywhere or not as I'm about to go to purchase my 3rd bottles of Nyquil/Dayquil. Please Help!\n\n12-28 (10pm)\n\nI started feeling a bit hot so I took my temp and it was a bit over 99 degrees.  I thought potentially this could have been since i had a big hoodie on so took that off and seemed to cool off.  That night I couldnt sleep and for a few hours i felt incredibly cold with weakness and aches.  My wife seemed to have been coughing throughout the night too so i feared it was Covid.  The wife and i took a rapid test in the morning and both showed positive for Covid.  I had worse symptoms though with the added fever she didnt but its probably due to my prolonged weakened immune system.  Stayed in bed roughly 2 days strait and gradually seemed to be able to sleep better with each day passing.\n\n1-3\n\nNot sure what is Covid symptoms or what i had before but i still have the phlegm, cough, blowing nose and random throat hurting.  Its only hurts on one side towards the back of my throat.  When i first got this it was on the left side but now its on the right side.\n\nMedical History Tidbits that may or may not have any relevance:\n\n* Took Pfizer first and second shots for covid but no boosters\n* Within the last 5 years ive had nasal cavities drilled, tonsils removed, and a nissenfundoplication to try and address throat clearing.  \n* Within the last 5 years i was diagnosed with chronic sinusitis\n* This year i had shingles """

I went to a dermatologist and he said that I have eczema and kept prescribing me with different products but my skin got worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5582i440kbs41.jpg?width=732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=400d792aac9e4cff47190d3ad2ecfe55f89764ac\n\nI've never experience eczema as a child and none of our family members had eczema too. most of us have oily skin with pimples. so I was wondering that if eczema could develop in people with oily skin or did the products I used for treating acne broke my skin layer and developed into eczema. I am super confused and I just don't want to go to any dermatologist again because of my bad experience with them. Any help or tips will be appreciated.\n\nThank you."""

I feel like a death sentence has been given to me . It all started 2 months ago when i found that my neck gland lymph nodes were swollen and painless and it had a hard feeling. Mann i went to the emergency hospital because I was literally constantly having panic attacks every fucking second because I kept thinking it was cancer(lymphoma) . The doctor gave me antibiotics and he also gave me a paper to go see my doctor that checks up on me every 4 months or so if the lymph node has no improvement or hasn\'t changed at all i would have to go see him, he also told me that he had one behind his neck that had to get surgically removed. I went to go see him on the third day on antibiotics because my mom saw that i was crying constantly and stressed that i didn\'t even come outside no more like i used to do. The antibiotics were prescribed for 2 weeks(Clindamycin) btw. My main doctor checked my neck lymph nodes again to check and he said that both were swollen on each side on the same spot but i wasn\'t really concerned for the the second one because I was constantly poking and touching my neck feeling for lymph nodes (i would constantly feel for them every 15 minutes) all though they were the same size this one was just not SWOLLEN. I was more concerned about the big one that\'s about 1 inch wide(left to right) and half a inch going up and down, and it was like fat and had a lump feeling to it . Sorry I\'m not really good at math. he sent me to go get blood tests and he sent me home. I was still depressed man after all that i still wasn\'t relived. My mom deieced to take me to California to take a break from school and this bad health anxiety. Fast forward 1 week into Cali i took a shower at the Venice beach public showers or whatever there called and boom a big ass folliculitis rash the next morning it was itchy and burned like heck( mind you I\'ve had folliculitis like 6 months ago so it looked pretty much like a regular folliculitis rash (it\'s on my chest ). Fast forward 1 more week     the folliculitis rash was already healing up and i was still taking the antibiotics but sometimes i would only have time to drink 2 pills a day not 3 like prescribed because I was  traveling places. Fast forward when i got back to home i had like 6 pills extra but i would take them still as usually even though I was supposed to been done with them . I took most of  my antibiotics with vitamin C because I was this one post about it killing tumors or some shit like that. Once I stopped taking the pills BOOM INTENSE ITCHING ON EVERY SQUARE INCH OF MY BODY. I got so fucking scared panic attacks were worse i would cry allot i would get very depressed. My mom tried every allergic reaction cream, every damn cream you could think of for my skin and nothing helped. My appointment with my main doctor is not untill the 1st of October to get my blood analysis. It\'s been 2 weeks since i got my blood drawn wouldn\'t have he received the analysis yet?? Me and my mom got our blood draw the same day and she got her back already a week ago. I want the damn results already i know they received it already i just want damn answers. Ok but this is the worst part yet hear me out, In school I\'m always slouched and i always had pad posture most of my high school year. I got ""rounded shoulders"" according to the  internet which is true i cant keep my back and shoulder straight. anyways i got this really bad upper back and chest pain and it would hurt to breathe when i breathed deeply (l was experiencing all this on the left side  body) i searched up the symptoms of what was happening and it was all saying ""heart attack"" ""heart attack\'"" like jeez I know I\'m not about to have a heart attack. The pain on the back and chest would go away though when i would do some type of stretch or when I would pivot my body a different direction, it would also take the breathing issue away too. the pain goes away when I\'m standing up but it happened when I\'m sitting for 30 minutes or more. I think it\'s something that has to do with a muscle strain right since it goes away when i move ? The same day i went to go play basket ball with my friends and since i was so out of shape for not exercising for about 3 weeks my heart was beating at 1,000 miles per hour like fuck and it was beating so hard too   but then the sharp pain again when I would breath in deeply but it stopped once my heart beat settled. I also some what was out of breath and i might of been wheezing too i don\'t know tho.I think that\'s normal right?after not exercising for about 3 weeks?. I did play bball for over 2 hours so i think i just over exercised or just did too much of what my body can handle after being out of shape.  Or am I wrong ?. My mom said it could be asthma again because I did have asthma when i was in like second grade .she said that she\'s going to make me a appointment for the asthma place.  I forgot to mention that yesterday in the night i found this lotion that said itching and pian relief cream with lidocaine and it said it numbs away the itch and pain even though I didn\'t have pain, but let me tell you I slept for the first time in forever good without  the itching bothering me like i had 0 itchy. I put some on for school today in the morning and 0 itchy as well the whole day literally till the night. That cream is literally magic. After i showered though i decided not to put on any of that magic  cream on and i find myself not really itching that much as before like last time it\'s like a 3/10 itching now when before it was a 10/10. I still find my self wheezing a little with no pain though when I breathe deeply but i think it\'s because of the 2 hour exercising i did and because of me being out shape for almost 3 weeks. Well that\'s it guys any suggestions on why my skin was itchy so bad but a little better now and the breathing problem i think it might be asthma like my mom mentioned. thanks for reading my post please comment on what you think, is it just everything is happening at once so it makes my life worse or is it what i always thought it was (C) please'"

Almost like if it was put on incorrectly or how my temporary crowns felt. There was also some pain on my premolars and they felt like they are being pushed forward, which is unusual because almost all of my teeth have a bit of spacing in between, especially towards the front of my mouth.\n\nI did not sleep at all that night, I was taking Acetaminophen and Diphenhydramine hoping I would crash but I did not.\n\nNext morning we went to Rite Aid again. This time I got the 4x Orajel Blue Gel, some Naproxen, and Doxylamine Succinate so I could finally sleep. I finally felt some relief and slept for a few hours.\n\nThat night came and went.

I did a course of bactrim, which did not help. \n\nI went back to the derm and he did a culture of one of the pustules, nothing grew. He told me he thought it was Henoch-Schnlein purpura and put me on a 3 week course of prednisone.

So I\'ve been dealing with depression for a little over 6 years at this point. I\'ve had numerous people tell me that I can\'t be depressed since I\'m able to get out of bed everyday, and that I\'m faking it. I basically have no friends - just acquaintances and two cats. The reason for not having any friends is that everyone wants me to support them, but when I need it, nobody\'s here for me - or they tell me I\'m faking it for attention or just flat out faking it since ""other people have it worse than I do and I just need to suck it up"" - or they act like it\'s a mental health competition. My depression is getting better - I just need medicine for it, and every time I ask for help, I either don\'t get the meds I need or I get put on something else that doesn\'t work and messes me up mentally and physically - such as depakote. I was on Zoloft then prozac many years ago, but the person who prescribed it to me didn\'t believe that either medicine could possibly be helpful since I had a bad experience with lexparo which this same person prescribed to me - and she has a mentality that if one thing didn\'t work, then all things similar to it automatically won\'t work, so it\'s not even worth trying. She wanted to put me on lithium after my neurologist complained that my depakote dose was too high for it not even helping, so I was eager to get off it (it was also supposed to help for migraines, which was an epic fail too). I haven\'t seen her since January of this year since she wanted to put me on lithium - not that I didn\'t want to go on it, but more or less I\'m just depressed at this point and don\'t see the need to be on such a heavy duty medicine when prozac and Zoloft worked well in the past. I also stopped seeing her since over time, she became incredibly childish when she realized that I\'m able to make my own decisions without her consent, never saw me on time, thought it was fine to schedule someone else during my appointment time, and never listened to me, so it just wasn\'t worth the hassle to keep spending time seeing her since I wasn\'t getting better under her care. \n\nI\'d like to get back on an antidepressant such as prozac or Zoloft, or maybe even symbyax.

I started my second course of Accutane end of January. Id taken it in 2016 and it was a miracle drug. My skin cleared up and stayed clear for three years. Unfortunately, a brief dip into lithium in late 2019 had made my skin awful again, so I decided to go back on Accutane before I scarred too much. \n\nMy normal meds are Effexor, Abilify and trazodone for sleep, plus Klonopin as needed for anxiety. The Klonopin makes me really stupid so I basically never take it. On Thursday, March 5, I went to get an IUD put in. I couldnt remember which OTC pain meds I was allowed to take - Effexor and Accutane both mess with your liver which makes some pain meds really dangerous - so I took half a Klonopin instead, figuring it would at least mellow me out through the procedure. That was about 4pm. At 7:30, I went to a dance class. Thats the last thing I remember until Saturday morning, when I woke up in a psych ward with deep gouges on both of my wrists. \n\nI had taken Klonopin before, many times - never had anything like this happen. I can only assume it was the combination of the benzodiazepine with the Accutane. (FWIW, both my regular shrink and the doctors at the ward agree.) Its absolutely horrifying to wake up in a psych ward with no memory of what happened, and then to find out you tried to kill yourself? Blackout-me really meant it, too; she cut down to tendon on one side and even wrote a suicide note. Seeing the note afterwards was surreal - the strangest part was that it wasnt anything like my normal handwriting. \n\nAll of these medications were prescribed to me by doctors I trust. Ive always been very careful with my meds and potential interactions. I even googled the combination beforehand and didnt find any known interactions. And still, Accutane almost killed me. \n\nBelieve it or not, I dont regret taking it. Im so much happier now that my skin isnt in pain all the time, now that I dont have to slather on makeup to go out. But I do want to stress that Accutane can be extremely dangerous or even deadly ESPECIALLY if you have a history of mental health issues. However careful youre being, double it. Please.

This was addressed during my 4th year of dental school and I have been clean and sober now for 2 years.\n\nI made it through dental school relatively unscathed, but when I'm only seeing 2 patients a day and you can get bailed out at any time it's pretty easy to not get too overwhelmed.\n\nI graduated in 2014 from dental school and immediately started work at a community clinic. Being a new dentist was stressful enough, but attempting to help people who cannot take care of themselves physically/mentally/financially/etc was incredibly anxiety inducing for me. I decided that I needed to make a change.\n\nI started a new associateship this December working in a private practice. Prior to December, this was a solo practice for 30 years with plenty of extremely loyal patients. Now that the owner doc wants to only work part time, I'm there to pick up the slack. I was hopeful that my anxiety would diminish with the new setting/clientele, but as of writing this I realize I may be very wrong. The pressure of delivering dental care and meeting the expectations of these patients loyal to the owner doc has me on edge every time I step into an operatory/hygiene room. My anxiety is just as bad if not worse than before.\n\nI question whether I was truly passionate about dentistry or whether I was seeking external validation or compensating for what I felt were shortcomings in my social/family/personal life. None of my colleagues/friends never knew the true realities of any of my anxieties/addictions. I have always been able to hide these things fairly well and kept them internalized for longer than I should have.\n\nMy gut feeling is that even with the medications/counseling/support groups/practice I am not mentally/emotionally healthy enough to be a dentist and that I should pursue an alternative dental career (possibly in teaching pre-clinic at a dental school or something along those lines). The other side of me is telling me that I'm being weak/fearful and I need to just stick it out and eventually these feelings with diminish if not disappear. I'm skeptical though as I have talked with several dentists who are also in recovery that still question their career choice after 10-15 years of practice.\n\nAny insight/advice would be appreciated. Not looking for a definitive answer necessarily, but I do feel like I need a reality check. Thanks."""

I have done drugs as if they are Minecraft potions for about 3 years now. Rather than it being a problem, I used to space it out in periods of a few weeks where i try new medications the same way psychiatrists do. Ive also done a good number narcotics. Every drug i do is for the sake of either experimentation or self medication.\n     Im now at a point in my life where im high pretty much 24/7. Im diagnosed bipolar and plan on getting a med card within the month. I stopped doing everything that isnt weed after i got addicted to generic alprazolam. Also, after doing a little too much warfarin a few times im at a point where pills are officially out of my life, which my girlfriend praises me for. Same goes for acid.\n     I still live at home and am entering the second half of my last year of high school. My family life never has been the greatest. I grew up in a household of an angry roided out biker father and a hippie heroin addicted mom who died when i was 8. At 6, my grandmother took me in and adopted me at 9. My grandma is a great woman but she never fails to mentally abuse me. My uncle played the role of my father passed the age of 6 because my dad was put in prison for dragging a police officer on a main road with his lifted ford pickup. Said uncle is also good at being mentally abusive, but he usually just intimidates me by saying hell come beat me to death.\n     Ive attempted suicide one time while i was in the hospital for a brain injury caused by a skateboarding accident. I tried to hang myself with a bed sheet but a nurse tackled me off the stool. Its as if i saw a doorway to another universe in the loop of that noose. Either that or the low blood pressure from the all anticoagulants i put in my system was giving me hallucinations.\n     My new girlfriend is great but she gets really confusing sometimes given the fact i have no idea how to speak to other human beings. Im supposed to move across the country with her in 6 months because she is going to college in California and i plan on going to an art college and making music out there. I want to marry her one day because she really gives me everything i need both emotionally and physically and helps me stay on an even keel most of the time.\n\ntldr: 18M, shitty life, self medicates with narcotics and medication, new girlfriend he wants to marry\n\n\nMain Story:\n     Ive been seeing the same therapist for a few years now, and he tells me i have adhd, depression, and some sort of ptsd. My mood swings were getting worse so i saw a psychiatrist who told me im actually bipolar and put me on some new anticonvulsants i havent tried before.\n     One day i blew my fuse at my grandma and started smashing my head in the wall and threatening suicide, because my uncle pulled another pull up to my house and fight me rn situation all while on the phone with my therapist. He breaks my fire by telling me my grandma is going to send me to the psych ward. So i ran away. i had my friend pick me up and bring me to my girlfriends house.\n     After a huge unnecessary incident, turns out my therapist lied and was actually the one who wanted to send me away. So i stopped going to therapy altogether and now am just going to act like im normal and nothing ever happened.\n\nAnyway i just needed to vent. Im gonna go smoke a bowl now :).'"

My cystic acne is under control, as it was before. But my face is still covered in these tiny closed comedones, a full 8 months after stopping all antidepressants. Its ruined the texture of my skin. I do think the acne is better and easier to cover up compared to when I was taking the meds, but its still there.\n\nMy dermatologist claims none of these meds cause acne, but I think they were almost certainly the cause.

I tried stretching my neck but that just made it hurt more. \n\n\\- Headache worsens, advil/ibuprofen no help. It felt like someone was squeezing my head and pressing ballpoint pens into the base of my head where the spinal cord inserts. Saw flashing lights while working at my computer. \n\n\\- Hot flashes and night sweats. \n\n**Friday 01/29/2021:**\n\n\\- Saw my doctor. I didn't tell him specifically about the neck stiffness because I thought it was just from sleeping on it wrong, and he already knows about the myoclonus. I was just really worried I had COVID. \n\n\\- Had another negative COVID test at the doctor, also negative for influenza A and B. My vitals were OK. Breathing was a little fast they said and I was very clammy. They gave me 8mg Zofran for the Nausea which helped instantly. \n\n\\- neck still stiff, fever reduced. Headache very prevalent still. I went home and iced and stretch my neck. That really helped my headache, which made me believe something else was going on.\n\n\\- night sweats but overall a better sleep than previous. \n\n**Saturday 01/30/2021 (today):**\n\n\\- threw up a little bit this morning, headache very bad in the morning, neck less stiff and much less painful to move around. I used a heat pack and that helped even more.  \n\n\\- took Zofran and again it helped. Fever seems to be gone. only minor body chills in the morning. body aches much less. lower intensity myoclonus. as of posting this I am overall feeling much better. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nfirst of all, thanks for reading :) feeling so much better today and I am thankful I do not have COVID. I came across meningitis when reading about the neck and headache thing with flu symptoms on google, and read it can be very dangerous. \n\nI am now concerned that I could have had meningitis, and just didn't catch it. I feel i am on the tail end of whatever this is (my doctor didnt know but thinks it is viral), however I am still worried if it is meningitis that there can be longer term effects. \n\nThe reason I think it might not be meningitis, and just maybe I slept on my neck wrong is that while i did stretch one time which made it worse, stretching another time (later in the week), made it better which wouldnt happen with meningitis i dont think. The pain did come back swiftly, but that can be casued by a lot of things. Also no one i know has had meningitis.\n\nThe reason i think it could be meningitis is because the neck seemed to be linked to that terrible headache. I have never had headache pain like that. it surrounded my entire head from my eyebrows, forehead, back of head, and hurt incredibly bad near the back of the head where the neck comes it. It SUCKED! some moments I could not stand up and rarely sleep.  \n\nAt the moment, I was so concered with not having COVID that I bushed these symptoms off to flu or caused by myoclonus or sleeping wrong. \n\nI have been rapidly getting better since yesterday afternoon, so I do not think there is a lot of cause for alarm, but I am more worried about any long term effects that meningitis could cause. \n\nAre there any thoughts? Regardless, I am going to call my doctor on monday and let him know about this but I wanted to put it out here first. \n\nThanks."""

Does anyone have a similar experience/know if it's possible for me to pinpoint with testing?

amitriptyline,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/kd89u1/amitriptyline_and_seroquel/,b'Amitriptyline and seroquel',,"b'Can you take these two together? I was prescribed seroquel a couple years ago and was taking 25mg/day max till I got really sick (presumably covid) in March. Long story short I had symptoms for months and stopped telling my doctors about the bipolar2 diagnosis bc 1. they literally weren\'t believing me and told me it was all in my head and refused to help and 2. I figured that with the intense brain fog I was experiencing, I had no actual depressive or manic episodes so it didn\'t really matter anymore. Needless to say, I decided that I need help for more immediate issues as I was experiencing 24/7 debilitating dizziness (along with other symptoms) since March and that I would not bring this up to doctors so they wouldn\'t gaslight me or write me off. Nine months later I FINALLY was able to see a neurologist after begging my gp for months for help with it, and the neuro diagnosed me with vestibular migraines and prescribed 10mg of amitriptyline a day. I didn\'t want to take this bc lexapro had sent me into a manic state years ago, but I also wasn\'t ready to explain to my doctors why (honestly I don\'t trust them yet and I\'m just not ready to deal with it and ""come out"" about it). Anyways, I tried an anticonvulsant that didn\'t really help with the dizziness, so I reluctantly agreed to the amitriptyline. I\'m taking a smaller dose till I work up to 10mg. I know these doses are tiny, but I am sensitive to meds and want to be prepared if a manic episode comes my way. Does anyone take or has anyone taken any combo of these two medications? I could take the ami every night but a couple a week (neuro was originally debating between every night and every other night for me), so I could switch a night here and there to seroquel (I have been prescribed this on an as needed basis in the past). I do want to stay on the ami for now at least to see if it works. Any thoughts??'"
NSAID constipation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/nqubix/my_sciatica_journey_long_read/,b'My Sciatica Journey (Long Read)',,"b'Hey everyone! \n\nYesterday, I posted a picture of myself before I went through my microdiscectomy. The location of my surgery was at the L5-S1 level. I had been experiencing severe sciatica for about a year at that point. My back pain was minimal but since Im a college student, the sciatica was horribly impacting my ability to function on a day-to-day basis. During presentations in class, I would look squirmish trying to relieve the intense pain going down my left leg. Walking to class was also difficult and during social events, I would always be questioned by my friends as to why I would go lie down in bed. Eventually, I got coined the nickname old man for having back issues at the age of 20 (I thought this was actually a humorous). Because I know many individuals are going through intense sciatic pain and are also considering surgery, Im going to give you guys the outline of what I experienced over the past year. Warning for all of you that hate long reads, this is a long read! I have divided my journey up into months/significant events so skip ahead if youd like. If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask! Hopefully, this is informative for everyone and can give yall some insight! \n\nEarly May 2020 \n\nI used to be a pretty active guy. I would go on runs on trails about 3-4 times a week and run about 3 miles during these runs. After a run one day, I noted something weird in my left lower leg that I would describe as dull, achy pain. I didnt think too much of it since I just figured my muscles were acting up. Finished the day walking my 3 miles instead of running them. \n\nMid May 2020 \n\nThis is when I knew something was definitely wrong. I woke up one day from bed and couldnt bend over. My back pain ranged from a 9/10 to a 10/10. The pain would be relieved by lying down or when I would sit in a chair. \n\nLate May 2020 \n\nAt this point, I figured I had pulled a tendon or a muscle in my back. The pain in my back was slowly starting to get better but I noticed that when I tried to walk, there was more pain down my left leg. This was accompanied by feeling numbness and tingling down in my feet. I decided to wait it off and see if it would resolve on its own. \n\nLate June 2020 \n\nBy the end of June 2020, my severe back pain had almost completely gone away. I experienced some back pain when I would try to bend over but nothing severe like I had previously experienced. On the other hand, my leg pain seemed to be getting worse. I decided to take a visit to my primary care physician to see what was up. After doing research online, I began to suspect that what I was experiencing was far worse than a simple muscle strain or pull. My dad had a herniated disc in his 50 and suffered from sciatica. My mom also had back pain and sciatica but to a lesser degree. It became clearer that this might be what I was suffering from. \n\nFirst Doctors Visit Late June 2020 \n\nSince my leg pain was still severe and walking/running was almost unbearable, I went into the doctors office to try and get a proper diagnosis. After explaining to my doctor I believed that I had sciatica and had a family history of having bad backs/sciatica, I was ordered to get X-Rays and was prescribed a steroid pack along with a NSAID. \n\nMy X-Rays came back completely normal, revealing that my problem did not originate from issues with my bones. While the NSAID I was prescribed did nothing to help my leg pain, I found that the steroid pack helped a lot. Even though it made me feel lethargic throughout the day, it definitely helped to get rid of the shooting pains going down my leg. Despite the relief, I could feel something was still wrong with the leg/back. \n\nBesides taking medications to help alleviate my symptoms, I decided that sitting in bed all day waiting for my pain to go away was not going to help especially if my injury was what I suspected- a herniated disc pressing against a nerve. I took the initiative to walk as much as possible throughout the day since I wasnt doing much apart form a small-time commitment internship. \n\nLate June- Late July 2020 \n\nAt first, I approached exercise a bit too rough. I tried to run through the pain but realized that really aggravated my symptoms. I quickly switched to walking. Progress was very slow. Each week I would walk more and more until I was walking about 4-5 miles every day. The more I walked, the longer it took for sciatica symptoms to really make walking unbearable. \n\nWhen I was getting in form and feeling better, I decided to do a mix of both running and walking. At first, I would walk 2 miles, then run 1, then Id return back to walking. Three very interesting things I noticed during this phase. First, walking downhill was a lot more painful than walking uphill, likely because when youre walking downhill, there is more force pushing on the disc toward the nerve. Second, I realized that I could reset my pain by either crouching or finding a place to sit down for a few minutes. After I would crouch or sit, my pain would go away. Throughout my walks, I would do this when the pain got really bad. My final observation was that especially after doing long distances, the next day my leg would feel a lot worse. However, after a few days, I would let my leg calm down and the next time I would go to exercise, I would be able to run and walk further without severe symptoms. \n\nAt this point, I was still hopeful that I would be able to make a full recovery without doing more intensive or intrusive treatments. Exercising was an excellent way to manage my pain in a natural way. \n\nEarly August \n\nWith my exercise process providing my relief, I was excited to continue it and get as close to normal as possible. I was near normal by the end of July or at least I thought I was until I had to move out of the room I was living in and move into my new apartment. Unfortunately, this was huge mistake. I moved out by myself and was bent over most of the time picking up things off the floor and carrying heavier objects like my mini fridge. \n\nAn hour or two after moving into my new apartment, my back and leg pain went back to very severe. I was a bit pissed at myself because I knew that all of the progress I had made went out of the window. \n\nMid-August 2020 \n\nAfter making the poor decision of moving into my apartment by myself, I was in absolute agony and pain for the entire month of August. My pain was at its worst. Because orientation was starting up at my school for first year students and I was orientation leader, I was unable to try to exercise my pain back to a stable level. When I did walk to places around campus, my leg pain was so severe I felt nauseous at times.\n\nOne afternoon, after walking around campus for a bit, my pain was the worst it had ever been. It got so bad, I was certain that I wasnt going to be able to fall asleep. I made the decision to go to the ER that night to see if they could provide any relief. \n\nER Visit Late August \n\nYou would think that going to the emergency room because youre in so much pain would be the logical move. Apart from the huge amounts of pain in my leg, I was starting to feel shooting pain in my left groin area and it felt strange to pee. I was afraid I was experiencing Cauda Equina. Unfortunately, the doctors did absolutely nothing during my stay there to improve my state of pain. I was ordered a CT-scan by the doctor and also checked for abscesses in the area since I did have a previous history of suffering from abscesses in the upper buttock area. \n\nAfter waiting on my CT-scan results, the nurse came back and told me I had what appeared to be a bulging disc at L5-S1. Otherwise, all of my other blood work came back normal. What angered me the most was that when the doctor came to talk to me, the doctor said all my tests came completely normal. I asked about the CT-scan which the nurse had explained to me had found a bulging disc. The doctor said he had not seen that on my report which left me so confused. The doctor explained that there was nothing wrong with me and that I would be going back home. When the nurse came back to my room I told her what the doctor had said. Her reply was absolutely unacceptable- Sometimes he just doesnt listen. \n\nThe nurse was a bit more helpful in telling my next steps. While I was hoping to get an emergency MRI, she explained to me that I would need to go get one after my visit at the ER elsewhere. I imagine that the CT-scan cant pinpoint causes like an MRI scan does, which is why it was labeled as a bulging disc instead of a herniated one. Remember that the two are very different. Regardless, I left the ER feeling very disappointed and with no pain relief whatsoever. I wasnt even given steroids to help reduce nerve inflammation. \n\nSeptember 2020 \n\nWith school starting back up in a fall semester, I was extremely busy with my academics which caused me delay my appointment with a well-reviewed orthopedic doctor in my area by a few weeks. In addition to this, because classes dont require a lot of standing up, I wasnt miserable all of the time since I could sit down in chairs. (Big thing I realized here too- different chairs will cause more pain than others!).\nI finally went in to my appointment with an orthopedic doctor and explained to him my story of back issues/leg problems. At first, we did what my primary care doctor did. I was prescribed a steroid pack along with NSAIDs and muscle relaxers. My steroid pack worked once again but left me feeling extremely tired throughout the days. NSAIDs once again provided no relief whatsoever. Muscle relaxers also gave me no relief from sciatica but helped me fall asleep on days when the pain was pretty bad. They also left me feeling yucky the day after. \n\nMy second visit with this new doctor was when I was actually able to get a diagnosis. Straight leg test was positive on the left leg during his examination in both visits. He ordered an MRI and recommended I start PT to see if conservative treatment would help. \n\nPT and MRI Early October 2020 \n\nA lot of people had said PT had given them mixed results. The success stories I read gave me hope that I would be feeling a lot better after PT. Unfortunately, I can say for sure that PT did little to nothing to help improve my pain. I ended up going three times in November and had no success after a variety of different exercises (Cobra pose seemed to trigger my symptoms more). \n\nWhen my MRI report came back I felt validated when I looked at the images. There was a clear herniation at the L5-S1 level that looked pretty gnarly. After dealing with the issue for a few months, I was finally able to say that my issues stemmed from a disc herniation that was compressing the existing left nerve root at the L5-S1 level. All of my other discs looked good. \n\nDoctor Follow-Up Late October 2020 \n\nEven the doctor was a bit surprised that I was experiencing a disc herniation at such an early age. I was glad that at this point, we had come to the cause of all of my leg issues. After I explained to him that PT had essentially failed, our next step was to go to epidural injections. \n\nFirst Injection Late November 2020 \n\nMy first injection went excellent. After seeing this new doctor, I was a bit worried since he had pretty lousy reviews online. Despite this, after going through with the first one, I experienced solid relief from my sciatic pain. This was however did not last long. After one month, my leg issues came back; certainly not as strong as they were in August, but still strong enough to where I wasnt comfortable standing up or walking for long distances. \n\nSecond Injection Early March 2021 /Follow-up After \n\nI had to wait three months before I could get another injection after my first. I went in with the same doctor excited that I would get similar relief like the first one gave me. The second did not go as planned. Instead of providing relief, I experienced steroid flush for about two days and that was it. I was extremely disappointed.\nIn my follow-up I told my doctor that the injection provided little to no relief. At this point, given that my symptoms had gone on for nearly a year, he sent me to a surgeon to discuss possible options with him. \n\nSurgeon Consultation May 2021 \n\nAfter explaining to my third new doctor that my symptoms had not improved, he told me that surgery would be the next option. With this he explained that at my young age, more surgeries were likely in the future. I decided to go through with it, because in all honesty, Id rather have ten more years of a pain-free lifestyle and have an awesome time during my 20s rather than be the guy who always has to stay in bed or sit down because of a disc herniation. \n\nSurgery June 1st 2021 \n\nWith that, that brings us to yesterday when my surgery was scheduled! Everything was painless and the care I received was exceptional. One minute I was feeling calm from sedation medicine and the next minute I woke up in recovery! I have not felt any leg pain so far. The only worry I have currently is that I cannot support my entire weight on my tippy toes on my left foot, but I suspect that this will slowly improve as time passes! Currently prescribed with narcotics, nausea medicine, anti-constipation medicine, and Narcan in case I overdose lol. Back feels pretty achy and sore but completely expected! \n\nEnding Note \n\nHopefully, this was informative even if it was a bit long. Let me know if anyone has any questions about any point in my journey and Ill be happy to answer them. A lot of people fear surgery but going in, I felt is was my best option given my experiences. Ill conclude by saying that many people do warn others against it and sure, it isnt for everyone, but it is certainly better than living a miserable lifestyle where you cant do much! For all sciatica sufferers out there, it can be mentally draining to have to deal it every day but remember to stay persistent and hopeful that things will get better. Keeping your mental health in a good state is just crucial in my opinion to have a faster and more effective recovery!\n\n\nThank you all for letting me share my story!'"

This has happened to me before where I get into these episodes where I cant sleep well and I have trouble falling back to sleep after I keep waking up. I also think I have undiagnosed sleep apnea so idk if this may be contributing to me waking up every time. Anyway, after a few days of this happening, I woke up with a really bad headache and I didnt think much of it, I thought it was simply because I wasnt sleeping well and that it would go away in a while. So I didnt treat it at all and then I realized it was a migraine and i let four more days go by and now Im on day five of this migraine and I never treated it because I thought it would go away on its own and that it was due to my sleep issues. Ive had migraines before and theyve usually gone away on their own so I thought this would be another one of those but i cant remember if theyve lasted this long. I hate taking medication as Im prone to side effects so I resorted to waiting it out. The whole time that Ive had this migraine I have been having insomnia and I still have not been able to sleep throughout the whole night without waking up and having trouble falling back asleep. Paired with what i think is sleep apnea, I feel like this may be the reason my migraine has not improved since my sleep has not improved either.  Has anyone else had migraines triggered by poor sleep/insomnia and did they resolve on their own and if so in how long? Did your migraine resolve once your insomnia/sleep issues did? I spoke to a doctor already and I found it weird that she prescribed me celebrex. On top of that I clearly told her I already had stomach issues and she swore up and down that this wasnt a nsaid and that it wouldnt irritate my stomach. Has anyone else been prescribed celebrex for a migraine? Or has anyone with stomach issues like gastritis for that matter been prescribed celebrex and what was your experience? She also prescribed me imitrex since I practically begged for a triptan instead of celebrex, but she said it was preferable that i take celebrex since triptans are more next level. Has anyone taken it and what was your experience with it? Im very prone to side effects so Im scared to even take any of these, especially celebrex considering I have gastritis. Also has anyone ridden out a migraine without meds without complications and how long did it take for it to go away?'"

There is, however, a component that is even more important to change though it can be a little harder; **The Doctor**.  I recently posted \n\n>If there are 2 people (other than yourself) in the world you should be honest with it's your Doctor and your SO, IN THAT ORDER.\n\nI truly believe that you have to be absolutely honest with your doctor.  First and foremost, this is for your own safety, some of the drugs that doctors give us can have incredibly dangerous side effects either on their own when mixed with certain other drugs or even when mixed with certain habits or behaviors.  As an extreme example; If you are an IV drug user and you don't disclose this to your doctor and he decides that you need to be on warfarin, which is an incredibly powerful blood thinner, your doctor will warn you about the fact that even small cuts will bleed a lot more than normal.  Well, if you use IV drugs that needle may well cause you to bleed a lot, like enough to threaten your life.  That all comes before we even think about how opiates (most common iv drugs) might interact with that drug. Now that doesn't say anything about why changing your doctor is sometimes important but keep reading, I'm getting there.\n\nIf the relationship with your doctor is such that you don't feel like you can trust him/her well enough to disclose some of your darkest secrets then you should make an effort to find someone you can trust.  **You and your Doctor MUST have mutual trust with each other.**  Now the sorts of issues that we address in this sub, ADHD, are the hardest to be trusted with.  Psychological issues are always hard in part because in most cultures they carry a very significant stigma, in part because they are hard if not impossible to understand if you aren't experiencing them yourself.  These issues can also be incredibly hard to put into words to express.  All of this leads to a lot of anxiety which makes being honest harder.  Your doctor should always be working for your best interest, after all doing so is in his best interest.  You and your insurance are directly paying the doctor to work in your best interest.  **If you don't feel like your doc is doing the things you need or if you don't feel like you can trust your doctor, then look for another.**\n\n*****\n\n**TLDR; Your doctor should work *WITH* you and if he isn't or you can't trust him then fire him and find someone new.**"""

I'm a Current student at a prestigious/competitive university and I have pretty gnarly depression and ADHD. I'm prescribed Adderall and quite frankly it's the only thing driving me, but regardless my hard work has paid off so far - got As and A minuses on the first round of exams.\n\nMy schedule is backloaded as fuck, so at the end of every month I have a ton of exams. So recently I've been taking Adderall more often than usual, and thus I've been looking for sleep aids - gabapentinoids, hydroxyzine, ambien and klonopin.\n\nI learned the hard way that benzos actually suck ass for me. Took 4 mg klonopin on Friday night and I've felt zombified since. It's long ass half life/comedown has me feeling even more anhedonic, empty and apathetic than normal. I imagine this is like a diet version of an antipsychotic.\n\nwelp, Woke up today feeling empty and depressed, with a fuck ton of studying I had to do. Popped like 70 mg of adderall over the course of the day and it barely helped as the klonopin crash was keeping me low.\n\nTonight was possibly the worst I've ever felt. Dealing with klonopin rebound depression AND an Adderall crash, I felt nearly catatonic. Could not focus on anything or think properly, just an overwhelming feeling of dread and emptiness. I have a ton of gabapentin so I said fuck it, I'm taking some and getting some real sleep.\n\nDrank about 4 tablespoons of olive oil and chugged whole milk. Popped 300 mg and washed it down with diet coke. I did this every half hour until I got to about 2100 mg.\n\nthe change in consciousness has been fucking incredible.

Seems like an appropriate song for my situation\n\nanyways. tl;dr is that gabapentin is an incredible and *powerful* psychotropic and blows benzos out of the fucking water, no question.

I thought it was a relatively non-addictive drug, I thought since everyone is depressed anyway, we should use it for the mild SSRI effect.\n\nI pulled up some articles that have made me second-guess myself. Tramadol carries a risk of serotonin syndrome (due to the mild SSRI effect). Another report says ""weak opioids ""like codeine, dihydrocodeine, and tramadol are no less risky than morphine. Then I read that tramadol can interact with warfarin to raise the INR. Yikes.\n\nSo I kept reading. Another article discusses **which opioids are best in the elderly and in CKD**.\n\n* Buprenorphine, transdermal fentanyl, and oral hydromorphone are the most tolerable\n* Hydrocodone, oxycodone and methadone are helpful but require careful monitoring\n* **Tramadol**, codeine, morphine, and meperidine should be **avoided in the elderly** due to the risk of accumulation and adverse events.\n\nAnother article said there was no superior analgesic efficacy with the administration of hydrocodone/acetaminophen when compared to patients receiving tramadol in the relief of cancer pain! Additionally, tramadol produced more side effects than hydrocodone. I try to avoid Norco in favor of Tramadol when I can. Is that wrong? I\'m starting to think so.\n\nOne article says Tramadol provides inadequate analgesia to hydrocodone-acetaminophen in ED patients with acute musculoskeletal pain.\n\nSo, medical experts of Reddit: what are your thoughts on Tramadol (ultram)?

Watery eyes, runny nose, itchy throat were my regular symptoms. I was allergy tested and I am allergic to pollens, weeds, plants, trees, all that stuff, plus a few more things. My symptoms were fairly manageable, with or without medication. \n\nHowever, for the past few years I havent really had those symptoms at all. Instead, Ive had a whole bunch of other weird health problems come up and my doctors are stumped so far. \n\nIve had a lot of digestive issues and recent tests showed elevated eosinophils in my colon, but no inflammation. One doctor mentioned eosinophilic colitis, but that isnt an official diagnosis, it was just a hmmmm maybe? I also have erosive gastritis, I have sometimes debilitating pain in my legs that can be constant whether Im standing or at rest, Im constantly fatigued but have trouble sleeping, and I am definitely more anxious than I used to be. \n\nThere might be no correlation, but I was wondering if anyone else had their seasonal allergy symptoms change or if anyone had issues with increased inflammation in their body because of any allergy, seasonal or otherwise. \n\nIve had blood tests and skin tests for food allergies and anything that came back was fairly minimal. A blood test showed a slight reaction to wheat, tomato, and peanuts, but the skin test didnt react at all to those. Dairy really makes me itchy and very congested but that has never come back as a positive allergen in a test. \n\nIve kind of been dealing with this for years, but it escalated over the last few months and I feel like Im at a breaking point with all of it. Since September 2020, Ive been medicated with antihistamines, prednisone, budesonide, gabapentin, lexapro, and probably more things I cant recall. I cant say anything has greatly helped and I fear some of the medications were totally unnecessary or made things worse. Ive really restricted my diet and have lost a lot of weight.

I have perennial allergies as well so this time of year is double trouble. I went to a couple of stores and got myself a Nettypot and Steam sinus reliever. I already own allergy pills (Xyzal), allergy eye drops, anti-histamine nose spray, and Breath Right strips. I currently take allergy shots but it has only been a year and  4 months on maintenance so they shouldn\'t have any effect yet, as my doctor said. I also am taking melatonin this time of year due to horrible sleep quality.\n\nThe point is, I did EVERYTHING yesterday. Yes, the steam, the netty, pills, spray... etc. And and AND: it DIDN\'T WORK???? Like I layed in my bed and after 5 minutes all the sinus and nose congestion was back!! I was expecting something like this but not this bad! I have already come to the realization that allergy pills and nose spray are placeboes haha ( I know your secrets Big Med :\\] ), but I really didn\'t think that none of this would work at all! At least the netty pot got a lot of clear snot out (I guess this means it\'s from the sinuses?), even if it was to return not 5 minutes later.\n\nAt 2 in the morning, nose stuffed to high heaven, I was led to this subreddit. I needed help. I found lots of advice that suggested **prevention** as the best method of relieving allergies, the logic being, that if there isn\'t any allergen, there isn\'t any reaction. Ok great, but the real problem is, how would I go about doing this? I\'ll pretty much do anything at this point, as this is my last line of hope.\n\nEverything would be dandy if I just had one or two allergies, as a certain Koopa once said, ""It would be so awesome, it would be so cool."" This is not the case for me. I am pretty much allergic to everything under the sun (and under the roof) at this point. Local trees, all grasses, pollen, horses, dust, mold, pretty much everything non-food except dogs and cats, which is a real fluke. If I had the list from the doctor it would be about 20/30 of the allergens they tested me for that came out positive.\n\nSo with all these allergies, how would I escape even some of them? What do I need to do to survive this Spring without developing sleep apnea? Are there any articles or videos I should look at, that will help me ward off allergens? Thanks for any help! Also thanks for coming to my Ted-Talk!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.: To clear up any confusion, I am a teenager, thus I face big problems mouthbreathing; underdeveloped chin, bad sleep quality, chronic drowsiness... If I could live without these problems that would be very nice. Also the reason I am not taking corticosteroids, sino anti-histamine nose spray, is because I don\'t want my growth to be stunted, which is a generally accepted side affect for those medications.\n\nP.S.S.: I think it\'s so funny that I spent more effort on this than any essay I ever wrote in English class.'"

I started to feel less weak but I developed shortness of breath where I could not take a satisfying deep breath. This lasted for months. I had 2 pulmonary function tests done and my breathing capability was normal.\n\nJun 2021 - I would still get a rapid heartbeat occasionally when going upstairs or running, etc. Also while still dealing with the problem of not being able to take a satisfying deep breath I started getting a dull pain under my sternum that would come and go and would feel better if I crossed my arms against my chest and applied a bit of pressure. This is what I would do to fall asleep when it was bothering me.\n\nEnd 2021 - Started taking omeprazole daily but it didn\'t seem to help at all. I started getting touch tenderness around my belly button. The stomach pain/discomfort has gotten worse. When moving around my stomach pain seems to get worse. Laying down made it more manageable.\n\nMar 2022 - Went to the ER one day when it was incredibly uncomfortable and the pain kept me in bed.

Around the beginning of April, I started getting very itchy on my upper legs. I didnt think much of it but it got worse and worse for a few days. I saw a doctor who said it was the TV due to being in the humidity and gave me 25mg Hydroxyzine 3x daily and 400mg Flucanozole once a week for two weeks. Seemed to get better. I arrived back in the US and the itching became uncontrollable. It began keeping me up at night, and the stress ended up triggering multiple HAE swells of my face (common for stress reactions for me). I ended up in the hospital, doctor checked Liver, Kidney and basic blood work, everything was normal with the exception of Low Phosphurus 2.1.  Doctor prescribed me 6 day taper of prednisone. Again it seemed to die down a little bit but as soon as the prednisone was done, itching is back even worse. There is NO rash at all. No red skin unless I scratch. \n\nWorth noting Im only itchy on my upper legs, and sometimes my genitals. Mostly front and back of legs. \n\nIm now in Mexico and its once again unbearable. Im taking 75mg of hydroxyzine every 4-6 hours and 20mg of prednisone 2x a day. Also told to take 100mg of flucanozole daily for two weeks. I get relief until I miss the dose of hydroxyzine or prednisone by a few hours. \n\nAny ideas would be really helpful. ER doctor told me that they dont think its systemic due to blood work, doesnt look like allergies due to no rash and normal cbc. Suggested it may be mental health related but Im very aware of my body and mentally Im doing OK. \n\nSorry for the long history.  I have all my labs if needed. Please let me know if there are any questions.'"

She did fine it removed rather easily. Then she stitched the hole closed. I did not do the bone graft cuz it was an option between bovine or cadaver and well that just made me want to hurl. \n\nWell, after the itching stopped from the numbing wore off and I could feel my face again lol I took advil cuz I was in a bit of pain. No biggie. 2 days later the removal site no longer hurts. However, the tooth directly in front of it now is constantly throbbing. The tooth removed was the far back on lower right molar. So now its nearly a week later and Im still taking advil every 4 hours cuz the tooth right in front of the pulled tooth throbs non stop. And advil just makes it bearable. I still have pain 24/7, I sometimes push on the tooth with my finger and pull at it it seems to relieve some pressure and pain but comes back within minutes. I also will bite down on a pen but then I end up with gag reflex hitting and want to hurl but for the short time Im able too it relieves pressure and pain even tho its a super sharp pain when biting down. \n\nAny idea of the issue? I will be calling my dentist office in the morning. I was just hoping it would have stopped by now but its just not.

And so had my mom and my grandmother. \nHowever I have stopped having headaches for a few months until about 4 or 5 days ago. It was primarily on my right side of my head right above my eyeball and under my eyebrow, and my right eyes vision was a little... not right. Not 100% blurry, but it wasnt too bad. I\'ve also for the past year and a half had been having problems seeing clearly just through my right side anyways on and off. Then it migrated up to the right side of my head and both areas were like a stabbing or hurtful poking feeling. Ended up going to sleep later that night. Woke up the next day and it was still there. Sometimes through my life this would happen, me having the headache for a few days. It\'s crazy. \n\nBut moving on...I went to bed with a headache, it was still there when I woke up, struggled all day again with no relief, went to bed, woke up again and this time it was on my left side, and the same areas, kinda behind my left eye but under my eyebrow with the same vision problem. Then it slowly migrates to the left side of my head, kind of to the top but not entirely. This pain was a little of the stabbing feeling,  except it more so just stayed there for a few minutes at a time went away for a few seconds and came back. Again went to bed with no relief.\n\n This time I woke up with no headache at all thank goodness. Though I am worried to get up out of bed and it come back lol. \n\nI would like to mention that I was diagnosed with Labrynthitis a few months ago and I\'m occasionally dizzy from it, positionally. And both of my ears have been hurting on and off ever other day or so for months, I\'ve been on amoxicillin 500mg for it in case it\'s an infection and i guess maybe it\'s done nothing since it still hurts every so often.My blood pressure has been great, I just can\'t take motrin because it makes it too high. My heart rate has been a smudge over 100 when moving around but I\'m pretty sure that\'s normal. I\'ve also devolved a rash all over my face before I went to bed the last night of the headache before I went to bed, not sure it\'s relevant but I\'ve just never had a rash like this before so I thought I\'d throw this in there. \n\nAnd twice within two weeks I think I\'ve stood up too fast from laying down because for a moment I\'d get up and the entire right side of my head and my ear would go muffled and scare the Dickens out of me.\nBut other than that, that\'s it. \n\n\nCan I get someone\'s opinion please?

penicillin itch,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/sgj65n/recurrent_uti_maybe_yeast_infection_also_gastro/,"b'Recurrent UTI, maybe yeast infection? also gastro issues'",,"b'Okay. For context, I am a cis female in her 20s. Be warned, this post is going to be long so apologies in advance. `Also, I am going to be linking images here, some of which a gross/graphic. Please click at your own discretion!`\n\nAround January 9th my vagina started hurting. I was concerned because it had no explanation. Im not sexually active, wasnt near my period, and hadnt had any trauma/penetration. I looked it up and concluded I either had a yeast infection or vaginitis. Even though it was my first infection and it was more so "" self-diagnosed"" I didnt want to go to doctor because of Omicron. So I bought Monistat 3 instead. It hurt like hell - especially on the first night - but the pain and symptoms subsided.\n\nHowever, I then quickly developed symptoms common in UTIs (burning during urination, frequent need/urge to urinate, sudden need/urge to urinate to point of urinary incontinence , little urine coming out, sometimes blood in urine that does come out, etc). To confirm that I had a UTI, I bought a CVS at home UTI strip test and as soon as I peed on it, it turned bright purple on the top pad, indicating the presence of leukocytes ([picture of UTI strip test 1](https://imgur.com/a/GdnIw41)).\n\nI went on [goodrx.com](https://goodrx.com), to get a prescription and told them my symptoms. My they asked me if I was feeling nauseous at all or had recently vomited. I told them yes to both. They asked me if I was experiencing any pain around the sides of my back. Again, I told them I was. They were alarmed and wouldn\'t give me a prescription because the were worried I had a kidney infection. She told me to go to an ER or urgent care immediately or as soon as possible (it was like 2am, my symptoms were keeping me awake)\n\nSo, a few hours later, on the 13th, I went to an (poorly reviewed, but mostly empty and not overrun with COVID) urgent care and told them my symptoms and about my positive strip test. I also told them that I had recently vomited, was experiencing nausea, and had lower back pain. They gave me a 100mg prescription for Macrobid and *then* took a urine sample. I was on the Macrobid for 5 days. Some of my symptoms alleviated (blood in urine & less serve burning) but I was still uncomfortable. I took another UTI strip test and I was positive for leukocytes again ([picture of UTI strip test 2](https://imgur.com/a/3DPJhPG)). Worried that the antibiotics hadn\'t worked, I took my temperate. My thermometer is not great, but it gives the temperature and a happy face :), medium face :/, or sad face :(. My temperature got a :/ and was (according to the cheap thermometer) 99.8 ([picture thermometer reading](https://imgur.com/a/ZO6dGIq)). While I assumed at the time that it was just anxiety, I was also feeling rather nauseous at this time and have some gastrointestinal issues.\n\nI went back to the same urgent care (only place with open appointments in my area) on the 19th. This time, they didnt automatically give me a prescription and took a urine sample *first*. I told them about my thermometer\'s reading (low-grade fever?) and they took my temperate, which was normal. They told me my sample had ""no leukocytes and no nitrates"". They said I should see a OBGYN or Urologist if my symptoms continued. Unsatisfied, I asked the urgent care to do a urine culture and they agreed. In the meantime they gave me a 3-day 200mg prescription of Phenazopyridine to ""improve symptoms"".\n\nHowever, when I got emailed the results for my urine culture a few days later, it said I had a ""beta demo streptococcus, group b"" colony of I believe 10,000-25,000 growing inside me. The urine culture recommended that I take ""Penicillin or Ampicillin"" to get rid of the colony. The urgent care however, didnt contact me or provide a new prescription for this drug.\n\nOn the 22nd, I went to a different urgent care. I told them my continued symptoms and showed them the lab results from the urine culture. They took a urine sample and said I definitely have a UTI (meaning the poorly review urgent care was wrong). They also said I had a lot of glucose in my urine (I think it was 250 mg dL?). They were concerned that I might have diabetes (I guess. I am 5 3 and about 100lbs) so they took a blood sample and it was normal (110 - also I wasn\'t fasting). This, to them, ruled out diabetes. From my understanding however, having glucose in your urine is still quite bad and indicative of the kidney being damaged or diseased ([renal glycosuria](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/renal-glycosuria/))? For context, as a baby, I was hospitalized for a week with a severe kidney infection and my kidney is scarred. Additionally, my mother (biological) has an auto-immune kidney disease. I unfortunately, didn\'t tell this to the people at urgent care, but I don\'t know if it would have been important.\n\nAnyways, they gave me a 7-day prescription for 300mg of Cefdinir. A few days later, I got my 2nd urine culture results back and they said I ""didnt have much growth"". They said this was likely due to the antibiotic I had already taken, but to keep taking the new antibiotic.\n\nI finished the prescription yesterday (29th) but while taking it, my initial symptom of vaginal pain/tenderness re-appeared. First, it was just during wiping but by the time I was almost out of the antibiotics, it kept me up a lot of the night and was hurting without being touched/wiped.  Furthermore, despite (or because of, in some cases) my drinking water and having the antibiotic, my urge to urinate was (and is) still more often than usual and my urine is (and was) cloudy and foul/sour smelling.\n\nThis morning (30th), I took my 1 remained CVS UTI strip test and it was positive for leukocytes (there was also slight dot of positivity for nitrates?) ([picture of UTI strip test 3](https://imgur.com/a/1ZHqoWs)). Upon looking to the reviews for this product however, I saw it does tend to have false positive results ([1](https://www.cvs.com/shop/cvs-health-urinary-tract-infection-test-strips-prodid-870916)). So, I went out to buy AZO UTI strip test, which has better rating. ([2](https://www.amazon.com/AZO-Infection-Accurate-Clinically-Self-Testing/dp/B00854L57U)). It was once again positive for leukocytes ([picture of UTI strip test 4](https://imgur.com/a/RAMUcvY)).\n\nAt the time I bought the AZO UTI Test Strips, I also bought *AZO Complete Feminine Balance daily probiotic* because of the vaginal pain/itching I have been experiencing. I know one on the side effects of antibiotics is yeast infections, so thats what I thought it was.\n\nNow, to get to the poop stuff, all the while (and prior to this all beginning) I have had minor gastrointestinal issues (mucus in stool, etc). During this time in late January, I also cycled through my period, so I initially blamed it on the period poops. But I finished my period a few days ago. Anyways, I went back to the bathroom and felt a need to go number 2 but nothing was coming out besides smelly, noisy farts and mucus/a clear goopy liquid). Then, a tiny piece of poop came out, and seemed to have two string-like things in it. One was darker and thicker, and the other was smaller and whiteish `WARNING: GRAPHIC!` ([poop with somethings possibly in it?](https://imgur.com/a/ZlVamWf)) `WARNING: GRAPHIC!`\n\nI found this alarming and look it up. I thought/hoped maybe it was a single fiber string (if anything) but then I saw according to some, ([sydneygutclinic.com](http://sydneygutclinic.com/)) recurrent yeast infections can be a symptom linked to parasites ([3](https://sydneygutclinic.com/the-main-symptoms-of-parasitic-infection/))? I don\'t really know, but now I am worried. As I was writing this, I had the urge to go the the bathroom *again* and while I didnt find anything stringy in my poop and was able to pass some stools, there were also lots of flecks of poop, as well as some possible mucus. Also, the poop/farts are sometimes very pungently smelling like baby poop `WARNING: GRAPHIC!` ([more poo](https://imgur.com/a/ApV1wws)) `WARNING: GRAPHIC!`\n\nI also read on a website ([healthline.com](http://healthline.com/)) that their can be an overgrowth of Candida bacteria in the intestines, as well as the vagina ([4](https://www.healthline.com/health/candida-in-stool)). Maybe it isnt a worm and the yeast infection spread from my vagina to my intestines? But those part of the body arent even connected. Im very confused.\n\n**I am going to establish care with a gynecologist and primary care professional** but I am a little freaked out, cause some sites ([lymedisease.org](http://lymedisease.org/)) say it might be Lyme disease ([5](https://www.lymedisease.org/parasites-viruses-yeast-fungal-infections/))? I obviously, will take everything I read on the internet (including here) with a grain of salt, but I am worried.\n\nI would really appreciate some advice. I don\'t have a OBGYN, Primary Care Provider, or a Urologist, so when I make an appointment/establish care, do I tell them it\'s urgent?  If so, how urgent?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\\*throughout this ordeal, I have tested* ***negative*** *for COVID-19 multiple times*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------\n\nEdit/Update: I went to the bathroom yet again, and in addition to there being another thicker, string, substance - that substance seemed to kinda move? The string or whatever it is, moved from the top of the poop to the bottom. I wasn\'t able to get a gif/video of it moving and perhaps it was the air/farts coming out of me? But I wasn\'t sitting on the toilet when I took the picture? Regardless, here is the picture of how it looked before it started moving `WARNING: GRAPHIC!` ([poop with spiral coming out of it](https://imgur.com/a/djxk4uM)) `WARNING: GRAPHIC!`\n\nIn addition to that, I also saw what looked like could have been blood?

NSAID vomit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/l6hnts/impossible_burger_allergy_sharing_experience/,b'Impossible Burger Allergy - Sharing Experience',,"b'I\'m sharing this, in case anyone else experiences it and asks themselves, ""Is this real? Has this happened to other people?"" FYI, this story involves gross bodily functions.   \n\n\nMy husband and I have been trying to eat more vegetarian, more healthy, and more planet-friendly. We\'ve been eating Beyond Burgers for a couple years now, and we both like \'em.  This year, we started trying the Impossible Burger and burger meat to make things like meatballs. \n\nFirst Instance:\n\nFelt nauseous, had minor regurgitation, slept for three hours in the afternoon, b/c I felt terrible.\n\nSecond Instance:\n\nScarfed an impossible burger on a salad between meetings. One and a half hours later, had a bodily fire sale. Everything must go, out both ends. And it was awful. I told my husband several times throughout the two-hour ordeal that I was going to die. He was smart and kind and helpful. ""You\'ve just gotta get whatever it is out of you, you\'ll drink water, and sleep for a day. It\'s gonna be all right."" As he\'s washing my body and the shower. (I know. I got a good one.) (And I know, gross. Sorry. It\'s just what happened.)\n\nIn-Between\n\nI had chalked that last experience up to me not washing the lettuce well enough on the salad. I absolutely did not put the two instances together in my head. They were months apart.\n\nLast Night:\n\nHubby made pasta, impossible burger balls with cheese and sauce. Salad on the side. One and a half hours later, same as last time, but a little worse. After two and a half hours of vomiting and diarrhea, I had to finally lay down and literally will myself to stop. I was empty, there was no point in either. It took three hours of sleep and concentration to get it to stop. (I didn\'t want to go to ER for an IV, b/c expense and COVID.)\n\nOverall:\n\nI realized by my Googling that this particular subject of alternate meats is politicized. I think that\'s ridiculous. There\'s not enough beef to go around for all of us forever, and there\'s money for everyone. I am absolutely one hundred percent a beef lover. Steak is my favorite food. There is no agenda in this post, except to share with other people who are as scared as I was last night. I didn\'t even figure out the cause til about 5 AM this morning.  \n\nI also think it\'s worthy to note that both times, I had salad. It might have no bearing, but I dunno. Maybe the mix of both set something off? Possible red herring. Also, worthy of note, this just happened to me. I don\'t know anyone else yet personally to whom this happened. I have found other posts in Reddit and online about other people having an intolerance for the product. (though I haven\'t yet found one that matches my violent illness experience)\n\nAs an aside: I have asthma and allergies and have developed an anaphylactic response to NSAIDs as I\'ve gotten older. Yay aging.  Good luck. I hope this serves to help someone feel like they\'re not alone.'"

gabapentin,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n70k01/experiences_with_gabapentin_as_antidepressant/,b'Experiences with Gabapentin as Antidepressant & Social Anxiety Medication',,"b'Hey, so I had some gabapentin from some time ago prescribed by my doc for my depression, social anxiety and psychosomatic pain (or whatever it is). \n\nWhy Gabapentin? Because I have been completely therapy resistant to all the SSRIs, SNRIs and one MAOI as well as a tricyclic. Im also in behavioral therapy right now, just to let you know.\n\nI only took 300mg every morning before breakfast for the last 7 days and well, it was more effective than any other med I tried. My depression was 90% vanished. My cognition (focus, memory, logical thinking) started being functional again. I didnt feel dumbed out and cognitively retarded anymore. I even felt smart. I especially noticed  my better cognition in social events and conversations a lot but also at reading, following movies and just remembering general knowledge. My head didnt feel empty and dysfunctional anymore. My brain was working again.\n\nIt did more for my depression than my social anxiety but hell sure the cognitive improvements helped with socializing too. I still felt some kind of nervous before having to socialize but when I was in the social situation I was much more talkative, funny and social. I was enjoying my ability to think clearer, finally being cognitively more functional and definitely feeling some reduced social anxiety.\n\nI know that my dose of 300mg is very low, so I think that a higher dose might not only help my depression and negative thinking but maybe also increase the social anxiety reducing effects.\n\nWhat I would like to know of you guys:\n\n1. If you have some experience with using Gabapentin for depression and/or social anxiety, what fose have you been on and what effects or changes did you notice regarding depression, negative thinking, mood, energy/motivation and especially social anxiety and sociability/talkativeness/extroversion.\n\n2. Ive only been taking the gabapentin daily for 6 days now as I heard a lot about its withdrawals being hellish and horrible af. Whats your opinion on this or do you eve have any experiences with withdrawals? How bad are they, how long do they last after how much time on daily gabapentin?\n\n3. Is it possible to use gabapentin occasionally on a only if needed basis? Or is it needed for depression and anxiety disorders to take it daily for better effects and symptom reduction?Like 3-4 days a week only to hinder tolerance and withdrawal. Thats what I would do it like if possible as I have experience with GABA withdrawals and they are not nice.\n\nGabapentin is the only thing that worked for me but it seems unrealistic to have and use it as a daily medication for my depression and social anxiety, I guess. What do you think? What are your suggestions?'"
acetaminophen problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/w6eqm6/advice_for_prolonged_pain_management/,b'Advice for Prolonged Pain Management',,"b'Hey, everyone. \nIm posting here as a last resort because experiencing sciatica is new for me and I havent had these problems in the past. I understand that theres no quick fix for things like this, but after seeking help on my own for a while, I figured Id ask to see if anyone could offer any insight to whether or not I should seek another professional opinion. \n\nMy pain began about three months ago; late April. It started out feeling like a pinched nerve or a pulled muscle, which Im no stranger to. Ive had pulled muscles in the past and theyve always resolved themselves within a couple weeks, but I realized this is much different. \nMy hips are misaligned and I have a bulging area in what my doctor refers to as the sacrum/sacroiliac joint which from what I understand is connected to the pelvic bone. Hes convinced that hard bulge being very obviously out of place is predominantly a muscular issue. Hes an OMT and definitely seems to know what hes talking about when it comes to his understanding of how those areas function, but he doesnt have any sense of urgency about my sacroiliac joint being misaligned. Hes already realigned my hips twicethe second time being yesterday. The first time it was done, I experienced relief for a solid two weeks and thought I was on the upswing, but was harshly disappointed when my pain reappeared a couple weeks ago. I dont want this to continue as a cycle of getting alignments/OMT therapy only for the issue to persist. I do a series of exercises that Im sure everyone here is familiar with; a huge packet of movements that do relieve pain sometimes, but other times do absolutely nothing for me. \n\nSleeping is an absolute nightmare, and I currently take ibuprofen and acetaminophen to combat the pain. I work a retail job that is thankfully very understanding of my limitations, but being in constant pain has been killing my spirit and I dont know what else to do. Its terrible when pain isnt treated with urgency, and I have a wealth of empathy for everyone here. \nShould I seek a second opinion? I really didnt want to turn to a chiropractor, but Ill admit the idea is looking better by the day. The doctors flatly refuse to do any sort of imaging, too, which is very frustrating'"

antimicrobial problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/vh3v6j/multiple_root_canals_failed/,b'multiple root canals failed',,"b""I'm wondering if I have some underlying problem that causes my root canals to fail.\n\nI had a root canal done by a dentist on tooth #21 1.5 years ago and since that time that tooth was giving me pain.  I went to multiple doctors to get opinions, they took X-rays and CBCT scan but could not find anything.  At some point the pain lessened but after 2-3 months returned even worse.  I went to an endodontist who suggested to redo the root canal.  They also took another CBCT scan.  The root canal was redone but the pain didn't stop, it was getting a bit better and then worse but no overall progress.  After 2-3 months i decided to have this tooth pulled.  Oral surgeon who pulled the tooth said I had an infection under the tooth, which was a cause of this pain.  The tooth apparently was not cracked.  I thought that redoing root canal would take care of the infection, but according to them, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nAnyway, long story short, in 3-4 months after this I ended up needing another root canal on tooth #20.  This time I went to another endodontist to do it.  Unfortunately, after 2-3 days that tooth started hurting again.  The pain got worse.  They agreed to undo the root canal and put antimicrobial medication into the canal to see if this will help.  That procedure did not seem to help.  The other thing they did was to give me antibiotics.  I tried several ones, Amoxicillin, Augmentin and Erithromycin which didn't do anything.  The one that did help was Clindamycin, as I felt much better after couple of days.  The pain never really went away completely, but it was minimal for couple of months however then it returned.  The nature of the pain was very similar to what i had for #21, but not as strong though.  The endodontist said there is nothing more can be done about it and suggested for me to get extraction and implant.  This time i decided not to wait a year like i did for #21 and got tooth #20 extracted several days ago.  They also let me take the tooth home, i examined it but didn't find any cracks.\n\nMy question is that what could be going on.  Do i have some persistent infection that causes all my root canals to fail?  I m afraid of the same thing repeating if i need another root canal.  I'm planning to get an implant (or 2) to replace the missing teeth, but also concerned if an implant can fail too for the same reason (infection).  According to the doctor, it is possible the infection was anaerobic, since treating with Clindamycin worked for a while.  However since this also ultimately didn't fix the problem, something else is required.  The root canals were done and redone by different endodontists so it's hard to believe that both did a bad job.  This is a mystery for me.  I asked oral surgeon if they can take a bacterial culture to determine precisely what antibiotic i need, so far they said they normally don't do this kind of thing, but perhaps i need to ask again.\n\nAlso, I had several root canals done in the past, about 20 years ago, and there was no such problem.  Any ideas?"""

I've been to doctors back and forth and it's always been brushed off as anxiety. One time when I was 18 I thought I was having a heart attack so I went to hospital and they did ecg scans and said it's just anxiety I'm okay. Anyway a couple weeks ago I got sick and my husband brought me some high electrolyte drinks. After having just one my heart palpitations that usually cause me to be unable to sleep had gone away. I could actually relax for the first time in a long time. I've been drinking them daily ever since and my heart palpitations are gone and when I do experience the odd one it's much less severe. On average I'd suffer with heart palpitations every day several times a day and it would last for hours. Also in the past I'd drink a good deal of water to try help my heart palpitations Incase they were from dehydration and it would actually make it worse! Any ideas what this could be? My guess is electrolyte deficiency of some kind"""

It was almost unbearable. But I never saw any redness extend outside of the adhesive at the time, so I just thought it was itchy.

They decided to get me ones that were for sensitive skin, just in case. I believe I finally got those this last Monday and replaced it with that, then.\n\nIt has not gotten any better. If anything, my skin is more itchy and the adhesive is even worse now as it wont even stay sticking on my skin for long.

codeine swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/868njb/sinus_surgery_experiencekeeping_myself_sane/,b'Sinus surgery experienceKeeping myself sane',,"b""So Im day 3 post-sinus surgery. Got a septoplasty, balloon sinoplasty, turbinate coblation, and some sinus ethmoidectomy (not sure of the name on this one.) \n\nIm writing down my experiences for the benefit of anyone else and to remember it all by. \n\nWhat made me get the surgery? \n\nMy experiences were strange, and likely either due to my lack of insight into my own body or just a really slow, steady worsening of symptoms, it took me forever to figure out I had allergies. The very first symptom I noticed as a young child was post-nasal drip. I asked my mother if it was normal to be constantly swallowing mucous. Of course, honey, she replied, as she also had a deviated septum and horrific sinuses from years of smoking. It was shocking to me to learn, years later, that not everyone has a choking fit on their own secretions several times a month. \n\nCut to me, age 24ish. I start noticing a strange gagging sensation after eating. I suspected some form of strange growth, or throat cancer (my grandfather had it) but also reassured myself that if it were a structural problem it wouldnt be so closely tied to eating. This symptom continued and grew worse and worse over the years. It was especially bad when I had a cold, or ate something spicy that would trigger my nose running. I would end up dry heaving because I gagged so hard. Around this time, as it worsened, I had gotten two cats and moved out of the city into a very wooded environment. It never occurred to me that this might be allergies, though, because I never thought of myself as an allergic person. \n\nEventually I began noticing my appetite was completely vanishing.  This was not an EDI wanted to eat, but the gagging made food unenjoyable. On top of it all, my food began to taste bland. I went through a phase of preferring intensely spicy food and very salty food before that, too, began to taste somewhat bland, like someone had thrown a filter over my tastebuds. I got dangerously underweight because I never wanted food, to the point where my underweight status triggered heart palpitations. \n\nThis was a wake up call. I needed to eat more, but the gagging was a real problem. I needed to figure out what was causing it. I got an endoscopy before being told it wasnt reflux. They ruled out gallbladder issues and a swallowing problem. Finally, I saw an ENT and an allergist. \n\nI had swollen sinuses and a deviated septum. On top of that, I was allergic to cats, birch trees, dust mites and dogs. \n\nNow things were starting to make sense. I started on zyrtec every dayand it did help. I gained ten pounds back.  But the gagging was still annoying, and food still tasted bland. I tried Montelukast, which made my sinuses bleed, and a spray for rhinitis, which made them bleed more, so I stopped taking the medicines. Eventually it got to the point where I was constantly swallowing blood from my sinuses. It was winter, so I thought this was likely normal, but I did mention it to my ENT. When he heard that, he suggested a CT scan. \n\nMy ENT called me the day of the scan. My CT showed some intense swelling, and after going through a few appointments and one second opinion, I decided to go through with the surgery. It may seem like Im downplaying some of these symptoms, but if there was even a remote chance that the surgery was going to stop the gagging during meals, I was all for it. Further opened airways would be a bonus. But the gagging was seriously affecting my QOL. \n\n\tSo, that was why I got the surgery. The surgery so far has beenan experience. \n\nDay 1: Im a nervous wreck going in, and my procedure was at 7:30 AM. They gave me a scopolamine patch to prevent any post op nausea (Ive never had post op nausea before, but I guess they wanted to be safe) and the actual procedure itself was fairly easysleep, wake up after a dream about zebras, and Im in recovery. My doctor doesnt use packing. This was interestingI had a drip pad, but I could breath through my nose. Air felt nice, though my right sinus, likely the side of the corrected deviation, wasnt quite as open as the left. I did notice that any post-nasal secretions dripped right down rather than getting stucka good sign, I hope, and one that I hope means that once all this swelling is gone the gagging will be a thing of the past. I talked to the medical student, who told me that ultimately I will feel even better than I do now, but that the next few days thing will get much worse. Ominous. I took one dose of Tylenol with codeine for pain, and then headed home. I was given antibiotics, Tylenol with codeine, Zofran, and some Neilmed. All the medicines were in liquid or dissolvable form since I cant swallow pills with my gagging issues.\n\nThat brings me to the rest of the day. The most annoying symptom day 1 was the dripping. I wore my drip pad over my nostrils all day, and for good reason, because the blood dripped out at the rate of about one pad every two hours. By the evening, unfortunately, the swelling began. I took off the scopolamine patch at this point, too, as I suspect it was giving me annoying side effects (pain urinating). Also, withdrawal from scopolamine patches is supposed to be hellish and I didn't want to risk it. \n\nI slept in a recliner, and got very little sleep. I would wake up whenever I felt any dripping, not to mention that my two cats enjoyed running around all night. And by the morning, the swelling was completeI was completely and utterly blocked, only able to breath through my mouth. The one silver lining was that there was no pain. I havent needed any painkillers since the first half hour after waking up from the surgery.\n\nDay 2: Total congestion in the morning. Eating and drinking was hellish with such a blocked nose. I had no sense of taste, but I managed a boost protein drink through a straw. By the afternoon, though, the act of putting my lips around a straw would cause the gagging sensation again. Seems I wont be free of it until all of this swelling is down. I was supposed to see my doctor for my post op on day 3, but I rescheduled to Day 2 because of the weather. \n\nThe cleanout was painful. The pain is like getting your legs waxed, but on the inside of your nosesuperficial pain to be sure, but pain.  Luckily, my ENT did it really fast. The doc also spritzed some decongestant in there and sent me home with a prescription for prednisone to help with the swelling. For about three hours I was breathing manageably through my nose, although not well. I started sinus rinses, but all that really means with such blockage is shooting up some saline and watching it drip back out. \n\nDinner was horrible. Unable to breath my nose, I had to chew with my mouth open, and I would get out of breath trying to eat pasta and not choke at the same time. Afterward I felt horrifically shitty and had another gagging session, after which I felt better. All of this was coupled with some intense anxiety brought on by the very claustrophobic feeling of intense sinus pressure and not being able to breathe through my nose. I took a Xanax to help me sleep.\n\nDay 3: Woke up 100% blocked, but I did sleep better than the night before despite waking myself up with snoring at times. I took the prednisone first thing in the morning. My sense of taste came back just enough to let me know how godawful disgusting that stuff tastes. I also discovered my antibiotics taste like strawberry and were actually rather tasty. I ate a protein drink for breakfast and a bit of bread at lunch. My appetite was non-existent. \n\nThe prednisone didnt do much. I still felt very blocked most the day. I kept trying to use sinuses rinses, but they didnt do much either. By dinner, I was anxious and miserable again, and kind of off-feeling. The gagging had returned too. I felt hot, incredibly anxious, and after I ate (or in this case, drank a protein drink) I was nauseous as hell. I took a Zofran and an hour later when that did nothing, a Xanax. Im not sure why I felt so horribly shitty in the evening, but I suspect the prednisone. I likely wont take it tomorrow. \n\nDay 4: Lots of draining while I slept. I woke up very bloody and uncomfortable, but improved from there after a hot shower. I took a zyrtec in the morning instead of the prednisone. Lots of improvement today--still very blocked and horribly congested, and eating is still tough, but the gagging sensation wasn't as intense today. I had more of an appetite and didn't need xanax around dinner time. Right now it feels like a horribly bad cold, albeit one with intermittent pain if I touch my nose wrong. I also still haven't quite mastered the sinus rinse technique. My right sinus still feels 100% blocked but my left is showing hopeful signs of allowing air through soon. \n\nDay 5: Day 5I decided to sleep flatter the night before, since I have a very painful muscle cramp in my neck from sleeping in recliners/combinations of pillows. Its isolated to one spot and Im too much of a wimp to massage it out. I woke up very congested, but there was far less bleeding and drainage. I felt very blocked until I did a sinus rinsethe rinse still isnt getting through one nostril and out the other the way I think its supposed to, but it did unblock me for a few hours. My right sinus got some air, but there was some burning pain with it, so I think it still needs some time to recover.  I also think Neilmed is putting a weird taste in my mouth/sinuses. That or theres some congealing gunk. Just four days until my next cleanout\n\nI felt well enough in the afternoon to eat a chocolate egg along with my boost protein drink. Getting close to Easter, after all! In less fun news, I do think the pressure of the swelling is affecting my vision a tiny smidgenin white rooms I see a lot more floaters and random visual noise. I had a lot of that before the surgery too, though. \n\nThe evening has been hell. The weird taste is unpleasant, and I made the mistake of eating a hefty few slices of pizza for dinner that I dont think my stomach could handle well. Ive got some GI issues too, maybe due to the antibiotics. The slight nausea catapulted me into a really intense panic attack, and not even my usual dose of Xanax has alleviated it. I hope tomorrow is better. \n\nDay 6: A better day. I'm still waking up with bloody crusties, but not as bad. My sinuses are sometimes blocked, but also sometimes open, though they never seem to both be open at the same time. I'm still getting weird tastes and drainage (The drainage is what causes the gagging sensation, and I hate it), and when one sinus is open I'm getting some pain in it--similar to the pain when you get water up your nose. All normal stuff, I imagine. I'm fairly certain there are some large icky boogers up there that I can't get rid of, and rinsing doesn't dislodge. Just 3 days until next cleanout... \n\nAlso, my sense of taste has definitely changed. I'm eating easy food to baby my stomach while I'm on antibiotics for the last few days, and chicken flavored ramen is GOOD. I liked it before, but now it's richer, if that makes sense? When this is all over I'm gonna have to re-try a lot of foods. I'm also craving the spicy food I used to like, but I know better than to try for that right now. I'm a bit excited though--I'm getting the sense that smells and tastes have bouquets to them that I was missing before. Maybe I'll even try and enjoy wine one day, which always just tasted like gasoline to me before. Of course, I'm sure I have several more days (weeks?) of recovery ahead of me before I'm 100%. \n\nDay 7: Close to Day 6. Slight improvements in the airway being open, though I can still there's swelling and general unpleasantness stuck up there. As the air way opens further, though, the draining is getting intense. A ton of stuff is dripping down, and I was incredibly nauseous in the evening to the point where I just went to bed early. Hopefully the draining will ease up over the next few days, or after the cleanout. I just want to be normal...\n\nDay 8: Fucking awful day. The nausea from last night lasted most of the day. I tried to get to work today, but felt so miserable that I left after two hours.  All I was able to stomach was white bread. The drainage is causing some bad gagging and nausea, I think. I took a zyrtec around noon to dry to dry up the drainage, and just laid down for hours. Oddly enough, by dinnertime the nausea started to fade and I was able to eat toast and some bacon. \n\nDay 9: 100% Better nausea wise. No idea what yesterday was about--was I swallowing some infected or nasty drainage? Did I pick up a stomach bug that caused just nausea and not any diarrhea or vomiting? It was bizarre. But today I feel mostly better. I'm still slightly congested, but its only slightly worse than it was before surgery. I have minor pinching pain in my nostrils, likely where the sutures are. But it finally feels like I'm on the mend. \n\nNow, I don't feel BETTER than I did before surgery, but I can assume that if I feel mostly like I did before surgery on day 9, then full recovery will take me into the world of healthy sinuses, right? I'll keep you all posted. And tomorrow, finally, is my cleanout! \n\nDay 10: Cleanout! It was first thing in the morning, and it helped immensely. My left sinus was totally 100% open most of the day, though it didn't feel as open in the evening/nighttime--but I can breathe through it no problem. The right side is still a bit swollen--the doc mentioned that it was the side where they went in for the septum straightening, so it may take a week or two to go completely back to normal. \n\nThere's so much air through my nose now it feels weird. I'm sure I'll get used to it soon. There's still some residual pinching pain, especially on the right, but things are looking good! I'll probably post less often, unless something crazy happens. Next cleanout is in two weeks--I'll be sure to update on the long term outcomes. Full recovery can take a while, after all. \n\nDay 14: Two weeks out \n\nI'm doing quite well. Very little bleeding (I did make the mistake of sticking my finger in my nose to see how things were doing and triggered some oozing, but that was all) and I'm getting lots of air, especially through my left nostril. The right is still a tad swollen, though not enough to block airflow appreciably, and I am getting lots of thick post nasal drip still, which is annoying. The primary reason for the surgery was to alleviate the gagging from PND, but I'm not sure if it will work for that. We'll see in a month or two, I suppose.\n\nMy only worry is I'm certain I still have allergies, and it might render the turbinate coblation less helpful (as allergies will make the turbinates swell right back up over time). But right now, despite not being 100% healed, I'm feeling pretty darn good. I'm still noticing the nasal cycle, but much less so. \n\nThe only other remaining annoyance is the remaining sutures--I think they're making the very front of my nose the teeniest bit swollen and sore. But its so minor I barely notice it.\n\nAnd thats how Im doing so far. Ill edit the post and add in more days as they go by.\n"""

However I\'m also taking xanax for anxiety and prozac. I have heard the hydrochlorothiazide shouldn\'t be mixed with Adderall because it kind of interacts with it. Which makes sense since the hydrochlorothiazide removes the extra salt and adderall is a ""salt"" right?  Any safer blood pressure med I sound ask about? \nWell my Dr. Said he now would like to add effexor xr to my current meds, including with the adderall but stopping the prozac. Adderall has been my lifesaver,  xanax helps with sleep. Prozac does nothing which is why Dr. Asked if I would like effexor combined with the adderall. \nWell my first concern is my heath. I don\'t want to die early as a result of all these mental heath drugs.\nIs it safe to take adderall, effexor, hydrochlorothiazide, and xanax every day? Is there a better option for a blood pressure med that doesn\'t interact with Adderall? \nMy dr. Also mentioned he could add Wellbutrin as well to my cocktail. Just seems like an overload. I am in good physical heath,  work out and eat healthy,  BP is still borderline high.\nI feel normal on the adderall,  that is a must have for me, but I know high blood pressure can cause a lot of problems. So those are my two main concerns. \nAny thoughts,  concerns,  or questions I should ask my Dr? \n\nI will most likely have to edit some of this to add more info.

concerta,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/13eru4i/improving_my_sleep_a_personal_journey/,b'Improving My Sleep: A Personal Journey',,"b'Hello everyone. Ive gone from averaging 4-6 hours a night to 6-8 on most nights. Heres my story and I hope it brings you hope.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My situation**\n\nI am a male in my mid-twenties, and I have struggled with sleep-maintenance and sleep-onset insomnia since I was 10 years old. This means that I often had difficulty both falling asleep and staying asleep. Although there were occasional days when I slept well, I would say that 75% of the time, I woke up feeling unsatisfied with the level of rest I had achieved. I averaged maybe 5-6 hours of sleep, dipping to 3-4 on bad nights when my body needs 7-8. I felt like I was constantly operating at 50% efficiency and over time, this struggle led me to feel as though I was slipping into a pit of despair with no way out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What didnt work**\n\n* Most conventional sleep hygiene and CBT advice\n* Most of the recommendations in Matt Walker\'s book, ""Why We Sleep""\n* Depression/ anxiety medication, including amitripyline and pregabalin\n* ADHD medication, including Medikinet, Ritalin, and Concerta (though I find them invaluable)\n* Supplements, including magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D\n* Various dietary changes, such as carnivore, keto, and vegan diets\\* Watching the sunset (I read somewhere this might help)\n* Exposing myself to early morning light\n* Adjusting my water intake throughout the day\n* Exercise, including weightlifting and running\n* CBD oil\n* Cutting out PMO\n* Dopamine detoxing\n* Acupressure and massages\n* Sleep restriction\n* And many more\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere were weeks when I felt as though both my body and mind were gradually deteriorating, and I was powerless to stop it. It was incredibly frustrating to try so many techniques, only to have them repeatedly fail. Even more maddening was when a strategy would work for a week, only to lose its effectivenessalmost like a placebo effect that wore off each time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**First breakthrough**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy first breakthrough came when I learned about Daniel Erichsen through this subreddit. He is a sleep doctor who is, radically, not out of touch. One of the main takeaways from his videos was the idea that we should not fear being awake, and that sleep is simply the absence of wakefulness. It was refreshing to hear a sleep professional who did not emphasize the mission-critical importance of sleep, approached the matter with compassion, had a deep understanding that people experience genuine unresolvable distress, and that typical CBT advice can be damaging. His suggestions, delivered in an empathetic and informed manner, echoed the frustrating adage that we should ""stop worrying so much about sleep in order to sleep better""  but in a way that didnt feel derisive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom Dr. Erichsen\'s guidance, I learned that regardless of how well I actually slept at night, I should embrace being awake and, at the very least, be comfortable in my bed. This meant shifting my focus away from all the things I could be doing better to sleep and instead concentrating on enjoying my time awake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEmbracing this new mentality was easier said than done, so I took steps to adopt it. I consciously stopped being overly critical of myself for any perceived shortcomings. Whenever I found myself in a negative headspace, I would verbally express my feelings, engaging in a constructive dialogue with myself that involved negotiating, apologizing, and forgiveness, much like talk therapy. While my sleep quality was still poor, I felt less miserable, which was a huge win.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Second Breakthrough**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith some of the pressure alleviated, I began to view bedtime and sleep as experiences to be grateful for and enjoy. From this refreshed and playful perspective, I committed to trying new strategies without the ""all-or-nothing"" or ""I need this to change my life"" approach. If a new strategy didn\'t work, it was no big deal; if it led to a 5% improvement in any metric, I would be grateful for the incremental progress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI discovered that my sleep maintenance insomnia primarily stemmed from being a light sleeper, as even the slightest disturbances could jolt me awake. This meant that during the light sleep phase, after completing the deep REM stage, I was particularly susceptible to waking up. Consequently, I realized that increasing my comfort in bed was crucial. The idea was so astonishingly banal, yet it revolutionized my sleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Factors Affecting My Comfort:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* The bed I sleep on\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI first noticed this when I visited my family in Disney Florida and slept on a creaky pull-out mattress, which resulted in abysmal sleep for 5 days straight. The following week, while in Washington with my partner, we slept on the largest, thickest Serta mattress I had ever encountered. Both of us slept soundly for over 8 hours for 3 nights in a row, even on a day when I had to wake up at 5 am to catch a bus. This was mind-blowing for me. The stark contrast between my sleep experiences forced me to consider investing in a better bed setup. I had always assumed that bed quality only mattered for those without insomnia, thinking it simply enhanced already-good sleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter several stressful months, I shipped a Winkbed mattress from the US to my home on the other side of the globe, along with other bedding products such as sheets, mattress covers, and pillows. I DIYed a new bedframe and repainted my room. I quickly became an expert in bedding material, temperature regulation, and spinal support. It was an expensive and time-consuming leap of faith (since I couldn\'t return the items), but I maintained the mindset of ""if it fails, it\'s okay; at least I have a comfortable bed and I tried.""\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand that upgrading your bed can be extremely cost-prohibitive and may not be feasible for everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main point is that my increased comfort was primarily due to the improved bed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Miscellaneous factors\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver the following months, as my sleep gradually improved on the new bed, I started noticing small things that detracted from my comfort. I bought a device to control my air conditioning unit remotely, ensuring that my room and bed were cool before bedtime. I acquired a cooling pack for headaches, which I would sometimes wake up with. I began using my mouthguard again to alleviate morning jaw tightness and relied on Avamys nasal spray when I woke up with a dry mouth, indicating that I wasn\'t breathing through my nose during the night. I avoided snacking late at night because I would wake up with an uncomfortable gut. I changed all my sheets to percale cotton and now I never sweat in bed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point is, I began addressing each minor discomfort one by one. While I can\'t say for certain that any individual change improved my sleep, the cumulative effect transformed my relationship with my bed and sleep. I now love lying down on it, rolling around upon waking up, and going to bed. Eventually, not only did my sleep maintenance insomnia improve, but so did my sleep-onset, and I found myself sleeping faster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand that some of this may seem very *Woooo*, but as someone who is highly analytical and critical of anything that sounds remotely pseudoscientific, simply being kinder to myself and focusing on my comfort and pleasure in bed has been transformative. Its absolutely bizarre that such plain concepts were effective. It\'s worth noting that I emerged from a long period of depression about a year beforehand, which likely contributes to my ability to see things from the perspective that I currently do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still experience sleep issues every few nights, sometimes consecutively. However, I can now reliably return to getting restful sleep. While I continue to face health challenges, such as IBS and SIBO, they are much easier to manage with a refreshed mind and body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you find some value in my experiences. The main takeaway is that even if nothing seems to improve your sleep, there are ways to mitigate the pain and despair it can cause.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo close up, Id like to share a poem that served as a lifeline during some of my darkest moments:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Hope is the thing with feathers -*\n\n*That perches in the soul -*\n\n*And sings the tune without the words -*\n\n*And never stops - at all -*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -*\n\n*And sore must be the storm -*\n\n*That could abash the little Bird*\n\n*That kept so many warm -*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Ive heard it in the chillest land -*\n\n*And on the strangest Sea -*\n\n*Yet - never - in Extremity,*\n\n*It asked a crumb - of me.*\n\n*- Emily Dickinson*'"

I had asked a similar question to my ortho awhile back about steroids and also NSAIDs in there role of helping with bulging or herniated discs.  Thought I would pass along what his take was.  \n\nInflammation is the bodies response to damage and to help bring healing factors to that site, however a disc out of its natural space isnt something that the body can heal in the traditional sense.   The disc material needs back in its space or in case of herniation the leaking material washed away.    In this case inflammation is hindering some of the discs ability to go back into the disc space.  By swelling it continues to protrude into the nerve space and as the nerve is pressed upon it continues sending distress signals causing something similar to a feedback loop.   The inflammation continues which is whats causing pressure on the nerve which is what causes the inflammation.    Steroid injections seek to stop this loop and NSAIDs can sometimes help enough to allow things to calm down for the disc to pull back towards the space it should be in.   He says they like to call it inflammation soup or stew.   Its a situation where the bodies natural responses are working in a way not really intended. Allergic reactions are an immune response but that doesnt mean that its a natural one working in an intended way.'"

(62M)',,"b""62M, white, 230 lbs., 5'11, diabetes, afib, low BP. Meds: medipropol and another one that starts with M (one to raise BP, one to lower HR), gabapentin, blood thinners\n\nBackstory: my Dad was in the hospital for a couple weeks because he was in AFIB that had been untreated for a while. He had initially gone to his GP because he was having a lot of pain in his side and upper back, but his heart rate was 170 so they sent him to the hospital, where he stayed 17 days. The AFIB was causing CHF symptoms so they had him on Lasix to help remove fluid but that was messing with his kidneys so they took him off of it before he left. When he left, he was still in AFIB because the cardioversion hadn't corrected the issue but they felt he was improving with medication and wanted to discuss ablation at a later date as an outpatient procedure.\n\nHe went back to the ER a few days later because the pain in his side/back was worsening, even with norco at night, and he wasn't sleeping. They couldn't do morphine because the AFIB makes his BP run low, but eventually were able to give him some fentanyl (didn't touch the pain) and later, dilaudid. \n\nThe next day he was feeling somewhat better and they had been giving him dilaudid every 6 hours with norco at the 3rd hour to bridge the pain. His cardio doc came in and said he didnt think it was heart related and actually found a muscle band in his ribs that he said may just be strained. Around 11 am when they said it was time for his pain meds, his nurse said he'd just do the Dilaudid and Norco at the same time. He was feeling pretty good and we even took a short walk in the hall. Around 3 PM he had severe pain and dizziness, and by the time I got back to the hospital, around 4, he was in and out of passing out. They got him into bed and he was vomiting a bit and then he had to hurry to the restroom where there was significant blood in his stool (some black but mostly red). He then fell to the ground and needed assistance. They took him to ICU where they later told us his BP was almost non-existent when he got there. \n\nThey did a CT scan, checked for stroke, EKG, and then after a few days of stopping blood thinners and taking coagulants, did a colonoscopy and endoscopy to find the source of the GI bleed. Surgeon found nothing of note and said it was likely colitis that was healing on its own. His vitals are looking good and he's leaving the ICU today. \n\nHe asked a nurse why all this happened, and she mentioned that it could have been the fact that the norco and dilaudid were given at the same time.\n\n I'm not sure how things work with medicine dispensation but I assume if you're giving medication that interacts with each other, some kind of warning would come up when they're scanned in. I'm not sure of the doses. \n\nOther medical stuff: He also ended up testing positive for covid that night (he's vaxxed, has had it before and was asymptomatic) and also was told he had pneumonia earlier that day that they were treating with abx. He had a lung scan done and they did find a pleural effusion but the doctor wasn't concerned about it. \n\nSo could this have been just a bodily system failure because he was dealing with so much? The BP was around 90/70 when we were there so not ideal but the median has been around 74. We still haven't figured out what the pain was, if it was the colitis or pneumonia or from sitting weird in a hospital for 3 weeks but he was in absolute agony for days so it seems weird it'd be that. \n\nAll that said, he is doing much better today and has been inspected top to bottom so his doctors feel they have a good idea of his general health right now and should be discharging him soon. He just mentioned the double medication thing today and I'm sure the hospital would never admit fault but it's also really frightening to think that this could have been caused by overmedication when I assumed that wasn't really possible in a hospital setting.\n\nThank you for any input. I'm just a little nervous about him going home and I desperately want to have an idea of what may have happened so we can hopefully prevent it in the future."""
amoxicillin,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/10cxytl/being_sick_for_two_months_has_caused_another/,b'Being sick for two months has caused another depression episode and an ED relapse',,"b'\nHi everyone, Im a 19 year old girl whos been struggling with depression, OCD, and disordered eating for as long as I can remember. Life is tough, but Ive managed to push through with coping mechanisms, external support, and medication. But recently, no matter what I do, I feel stuck in a state of severe depression with a relapsing eating disorder. \n\nI started working at a daycare November 14th. Before I started working there, I had caught RSV from my niece. I was actually on the mend when I first started working, but a child came in with COVID-19 and I caught it. I assume that my weakened immune system from the RSV left me vulnerable to COVID-19. Right after having COVID, I ended up in urgent care with a severe sinus infection. On top of all this, Ive been dealing with side effects and complications from medication. My body is still getting adjusted to Wellbutrin and the amoxicillin for the sinus infection caused an acid reflux flare up so bad that I couldnt swallow properly for a week. Honestly, these last two months have been awful.\n\nIve since recovered from my physical illnesses, but Im still facing the repercussions of them. I went from 140 pounds to 122 pounds (the cause of my relapse), I deal with random migraines now, and my depression hasnt been this bad since high school. I feel like a codependent loser right now because Ive been leaning on my friends and family to keep my head above water. They say that its okay and that Im not bothering them but I still feel so bad. Ive been feeling completely worthless, basically. If it wasnt for them, Id probably be in the hospital.\n\nMy suicidal thoughts are trying to come back and I cant seem to climb out of this hole. Im just so frustrated with feeling like shit; I cant even get out of bed some days. I dunno when the medicine will kick in and I feel like Im going insane. If anyone has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated. Im so sorry for how long this is.'"

corticosteroid rash,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/9e72eg/my_unofficial_guide_to_surviving_accutane_holy/,b'My unofficial guide to surviving Accutane: holy grail products and routine',,"b""This is a compilation of the most useful tips and products for me on Accutane. This subreddit has been extremely helpful for me and I wanted to share what I have found helpful in hopes that others will do the same. This is thorough and might be a bit much for people who aren't super into skincare, but hopefully it will be useful for some.\n\n**General comments about finding products:** First off, talk to your dermatologist. They will give recommendations (often CeraVe or other gentle, fragrance-free formulations for sensitive skin), and they can usually provide samples! When that is not enough, peruse the pharmacy for soothing products that are marketed towards people with eczema or psoriasis, or towards actual babies. Products for these groups are designed for your sensitive skin - use them! I frequent the baby aisle and have found great body washes and creams there. If you, like me, enjoy skincare, do look into French, Japanese, and especially Korean skincare. I find these to be really great for sensitive skin in need of moisture. If you are interested in this, check out /r/AsianBeauty and /r/SkincareAddiction. Becoming familiar with good ingredients and common irritants is helpful in order to buy products that work. For me, accutane has been a lot of trial and error, which means I've bought products that did not work for me and I only used a few times. This is bad for your skin and wallet!\n\nSome resources for this:\n\n[COSDNA:](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/) view a product's ingredients, their purpose, and the safety of the ingredient. The database might not have every product you are interested in, but it can give you some familiarity with skincare ingredients.\n\n[Paula's Choice Ingredient Dictionary:](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary) look up specific ingredients you are curious about.\n\n**A note about my skin:** I had mild but persistent acne and very sensitive, extremely combination skin (very oily sometimes and very dry at others, or even all at once - ugh)I am on my fifth month of Accutane at my peak dose of 80mg. I started with 20mg and went up every month. My worst side effects (primarily just dryness) were always when my dose was upped. I had a breakout every month when my dose went up as well.\n\n**My most useful products:**\n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask:** hands down the best lip treatment I have tried. I use it day and night. Nothing can compare! I love that it moisturizes and provides an occlusive barrier. The problem for me with Aquaphor is that it provides an occlusive barrier, but when I apply it on extremely dry lips, it doesn't have much effect and I have to reapply within a few minutes. I attribute this to the fact that the lips are too dry for it to actually do anything unless there is already some moisture underneath. That's why Laneige is great. Sometimes I apply it and then apply Aquaphor, which is THE BEST. Unfortunately, Laneige is not great for bringing on the go. I usually make do with the mini tubes of Aquaphor when Im out of the house.\n\n**Hada Lobo Hyaluronic Acid Lotion:** very much a game changer for me. A liquid step before moisturizer has been essential to maintaining semi-normal skin during my course, and hyaulronic acid is one of the best skincare ingredients you can find for dry skin. I use this as soon as I finish washing my face or get out of the shower, and follow up a minute or so after with moisturizer. Can't emphasize enough how useful this has been.\n\n**HPR Plus emollient foam:** this is a prescription moisturizer and it has been one of the best things that I have used for body dryness - I haven't really used it on my face but you can do that as well. Much of my course has been during the summer, which has been a particularly hot, humid, and sticky one, making moisturizing my body problematic. In order to get the moisture I need, I was using thick creams, which combined with humidity, were making me sticky to the touch. It was extremely unpleasant for me on 95 degree days with high humidity levels. My dermatologist recommended this and it is excellent. I use it as soon as I get out of the shower. It has completely fixed my body's dry skin and it does not make me sticky at all. If you dont want to go prescription with this, look for a foam moisturizer. I dont know of any good ones but Im sure they are out there!\n\n**Cloderm:** another prescription, this one a corticosteroid. This is great for dry areas of skin that simply do not respond to anything else. In my third month, I developed red, itchy, and flaky patches of skin on my legs that were inflamed constantly. Essentially, they were patches of eczema. My doctor gave me samples of this to use and it cleared these up. The only thing is that you should not use this regularly. My derm said no more than 2 weeks of use at a time. If you dont want to get a prescription, you could try an OTC hydrocortisone cream. Just dont overdo it!\n\n**Supplements:** I regularly take **Fish oil, vitamin E, and fiber supplements**. For fish oil and vitamin E - both of these supplements will help with dryness and with the absorption of the medicine. I take them at the same time as I take my pill. Fiber - A weirder and especially unpleasant symptom for me was regular upset stomach. It is not really painful upset stomach but it caused constipation (something Id never had an issue with) and essentially made my stool, well, messiersorry, I know, grossbut yeahit happens! This is THE WORST on accutane, because if you have to wipe a lot, then the skin down there gets dry and irritated and it is truly awful. Fiber supplements helped fix this for me almost completely. Prior to it being fixed, I found using wipes and diaper rash cream helpful. Diaper rash cream is definitely the strangest product I have had to buy because of accutane but it really helped with the dry and irritated skin down there when it was really bad. I only had to use it a few times but it helped!\n\n**Konjac sponges:** Sometimes you just really have to get rid of the flaky skin on your face and body. Konjac sponges are a very gentle way to do so. I recommend using them sparingly...twice a week AT MOST and only if your skin is super flaky/dry/rough. I generally use them in the shower and immediately follow with moisturizer.\n\n**My current routine:**\n\nAM: wash face with **La Roche Posay Toleraine Hydrating Gentle Cleanser.** PM: if wearing makeup, use **cleansing oil** (Kose Softymo or Banila), followed by same cleanser used in AM.AM: Apply **Hada Lobo Hyaulronic Lotion.** PM: apply **COSRX Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence** after Hada Lobo.\n\nPM: If I have whiteheads I will apply **hydrocolloid acne patches** to them.\n\nAM: Apply **COSRX Hyaulronic Acid Intensive Cream**, followed by **Avene Clean-Ac cream**. PM: apply **COSRX Hyaulronic Acid Intensive Cream**, followed by **Avene Cicalfate cream**. (Note about this: the 2 moisturizer method is the only thing that will keep my skin moisturized all day. The COSRX cream is really great but doesnt do the job alone. I use a small amount of the Avene Clean-AC a few seconds after to seal my moisturizer. If my undereyes are particularly dry I will use an eye cream in addition to the COSRX which I put under my eyes. Right now I am using a sample of Caudalies Premier Cru).\n\nPM: Apply **Aquaphor** to super dry spots. This was unfathomable to me pre-accutane but is very helpful! Sometimes I use **The Ordinary Rosehip Oil**. I used it more during the super-dry periods when my dose had gone up by mixing it into my PM moisturizer. Now, I only dab it on healing spots that are dry and flaky. It seems to help heal them and reduce the length of lingering redness.\n\nBoth AM and PM I use **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** on my lips, and dab **Aquaphor** in the corners of my mouth to make sure they dont crack. If they are very cracked, I apply a tiny bit of **Cloderm** and follow it with **Aquaphor**. If my lips are even drier than usual, I  combine **Laneige** and **Aquaphor**.\n\nMakeup I try to keep minimal but I find it necessary for work. I use **Dr. Jart+ Cicapair Derma Green-Cure Solution Recover Cream**. This is similar to a BB/CC cream and is excellent for redness, especially for someone super pale like me. It has enough SPF for my limited time in direct sunlight on a work day (if I know Im going to be outside in the sun I wear a hat). I use **NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer** for spots. I try not to use powder and instead use an **Urban Decay setting spray**.\n\n***Please share thoughts, feedback, and recommendations!***"""

I was in a car crash 3 years ago, and Ive been dealing with lots of issues from it, but my doctors think its something other than the car crash that made everything flare up so bad and continue for so long. ive had nerve pain which has been progressively getting worse/spreading, and muscle spasms, ever since the accident. i was diagnosed with fibromyalgia prior to the crash, but after seeing a rheumatologist she looked at my blood tests and told me it was a misdiagnosis. rheumatoid factor was also negative. At some point last year, my doctor said she thought it might be celiacs disease which made a lot of sense to me. those blood tests came back positive for celiac disease, but they took a gastric biopsy and the gastro told me it wasnt celiacs disease. my doctor has checked for multiple autoimmune issues but hasnt found anything, and my MRIs and x-rays come back clean every time except for mild arthritic deterioration and trace disc bulges, although they insist its not arthritis. the only thing theyve given me that helps w the pain is gabapentin. i know this is a long shot but at this point im at a stand still until we figure out exactly whats going on, and im tired of constantly going between my GP and specialists and doing testing only for their best guesses being wrong, or to tell me nothings wrong. anyone have any guesses, or experienced something similar? attached images of some of the testing that came back flagged aswell as my c-spine MRI.'"

Partly because Im doing awesome. There is a lot of truth to what they say about the people who are doing well.\n\nThey say the people doing well dont post on the internet because they are too busy living their lives to document their story. \n\nWell Im going to attempt to not be that person eventually Im going to compile this into a blog that hopefully will help others who get to this point in their life.\n\nNow onto the updates:\n\nDay 7:\nThe incision continued to itch but was better than it had been. The pain on 3000mg of Tylenol a day was about a 1-2 and I was stiff moving about but not actively painful.\n\nI walked a lot my watch clocked me at 2 miles of walking that day with about 4,500 steps its winter here so most of that was indoors around my house but Im doing 2 out door walks a day lasting 15-20m\n\nDay 8: \nI sent my wife to get a massage while I watched our 4 year old. She knows Daddy cant pick her up and cant bend over or really kneel for long to play dolls with her. There might have been more iPad watching than I like but my wife got out of the house for 3 hours and came back refreshed with a massage, haircut, and some time spent with a book and a coffee.\n\nMy daughter and I survived. Truly better than survived. Thursdays have been Daddy Bean days since she was born I have 1 day off mid week and I have stayed home with her almost every single one since she was born. Its been Thursday for the last 2 years. She and I have really missed our Daddy Bean time because in the run up to surgery I stayed home on Thursdays but it wasnt the same especially as my symptoms worsened.\n\nDay 9: \nIts Friday, my wife went out with girlfriends to see a movie. Wait lets go back a moment... I drove in a car today... wait one more second I drove the car.... \n\nFriday was a pretty impressive day. My pain has been super well controlled (almost nothing) and my stiffness is way down almost to the point of not being there. I now need to be super careful not to overdo it. My mantra of no lifting, bending, twisting is constant.\n\nSo to start the day off getting out of bed... Im still experiencing the left leg pain & cramping when getting out of bed and Im most sore in the morning. But its lasting less and less time. Its down from 2 hours to now about 20-30 minutes and far less severe. Im sleeping on my back I dont trust myself not to twist if I sleep on my side and I still use pillows to wedge myself in.\n\nAfter getting settled, coffee, etc... my wife and I decided that I could in fact go out and lunch was a good idea. She drove... driving is interesting its not comfortable, nor painful or uncomfortable its just not the same... its a thing that before was a nothing but now its a something. I cant describe it better than that. I expect it to get better though. \n\nWe had lunch together and I was able to sit down in a restaurant for the first time in 6 months. It was awesome. I did take some time to walk a bit after we ate but lunch was about 45 minutes of sitting and I did just fine. Perfect posture and no bending down to my food though. Fork to mouth instead of mouth to fork...\n\nAfterwards I drove. It took a bit to readjust car seat I had it a very particular location pre surgery to accommodate a very interesting and not particularly safe driving position. Once I had it mostly right away we went. It was strange but not good or bad. We headed to a home goods store. Generally we can both admire furniture I can admire kitchen gadgets she can ogle soap and we can both cringe at all the pink things our daughter would say she wanted and could t live without. We walked through there for 45m before heading home.\n\nLater that evening I cooked her dinner, she got out all the pots and put everything in the dishwasher but I did the cooking. After dinner she took off and I watched our daughter until bed. Bedtime was interesting the downstairs was trashed but I convinced her to help me get most of it cleaned up. I still spent more time on my knees that I should have. But we succeeded and I had the downstairs spotless by the time I went to bed a few hours after my daughter. It was a good night even if I probably over did it. Fortunately, no symptoms to suggest I hurt anything.\n\nBasically it was the most normal day Ive had in 6 months and it was 9 days after microdisectomy surgery.\n\nDay 10:\n\nNot much to report I slept in. I had little pain and less stiffness. Sleeping in hurt the walking as I had less time to do it but I walked 25 minutes today once. We had a friend over dinner and then played board games. It was again feeling like a normal day.\n\n\nSome take take aways. Im super careful not bend. I had to ask my friend to pick up a dice I dropped right next to my foot. I could have done it but the bending.... I picked up my cat he weighs about 12-15lbs I realized that was a bad idea and put him down about a minute later.\n\nMy leg feels weird. Their is rarely pain but it just feels odd weird feelings are the best way to describe it. Not tingling or numbness and definitely not pain. Its like my nerve is trying to say things but doesnt have the right words. However, it also seems like its no longer shouting for attention.\n\nI do a lot of standing and minor pacing. Its more comfortable than sitting. Also sitting I have to get up before I really get comfortable. I set a 20-30 minute alarm on my watch and get up when it goes off, never staying seated for more than an hour and if I do Im stiff and its a mistake...\n\nAs for medications:\n500mg Tylenol 4x a day\n220mg Naproxen 3x a day (the bottle says no more than 2, if you have kidney issues or any reason to not take NSAIDS be really careful exceeding the dosage on the bottle)\nDocusate Sodium/Colace 2x a day one capsule\nGabapentin 300mg 4x a day.\nDiazepam 5mg 2x a day\n\nGiven my pain is well under control Im going to taper the Tylenol down to 500mg 2-3x a day and the Naproxen 2x a day on Tuesday and see how I do. My 2 week post op is Thursday and I want to make sure my pain is resolved and not being masked by pain medications. The diazepam is for muscle spasms and since the stiffness has mostly gone away Im going to taper that down to before bed at the same time.\n\nAsks questions I might update tomorrow or it might be a few days again.'"

I am a 30yo Caucasian male living in B.C. Canada, and the last few weeks have been quite troubling, experiencing an array of strange destressing physical and psychological symptoms. \n\nI took serious notice about three weeks ago, but thinking back I think it may have started earlier without me realizing, as my mental state seemed to be in unexplained decline for a week or so prior. \n\n^^^^^\n\nI do suffer from long term depression, anxiety, and addiction (On suboxone and also self medicate with vyvanse and ritalin daily at a typical ADHD dosage, as well as clonazepam a couple times a week when needed, all of the above at the same dosage for years so with no changes so I don't think it's related to that)\n\nIt started with waking up really groggy and unrested a few weeks ago, which I struggle with from time to time but it was extra intense and I also was experiencing much more dissociation and depersonalization than normal which i've also struggled with for over ten years. This was just a few weeks after a period where I was using psilocybin for the first time therapeutically, and it was a mental health breakthrough for me. I had never felt so confident and optimistic about my situation and the future, so this sudden drop in well being was a curveball for me.\n\n^^^^^\n\nThe same week that the intense brain fog kicked in, I also had a dull headache behind the eyes and dull joint pain/back pain that first lasted a few days. On day 4-5, things started getting really bad, I started feeling very strange and very out of it 24/7, and knowing how anxiety and depression effects me long term, this was very unusual and I had a strong sense that it wasn't psychological in nature. For a few days I also had this feeling of numbness that was both physical and mental, it felt strange to touch my skin, as if I was anesthetized, a dull tingly feeling all over my body but also mentally, I was very slow cognitively. I was sensitive to temperature as well, and on the night before the blood test I woke up a number of times feeling hot, but didn't get a chance to see if I had a fever.\n\nI called a doctor and went for blood tests, but the day of the blood test I felt most of the numbness and intense fatigue symptoms subsided. I checked my results a couple days later and everything looked normal besides being just below normal range in hemoglobin, and I have a follow up appointment in a couple days in which I will be reporting all my latest symptoms.\n\n^^^^^\n\nThings got weirder though, for 2-3 days after the blood test I felt a lot better physically, but was still having much higher than normal dissociation and symptoms of stress/depression. Then, after a few days of feeling like maybe I was getting better I started feeling extremely depressed, with extreme anhedonia, a lot of intrusive thoughts and dread, which despite suffering from many mental health low points over the years, this was more intense and seemed to be beyond my conscious influence as there were no moments where it let up, it was very consistent. After a few days of feeling like I was on the brink of having some sort of unexplained breakdown I started getting some more pain, dull back pain, and then I woke up one morning to notice that I was getting random muscle twitches all over my body, which started three days ago and has been consistent since then and not something I have experienced before. It feels like there is some electrical malfunction with my nervous system, and it feels as if my body is under some constant electrical voltage if that makes any sense. Every 30 seconds to a minute I have a small muscle twitch in a completely different area on my body, even muscles I normally don't have control over.\n\n^^^^^\n\nAnd then two days ago, I also realized that I hadn't had a bowel movement what must be over a week now, which is very very bizarre because my appetite has been normal and I didn't feel any discomfort until it crossed my mind, I just came to the realization one day that I hadn't had one in a loooong time, 2-3x longer than I remember ever waiting, and now two days later, I still haven't and it's incredibly strange as i've been eating constantly and don't even really feel bloated or plugged up except for today in which i'm starting to feel some intestinal pressure. I took magnesium citrate last night because it previously made me run to the toilet (that's not why I had taken it but I switched to another magnesium supplement due to that side effect) and so far it's done nothing.  As of now i'm just starting to get a stomach ache for the first time, I have some lower back pain, and I just feel this vague but deep sense that there is something wrong, i'm high strung and feel unconsciously tense, I can relax my muscles fine but there is an underlying sense of tension through my body and mind, and still twitching as I type this. And I am still feeling dissociated (depersonalization) a lot, like the most i've been in ten years over the past few weeks, which is saying a lot because it used to dominate my life and I really thought I had gotten over it, I don't have panic attacks anymore, but it still just presents itself and disconnects me from my surroundings and there is nothing I can do about it. There is just no comparison to how I feel now VS 1-2 months ago, I really felt amazing, was starting to get my life in order, and now that feels like another lifetime, even the memory of it feels fuzzy and if I didn't keep a journal I might not even believe it was my reality because it seems so far away from where I am now.\n\n^^^^^\n\nIf one or two of the above had happened, I would have called it coincidence, but there is just no way that I am getting such a range of specific symptoms that I normally don't suffer from without any chance in diet or activity, I just can't wrap my head around it and there are no conditions I can find online that match the list of symptoms. I tested negative for covid during the peak of me feeling ill last week too. Is there any condition that even has a slim possibility of causing all of the above??"""

amitriptyline,https://www.reddit.com/r/ambien/comments/hj0l30/zolpidem_and_biperiden_combination_trip_report/,b'Zolpidem and Biperiden Combination Trip Report.',,"b""Hey everyone i'm writing a trip report on the combination of Zolpidem and the anticholinergic deliriant Biperiden (commonly known by it's brand name Akineton). For those of you who are curious, Biperiden is an anticholinergic commonly used for Parkinson's Disease and it's also one of the few euphoric anticholinergic deleriants there is much like Trihexyphenidyl (Artane) and Biperiden is a popular drug of abuse in Greece where it's used as a substitute for Trihexyphenidyl and occasionally combined with alcohol and Cannabis. I chose to do a trip report on this combo because anticholinegic deliriants enhance the visuals from Zolpidem and ive combined Zolpedim with other anticholinergics like Cyclobenzaprine and Amitriptyline and have had intense trips with those combos and saw shadow people and the works. \n\nSome facts about me, I weigh 160 pounds (approximately 72.6 kilograms) and I take 300 milligrams of Pregabalin (Lyrica) a day for fibromyalgia and 16 milligrams of Suboxone a day for opioid dependence I developed using opioids to manage my fibro pain because Pregabalin barely works and my pain management doctor sucks ass. I'm also prescribed 2 milligrams of Eszopiclone (Lunesta) for sleep and I can't remember the last time I used it as it shares a cross tolerance with Zolpidem and Zaleplon. Now without further adieu here's the trip report.\n\n1:50 AM, Took 5 milligrams of Biperiden (the typical deliriant dose of Biperiden is 10 milligrams) on an empty stomach.\n\n2:05 AM, Took the last 20 milligrams of Zolpedim from my old script on an empty stomach.\n\n2:30 AM, I'm feeling a warm flash throughout my body which is the Biperiden's doing, other anticholinergic drugs have similar effects. I'm also feeling the calmness from the Ambien coming up as well.\n\n2:50 AM, Thing's seem brighter and my vision is blurry as fuck despite taking out my contacts and putting them back in. I'm tempted to redose 5 more milligrams of Biperiden to to reach a full blown trip as I figured this combo would be more intense than my 10 milligram Amitripyline and 20 milligram Zolpidem trip. so far I just feel super calm and the visuals aren't as intense as I thought or would like them to be.\n\n2:55 AM,  Redosed another 5 milligrams of Biperiden thus bringing me up to 10 milligrams of Biperiden and 20 milligrams of Zolpidem. Time to get wonkier than Willy Wonka, ;D Fire up the clown car Lando I'm coming to visit. :D\n\n5:45 AM I don't remember much what happened in between in the time from 3:00 AM to now although I vaguely remember it had me walking around like a drunken zombie me and I watched South Park and I listened to the songs Disclosure and Esoteric Agenda by The HAARP Machine (music sounded pretty nice on this combo). Also the walls were breathing, the letters on my phone's keyboard were moving around and the emoji's took on a 3D texture, and the paintings in my grandparents house were moving around which was pretty cool I guess, my vision is still blurry as fuck which I found made trying to type and and reply to messages pretty difficult considering the letters looked weird on my screen and were wiggling around or looked quite different. I'm about to go to sleep and update when I wake up.\n\n12:00 PM I wake up and still feel some residual effects from the Biperiden like dry mouth, dilated pupils, and a mild calm feeling that wasn't as intense as last night (it has an elimination half life of 18 hours so I suppose residual effects from a 10 milligram dose is indeed a possibility).\n\nAll in all i'd say this was an interesting  combination I may repeat in the future when I get my hands on more Zolpedim. Oddly enough I didnt see shadow people on this combo... o.O However this combo seemed to become more amnesiac after taking 10 milligrams of Biperiden but with a 5 milligram dose of Biperiden it was quite calming, anxiolytic, and has a mild euphoria to it. Anyways that was my experience with this combination, I hope everyone enjoys reading this."""

This free radical then has the ability to produce other ROS, such as peroxides, resulting in oxidative damage that may include lipid peroxidation and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. The skin is especially susceptible to resultant oxidative damage, as it is chronically exposed to ROS-induced oxidative stress that is generated both from endogenous (inside the body) and exogenous sources (outside the body).""\n\n<snip> ""Endogenous sources of ROS in the skin include auto-oxidation and enzymatic oxidation.""\n\n<snip> In addition to endogenous sources, photooxidation and pollutant/environmental oxidants also contribute to the pathogenesis of acne via the production of ROS. All unsaturated lipids are suspect to photooxidation in the presence of sensitizers, such as ultraviolet (UV) light.""\n\n<snip> ""The involvement of free radical oxidation (FRO) in each of the major abnormalities associated with acne has been suggested, as ROS and lipid peroxidation may play a role in the initiation and progression of epithelial inflammation in the pilosebaceous unit.2,5,7-10 In acne, sebum composition is altered. Lipid peroxidation of fatty acids and unsaturated triterpenes, such as squalene, generates both intracellular and extracellular ROS. The generation of ROS can alter the viscosity and composition of sebum.5,14 In fact, the excessive sebum production in acne is expected to promote the generation of excess ROS, leading to oxidative stress within the follicle, thus overwhelming the antioxidant system of the skin.5,14""\n\nThe article goes on to explain how the domino effect then happens to other areas of the skin, resulting in scarring, follicle impaction etc and recommends research into the use of topical anti-oxidants.\n\nHappy to chat about this with people as this is my area of expertise, and suggest some anti-oxidant therapies.'"

I don't think so for a few reasons and do believe that I have some mental illness/disorders. I think I have depression, social anxiety or general anxiety, and I pretty sure I have schizoid personality disorder. I also have trichotillomania which is some form of ocd. I also forgot to add I might have substance use disorder or just dependent.\n\nStarted noticing that I've really haven't been happy or in a good mood since 2017 but have become worse and felt i haven't been in a happy mood more than 2 days a week since like 2021. At best feeling neutral for a whole week. I offten have low energy and have very bad insomnia and melatonin doesn't work for me. Then time to time I feel worthless and have suicidal ideation at least 3 or 4 days a week. (This is why  I think I have depression) \n\nMy whole life I've always been quiet and shy and I am 23. Along with this I constantly am worried and anxious when I go to work and off since I work in the hospital and go to college too. Feels like I have no free time. But I also tend to not want to be around people and interact with people so I usually stay quiet until I get asked a question or need to ask one. When I do get the courage or if I feel like interacting with people and try to meet people or make friends I always talk quietly. Sometimes I just quickly stop the conversation and leave because I was getting to nervous. For relationships, I don't want to date or have sex because I'm simply not interested into dating and spending that much time with someone that close for my whole life and for the sex part I just don't want kids ever and I think sex is gross anyways. I really do like my alone time and I think I don't want to date or get married because of all the bad relationships I've seen in my life and rather not go through that. So that's why I'm pretty sure that schizoid personality disorder. But I also think I might be Aromantic abd Asexual but I don't mind not labeling myself as long people understand I don't want a relationship and sex. \n\nMy last point is that I either have substance use disorder or just dependent. It is because I have a lot of medical problems like sickle cell anemia and lots of back and hip pain and a few headaches. feel very fatigued as well from this and have very bad insomnia.  So I just use Hydrocodone a lot that I was prescribed. And when I say a lot I mean I usually use all 30 pill within 2 weeks or under. It takes 2 pills to get through the day,  4 pills a day to feel alright and 6 to get high. I never taken 7 or 8 pills in a day. Side note can't take anything like ibuprofen or advil because I'm allergic to NSAIDS so I can only take tylenol or opiates. \n\nDon't want to make this post any longer so any thoughts if I should go to therapy or not?"""

Dentist said it needed a filling and a crown, but not a root canal. Tooth didn\'t hurt much but had some sensitivity. I generally trust my dentist, said ok, lets do this.\n\nThe crown appointment was rough. They had to give me three or four shots, and still didn\'t get me fully numb. Mouth, lips, and tongue were numb, but not the tooth fully. I could feel it when they drilled down really deep. Fortunately, the part I could feel was at the very end, and they finished, installed the temporary crown and sent me home.\n\nAs soon as the numbing wore off, I was in PAIN. Aching pain within the tooth that over the counter pain relievers helped with, but it always came back, and got worse as time went on. Waited about a week, when it started waking me up in my sleep, which the dentist had said to watch for, and then called my dentist. They had me come in that day and did some tests and a bite adjustment. Sanded the tooth down really far because they kept having me bite on a bite stick and if I said it hurt, they took more off. It always hurt.\n\nThe pain didn\'t go away, and continued to worsen. Called several days later, and the dentist said to give it more time, and if I ""couldn\'t take it"" by the time the appointment for the crown installment, they could do a root canal instead. \n\nThe pain continued to worsen, and at my appointment I was given the option of putting on the permanent crown and waiting the pain out, or having the root canal. I opted for the root canal.\n\nThey again couldn\'t get me numb in that specific tooth for the root canal, despite giving me four or five shots (I lost count) at different points in the procedure when I said I felt pain, and in the end the problem nerve was still ""live"" when they pulled it out. They had to take breaks for me to cry and shake because I was in so much pain, and the initial shots were also excruciating. I asked for gas to take the edge off, but they didn\'t offer that. Once they got the problem nerve out it was fine, but it was an ordeal to get to that point. I was very sore for... three or four days after that, but it has gone better as time has gone on.\n\nI have my second root canal appointment next week, and I am dreading it, even though the problem nerve is now gone. My understanding is that they need to make sure the tooth is clean, fill it, and attach the permanent crown. Is this going to hurt? Can I trust my dentist to finish this properly? Should I get the crown and take it to some other dentist to finish it, someone who can give me gas or something else to help with the pain, or numb the tooth properly?\n\n(I do not drink, smoke, or do recreational drugs, and I can\'t take NSAIDs for more than a couple days at a time without it giving me horrible heartburn due to previous stomach issues.

I have a feeling that either the AHA+ or the added copper is hurting my progress, which is a shame.  I got a blood test a few weeks ago that showed my copper/zinc levels were fine, right before I started to take the copper, so I'm wondering if I was actually deficient in zinc in the first place and I might have screwed that balance up.  It's a real bummer, because I was clear for such a long period of time!  The reason I started the AHA was to speed up the process of getting rid of those, and it did help.  But I fear it might have made my acne worse in the process.  Another possibility is the cleansing step causing problems, as I've noted before.  I tried a few things, such as using a clay mask, BP spot treatment, using some nights with AHA on and some nights with it off, and upping to 50mg of zinc daily instead of 36, but I haven't noticed a marked improvement.  I've tried some anti-inflammatories too such as advil, aspirin, to no real avail.  So, I'm reverting to my last known good configuration, which is:\n\nDay:\n\n* shower, use cold water for last 30 seconds of shower\n* optional shave\n* moisturizer + tea tree oil\n* 36mg zinc + 0.9mg copper (11mg zinc + 0.9 copper provided by multivitamin)\n\nNight:\n\n* moisturizer + tea tree oil\n\nThat regimen seems to have worked the best for me, so far.  I'm thinking after I get it under control again, I'll try some kind of retinoid instead to get the redness down.  This may be TMI, but for the guys reading this, I'm going to also do /r/NoFap while abiding by this regimen, as I've read that it'll boost your zinc levels.  Whether it'll matter or not, well, hard to say.\n\nWish me luck, and as you all know I will keep you updated."""

I've been on ambien almost nightly for several years and while it certainly takes care of my insomnia, it has the lovely side effects of daytime fatigue and brain fog. For the longest time I thought I'd just have to accept it and try to push on with life after my last Pdoc basically said to just eat right and exercise, which was certainly good advice in general, but didn't really help my ambien issues. Also recently did a full blood workup which should no issues. So, I finally got off my butt and started digging deep into  how brain fog works and ambien mechanisms along with my depression/anxiety med Effexor.\n\nFrom what my layman mind can gather, brain fog is usually caused by neurotransmitter imbalance. The chief ones being Serotonin, Dopamine, GABA and Acetylcholine. These imbalances often coincide with depression/anxiety. Ambien seems to work by binding to GABA receptors which then release inhibitory neurons which then inhibit other inhibitory neurons for things like dopamine. I barely understand that sentence myself, but I was wondering if any one with knowledge of pharmacology knew if ambien causes neurotransmitter imbalance (too much or too little). My hope is that by finding out where the imbalance is, I could reduce brain fog by correcting the imbalance via supplement, diet or meds.\n\nAny knowledge would be greatly appreciated!"""
penicillin problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/grvwd7/severe_back_chestarms_and_starting_to_appear_on/,"b'SEVERE back, chest,arms, and starting to appear on butt + thigh acne. Please help I dont know what to do anymore :('",,"b'Im 20f, Im not including a picture because i dont feel comfortable. Im gonna include some backstory and what ive tried already and everything. Sorry for any typos or grammar issues im on my phone but ill try my best.\n\nIve had HORRIBLE acne ever since i was little. Like in elementary school. My facial acne was INSANE. We started by trying topicals, my skin was to sensitive and i couldnt handle the topicals well. Eventually i gave up and just let it be, washed my face but that never helped. My back acne developed in elementary school as well but it wasnt bad at all and it wasnt our orimary focus. In middle school into highschool,i used antibiotics because i refused any type of topical. The first one im forgetting the name but was good it helped my facial acne a lot. I was on it for about a year and then i stopped. so my facial acne by highschool was 1000x better and i didnt mind whatever acne i did have because it was just so much better then it was.\n\n But my back acne was horrible, i have so many scars down my entire back. Sometime during my junior year igot on birthcontrol(the patch) which basically cleared up my facial acne. But not my back acne. I then switched to nexplanon which made no difference in my acne. In the beginning of nexplanon( firdt few months) i got a few cysts but those went away and havent had any since.\n\n\nIm sorry i didnt mention this earlier by back acne i also mean the acne down my arms and on my chest and on my neck. \nIts everywhere.\n\nIve tried everything. So in highschool my senior year i switch to another antibiotic. Im allergic to penicillin and i didnt wanna use the one i used before because im against using antibiotics unless you really need to like for real infections. so i tried this antibiotic and had a horrible allergic reaction to it as well lol so i stopped i never wanna use antibiotics again for acne. \n\nThen i started using this spray, which helped but it was just to expensive and i cant afford buying so much product when im using so much it was a small bottle and it only helped a little like not a lot.\n\nIve tried witch hazel, it doesnt help\n\nI tried nizoral. But i also tried going gluten free at the same time. im also worried about it affecting my birthcontrol so i dont plan to try nizoral again.\nI stopped nizoral but remained gluten free and i was still getting small break outs. But i did notice my skin clearing up tremendously. But i broke my gluten free diet and now im back to square one.\n\nNow why dont you go back to being gluten free? You might ask.\n\nWell i am, i have been for a few weeks now. But my skin is absolutely terrible. but i always noticed my skin gets worse before it gets better so im hoping thats whats happening.\n\nIve tried megadosing on vitamin b5, this actually helped alot but it made my jaw hurt lol so i stopped. \nSo maybe its a vitamin deficiency but ive been taking multivitamins. And i do actually incorporate vitamin b5 more after noticing it making a difference. \n\nWhy not go see a dermatologist?\nI have. I went to one when i was in hs that prescribed me the antibiotics that gave me a terrible allergic reaction. And i just dont wanna go back. Everybody just wants to treat the symptoms not the actual cause and its so frustrating.\n\n\nBasically what ive been doing now. I take a show every other day where i exfoliate( this isnt the reason im breaking out.), and then i will put aloe very all over my body basically because its basically everywhere besides my legs. But it has started appearing on my butt and upper thighs.\n\nI generally dont wear tight clothes. I mostly wear cotton t shirts or hoodies and pj bottoms that arent fitted just loose. i do weae tight jeans though but ive never had an issue with acne on my butt or legs before. \n\nIm really thinking I may have a intolerance to gluten because i feel so much better when i dont eat gluten and my skin clears. I didnt get bad bloating when i went back to eating gluten before but before i tried gluten free i got bloated so easily and so much. But now i dont bloat. Sorry if that was confusing.\n\nSo im just wondering if any of you have any other possible remedies i can try. If being gluten free doesnt work then i probably do plan to go to my doctor to get referred to a dermatologist even though i really just dont trust dermatologists. Also to get tested for a gluten insensitivity.\n\nIm getting really tired of hiding my skin because people always ask whats wrong with my skin lol and its so annoying because like yeah i see it i know its there if i knew what was causing it id fix it asap. Ive never been able to feel comfortable in tank tops or off the shoulder shirts which i love. i actually wanna live lol im so tired of this my brothers dont have acne problems (we are triplets so we are the same age). I dont wanna feel self conscious of my skin anymore. And once the acne is gone i gotta deal with the scars but aloevera realllyyy helps my scarring so im hoping by using it basically every other day its helping.\n\nIf you read this far thank you im so sorry this post is so long. Id really appreciate any suggestions!'"

citalopram,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/vrjwdz/a_critical_reanalysis_of_a_systematic_review/,b'A critical reanalysis of a systematic review: Davies and Read 2019',,"b'**Need a tl;dr? Skip to the very end.**\n\n[A systematic review into the incidence, severity and duration of antidepressant withdrawal effects: Are guidelines evidence-based?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460318308347?via%3Dihub)\n\n> More than half (56%) of people who attempt to come off antidepressants experience withdrawal effects.  \n>  \n> Nearly half (46%) of people experiencing withdrawal effects describe them as severe.  \n>  \n> It is not uncommon for the withdrawal effects to last for several weeks or months.  \n>  \n> Current U.K. and U.S.A. Guidelines underestimate the severity and duration of antidepressant withdrawal, with significant clinical implications.\n\nDavies and Read are both psychologists who have longstanding grudges against psychiatry. Both have also been chastised for getting papers published with dubious scientific methods.\n\nThe difficulty of meta-analysis is garbage-in, garbage-out. I am somewhat dubious of the conclusions, especially given the biases of the authors, but going through all the included studies to determine whether the conclusion is justified or not is laborious. I actually did a quick peek back when this first released, but it\'s time for a deeper dive. Let\'s go through the publications included in the meta-analysis, or at least the first part.\n\n[Montgomery et al. 2005](https://www.psychiatrist.com/read-pdf/22320/): ""A 24-Week Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Escitalopram for the Prevention of Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder""\n\n>Patients were randomly assigned... to 24 weeks of double-blind treatment with escitalopram (continuing with the dose level administered at the end of the open-label period) or an abrupt switch to placebo.\n\nIt is accurate that 27% of patients switched to placebo had an elevated DESS score at week 1. 16% at week 2. However, this compares to 9% and 8% who were continued; the placebo-controlled discontinuation symptom rate is 18% and 8% at weeks 1 and 2. (Whether this should be normalized for placebo is tricky, since many of the studies don\'t have a control. That is part of the problem.)\n\nBottom line: The study is intended for a different purpose, but it provides reasonably relevant data. The data are misinterpreted by Davies and Read. Severity is not covered.\n\n[Boghetto et al. 2002](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00023210-200216040-00006): ""Discontinuation Syndrome in Dysthymic Patients Treated with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors""\n\n>The mean time at onset of symptoms was 2 days after drug discontinuation and the mean duration was 5 days."" It occurred in 4/45 discontinuing fluoxetine (8.9%) and 22/52 discontinuing paroxetine (42.3%).\n\nBottom line: Yes, this is relevant, but it is not blind and not placebo-controlled. Paroxetine is a standout offender.\n\n[Oehrberg et al. 1995](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/paroxetine-in-the-treatment-of-panic-disorder-a-randomised-doubleblind-placebocontrolled-study/D4604C0DE0BDFAFB4E6AA1A9AEA8DF97) (note that the table misspells as Oehberg).

Most patients reported just one adverse event, most being rated as of mild or moderate severity\n\nAgain the comparator by Davies and Read is wrong (withdrawal over placebo is 21%, not the raw 34.5%)\n\nBottom Line: This is the correct study design, still the control-for-placebo issue, and we know that paroxetine is an offender.\n\n[Fava et al. 2007](https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/10/6/835/804825): ""Effects of gradual discontinuation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in panic disorder with agoraphobia""\n\n>Tapering of antidepressant drugs was performed at the slowest possible pace (50 mg every other week for fluvoxamine and sertraline, 10 mg every other week for paroxetine, fluoxetine and citalopram, with 10 mg every other day in the last segment).\n\n9 were taking paroxetine, no more than 3 taking any other specific medication. 9/20 developed discontinuation symptoms, but that\'s also 5/9 taking paroxetine and 4/11 not taking paroxetine. There were no controls in this trial.\n\n>""All discontinuation syndromes subsided within a month in all but three patients (27%). These three patients had all been taking paroxetine and displayed alternation of worsened mood, fatigue and emotional lability with trouble sleeping, irritability and hyperactivity, meeting the DSM-IV criteria for cyclothymic disorder except for duration.""\n\nBottom line: Paroxetine bad (sense a theme?) and leaving out paroxetine, withdrawal was relatively short and milder.\n\n[Tint et al. 2008](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0269881107081550) ([PDF](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269881107081550)): "" The effect of rate of antidepressant tapering on the incidence of discontinuation symptoms: a randomised study""\n\nThey called their tapers short and longer, but that\'s 3 days vs 14 days. I\'d say very short vs. short. Again, a pretty random mix of SSRI and SNRI. No controls.\n\nBottom line: Hard to interpret. Short tapers, and no baseline to compare to.\n\n[Rosenbaum et al. 1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322398001267): ""Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor discontinuation syndrome: a randomized clinical trial""\n\nSertraline and paroxetine produced discontinuation symptoms. Fluoxetine did not, unsurprisingly given its half-life and the short interruption. Although there was an uninterrupted control group, it appears not to have been compared.\n\nBottom line: Fair. I don\'t entirely understand what happened to the controls, but I got interrupted while reading.\n\n**Read et al. 2014, 2018, and read & Williams 2018 will come later.**\n\n[Yasui-Furukori et al.](https://journals.lww.com/clinicalneuropharm/fulltext/2016/05000/Characteristics_of_Escitalopram_Discontinuation.2.aspx) 2016: ""Characteristics of Escitalopram Discontinuation Syndrome: A Preliminary Study""\n\nNo blinding, no controls, but the study itself acknowledges its limitations and just says that discontinuation reactions are common.\n\nR.C.P. 2012 is a bit of a mystery. The article links to [https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/treatments-and-wellbeing/antidepressants](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/treatments-and-wellbeing/antidepressants), which doesn\'t provide any data and isn\'t an article, [or to a book review](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA147011407&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=14658720&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=nysl_oweb&isGeoAuthType=true). 512/817, mixed antidepressants, online survey, but the data are missing.\n\nThis seems sketchy.\n\n[Zajecka et al. 1998](https://journals.lww.com/psychopharmacology/Fulltext/1998/06000/Serotonin_Reuptake_Inhibitor_Withdrawal.3.aspx): ""Safety of Abrupt Discontinuation of Fluoxetine: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study""\n\nThis one actually triggered a memory for me, specifically the memory of having read this study, which then reminded me that I\'d done a briefer version of this very journal club, because this one is damning:\n\n>""After 12 weeks of fluoxetine treatment (20 mg/day), 395 responders were abruptly randomized to placebo (N = 96) or to continued fluoxetine (N = 299)...   Reports of new or worsened adverse events were similar for both groups at each visit after randomization. Patient discontinuations related to adverse events were also similar in both groups. Mild, self-limited lightheadedness or dizziness occurred in a small percentage of patients who discontinued fluoxetine treatment but was of little clinical significance. No cluster of symptoms suggestive of a discontinuation syndrome was observed. Abrupt discontinuation of fluoxetine treatment was well tolerated and did not seem to be associated with significant clinical risk. ""\n\nSpecifically, 64/95 (67%) of patients switched to placebo reported 1 or more adverse effects over the 6 weeks of follow-up. But 223/299 (75%) who had no change made reported events. *There was no withdrawal effect observed.*\n\nBottom line: This one is a flat-out lie. Calling this 67% withdrawal is true if you don\'t read it, but it actually goes against what the paper says.\n\n[Hindmarch et al. 2000](https://journals.lww.com/intclinpsychopharm/Abstract/2000/15060/Abrupt_and_brief_discontinuation_of_antidepressant.1.aspx): ""Abrupt and brief discontinuation of antidepressant treatment: effects on cognitive function and psychomotor performance""\n\nAgain multiple different drugs, with a 4-7 day double-blind interruption with placebo. Paroxetine discontinuation caused all kinds of problems; ""these effects are not evident in patients receiving fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram, suggesting they are not an SSRI class phenomenon."" This study had equal, fairly small numbers for all four drugs.\n\n[Sir et al. 2005](https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/depression/randomized-trial-sertraline-versus-venlafaxine-xr/) ([PDF](https://www.psychiatrist.com/read-pdf/16858/)): Randomized Trial of Sertraline Versus Venlafaxine XR in Major Depression: Efficacy and Discontinuation Symptoms\n\n""A priori analyses of symptoms associated with treatment discontinuation demonstrated no difference between treatment groups. However, in post hoc analyses, sertraline was associated with less burden of moderate to severe discontinuation symptoms. "" This study had 8 weeks of double-blind treatment, followed by a 2 week taper. There was no placebo, and the taper was not blinded (because everyone had to be off the medication at the end.) This is the wrong design to assess anything except burden between sertraline and venlafaxine.\n\nRead and Davies say that the study gave 85% discontinuation symptoms, 110/129, broken down into 39/67 venlafaxine and 44/62 sertraline. That\'s possible, but I cannot find the source for any of those numbers in the article. Actually, I can\'t make any sense of the numbers at all. There were 163 subjects total, 79 and 84 on sertraline and venlafaxine, respectively. I can make no sense of the Read and Davies numerator or denominator. If anyone else can, I\'m not certain that I\'m wrong, but I can\'t figure it out.\n\n[Black et al. 1993](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-42410-001): ""The abrupt discontinuation of fluvoxamine in patients with panic disorder."" I can\'t access the article, but that loses only an n of 14.\n\nLet\'s back up now.\n\n[Read et al. 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178114000833): ""Adverse emotional and interpersonal effects reported by 1829 New Zealanders while taking antidepressants""\n\n""A google webpage advertising the study was established ([www.viewsonantidepressants.co.nz](https://www.viewsonantidepressants.co.nz)).

The study was publicized in the New Zealand media via media releases, interviews with the researchers and advertisements.""\n\nThe website is defunct. The exact questionnaire does not seem to be available.\n\nHey, while we\'re processing badly collected data, I want the good stuff!\n\n>The majority (82.8%) reported that the ADs had reduced their depression. Participants reported the following levels of depression in the year before taking ADs: severe  42.7%, moderate  37.8%, mild  11.8%, and not at all  7.6%. While taking ADs the rates were: severe  10.5%, moderate  23.1%, mild  45.2%, and not at all  21.2%. The question While taking antidepressants my quality of life was.... elicited the following response rates: greatly improved  49.2%, slightly improved  36.1%, unchanged  5.8%, slightly worse  4.4%. a lot worse  4.5%.\n\nYes, no control... and no quality control... but 82.8% is a good effect!\n\nAnyway, 1367 provided responses about discontinuation effects. Read and Davies say that 750 of those 1367 reported some. That\'s not explicitly given in the text, but 55% report withdrawal effects.\n\nMy primary complaint is that this is an online survey that has demographics not matching the country with unclear question phrasing and, the biggest issue with such things, unclear promulgation. Did this get circulated by psychiatrists? By Scientologists? There is no way to know.\n\n[Read and William 2018](https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082545820&origin=inward&txGid=6c46292757c8434f923c84ab37d28749&featureToggles=FEATURE_NEW_DOC_DETAILS_EXPORT:1): Adverse Effects of Antidepressants Reported by a Large International Cohort: Emotional Blunting, Suicidality, and Withdrawal Effects\n\nAgain I don\'t have access to the article, just the abstract. It\'s another online survey. The same concerns apply.\n\nThe assessment for severity and duration includes some different studies. I\'m not going to repeat the exercise.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\n2258/4052... but of that, 1278/2330 is by studies done by Read (2014 and 2018). If you include the missing data from the RCP survey, then 512/817 more, for 1790/3147, or 56.9% of online study respondents noting some degree of withdrawal.\n\nSubtracting those out leaves a much smaller 468/905. They\'re also methodologically so heterogeneous that I don\'t think meta-analysis works, noting again the inclusion of Zajecka et al, which in fact shows the opposite of what Davies and Read assert.\n\nA more rigorous reassessment would require redoing the statistical analysis excluding Read\'s studies, and redoing this for the other conclusions drawn. I won\'t. I\'ve run out of interest. As I have asserted, once someone starts pulling methodological skullduggery and gets caught, all of their conclusions should be discarded. The problem isn\'t that the conclusion is necessarily untrue but that it is unsound; it is, effectively, fake science rather than real science. The onus is on the writer to provide real data and analysis, not make things up. And, in this case, use other, smaller, better studies as a way to disguise large, bad studies.\n\nThe devil is in the details. I agree that systematic review and meta-analysis are the top of the evidence pyramid, but that\'s predicated on the work being done carefully and in good faith. Bad systematic review is a great way to put a level of remove between the conclusion and the bad data underlying it. Uncovering that takes effortenough effort that it\'s an effective trick. If I were in charge of the institutions of science, I would want forensic statisticians on every study and critical readers to do assessment of every meta-analysis. That\'s not achievable, but it\'s still important to catch this and promulgate the catches when possible.\n\n**tl;dr:** Include large, bad studies in meta-analysis and you can hide that you\'re weighting bad data. It\'s scientific skullduggery.'"

Moving it or keeping it still didn't seem to make a difference. The paun was so intense that I felt it in my neck, making the left side of it feel stiff. I put a heatpad on my shoulder, which did nothing, and then took an Aleve, which did very little. After an agonizing 10 hours, I took a Naproxen (had leftover pills from a back muscle spasm a year before) which helped tremendously. But the pain was so bad, I had to take off work.(Not that I could do my job anyway, lifting 40-60lb cases of alcohol)\n\nI had gone on a vacation over the weekend with my girlfriend, during the period of which I took two naproxen and two cyclobenzaprine (also from the back muscle spasm) a day to dull the pain. While there were no sharp pains (save for one morning) it was a dull ache for the entire time. This feeling continued long after into the week, and seemed to shift from my entire shoulder, to front of it, back of it, and even what felt like under the bone of my shoulder.\n\nI went to see a doctor in Urgent Care on Monday, in which I tried my best to describe the pain. After a while, they had said that I probably had Bursitis, but would need to see an orthopedist to check if it was a heart attack. (PRETTY sure it wasn't.) They gave me a sling, but I wasn't using slings, as the angle it held my arm at was quite painful to me, and still is.\n\nOn Thursday, I went to the Orthopedist. He seemed to be rushing me along, as he kept cutting me off as I was trying to expain the feeling in my arm. Nothing regarding a heart attack was further explored. During said visit, I was asked to push my arms outward against his pushing inward, and found my left arm had difficulty pushing against his, which he commented on. He came to the conclusion that I either had a pinched nerve, or I tore a tendon. He wants me to do an MRI scam to make sure.\n\nI stopped taking naproxen/cyclobenzaprine on Friday, because the pain has now dulled to occasional flashes depending on how I move or hold my arm, and said pain is bearable, for the most part. But there are muscles in my upper arm and shoulder that feel tightened no matter how much I relax, and the arm feels stiff, and cracks occasionally when moved. Moving the arm makes this feeling worse, resting it at certain angles cam either soothe or irritate it further.\n\nI have no idea what's up with my arm anymore, and the local medical center (which doesn't have a very good reputation, I should add) hasn't really helped. I'm going to talk with my primary physician and see another orthopedist for a second opinion, but I wouldn't mind a few MORE opinions."""
dicyclomine,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/nfihw9/dicyclomine_anyone_else_have_an_experience/,b'Dicyclomine - Anyone Else Have an Experience?',,"b'Three or four years ago, a doctor prescribed me Dicyclomine pills (10mg, I believe?) to help with stomach/esophagus spasms that had been causing me to vomit for a few years at that point. I believe it is considered a muscle relaxer, but I may be wrong on that. I\'m supposed to take 1 pill every 6 hours.\n\nThe medicine does a good job of helping my stomach symptoms, but I immediately realized I couldn\'t do the 4x a day dosage, as dicyclomine makes you feel ""stoned"" about 20ish minutes after you take it, and you can\'t drive like that.\n\nAfter years of experimenting, I take two before bed and it puts me right out to sleep, and I know how to use my medicine appropriately so it does what it is supposed to without fucking me over.\n\nBut I\'m on a drug board, so of course I\'ve abused this shit too. Taking two makes me feel cross faded, and if I\'ve been drinking or smoking, it makes me feel straight up drunk even if I haven\'t had much to drink/smoke. It causes a weird empty feeling in one\'s stomach and a light headedness as well.\n\nIf more is taken, it definitely becomes a dissociative and impacts memory. The few times I\'ve done more than 3-4 at once, I\'ve regretted it and remembered little, and felt a bit off the next day.\n\nCombined with acid/shrooms this shit becomes a nightmare and somehow always manages to turn the trip to a dark place, even if one can\'t feel the effects of dicyclomine really. I made the mistake of taking 2 pills in the woods on a high dose of acid and straight up thought I had lost control of my body and was ""locked in"" it. Freakiest trip I\'ve ever had.\n\nIn general, it isn\'t a fun ""high"" it seems and it can get very confusing and disorienting even with two pills. Makes me sleep like a log tho.\n\nI\'m curious if anyone else has been given dicyclomine before and if the effects have been similar? My wife has taken one pill and hated the ""feeling of it"" and refuses to do it again; my best friend tried one too, and it put him to sleep but he said he had weird dreams, so I don\'t think it\'s just a ""me"" thing.'"

azithromycin,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1v6ior/i_feel_like_my_life_has_been_wasted_in_an/,b'I feel like my life has been wasted in an inefficient schooling system',,"b""So, I'm from Quebec, and here we graduate high school at grade 11 and move on to CEGEP, and then university, or work force, after whatever 2-3 year course we took is passed. Just a little heads up.\n\nAnyway, I graduated HS in 2013, and was all preppy for CEGEP. During that time, I moved out of my childhood home, and (following my parents finalization of the divorce), I was no longer able to see my Dad on a regular basis anymore (I was given the choice between living with my mom or my dad, I chose my mom because she had anxiety issues whereas my dad, as long as I knew him at least [it's since been revealed to me that he also went through depression immediately following the divorce], he was an emotional bulwark, and rolled with the punches.)\n\nSo, I faced a couple of challenges immediately as CEGEP began. One, due to the way CEGEP works, I had last pick on classes since I was first year, so I had to pick the shitty 8AM classes nobody in their right mind wants, a full hour and a half earlier than usual in HS. That's the least of it, because I had to spend an hour a day commuting, which is a deal longer than the 15-minute walk I had to get to HS. Just a myriad of changes that made me a little anxious, nothing to serious, but these little changes compiled with the massive changes, I think.\n\nAnyway, about mid way through October, I actually contracted some pretty bad pneumonia. I went through 2 inhalers of salbutamol and, uh, something else, and 2 rounds of antibiotics, including azithromycin and Levofloxacin, stuff with just absolutely awful side effects. Honestly, I wouldn't wish pneumonia on my worst enemy, it HURTS, and its CONSTANT, the coughing literally cripples anything you can do, I was bedridden for 3 weeks, even coughing up blood every so often, this wasn't just walking pneumonia. I was a step away from chest x-rays before I finally got better. \n\nSo, I finally somewhat recover from the pneumonia, enough to go to school (I would continue coughing for at least a month or more), and I find out that I actually have a test the following day, and I don't expect to be given a break because I had pneumonia, even with a doctors note. I hadn't studied at all for three weeks, I had 100+ pages of textbook I needed to catch up on, I needed to get on it. So, of course, I did.\n\nI always knew I was a quick study. I hardly studied for anything in high school, but then, I attended every class. I think I only ever skipped a class once, and that was gym, and it was to prepare for a following class. I'm sort of a nerd, I guess. But I spent 2 hours skimming over the textbook (it was for computer science, the class was Java [heh]), and I still passed the test. The next class the teacher berated the class for not performing, but I still got a really good mark. Don't get me wrong, this isn't bragging, because I just crumpled after that test.\n\nI think at that point I was *this* close to breaking, just collapsing under the weight of all these changes. And then I realize, it takes me 2 hours to catch up on 3 weeks of classes, 16 hours of class in total. And this wasn't just me taking in information and forgetting a minute after the test, because I can still remember all the stuff about nested loops and whatever else was in the book. I literally have a gift for studying, I can study apparently 8 times faster than any normal person. Which means, I've wasted literally years of my life in this inefficient schooling system.\n\nI know it's incredibly selfish of me to even think that I should have my education catered to my special talent, but its incredibly frustrating knowing that if I were given the necessary tools to work to my full potential, I could be done my schooling by now. I hate it. I hate inefficiency. It's the one thing that pisses me off more than anything. If someone does so much as waste words, repeats things I already know, I just get so frustrated. It probably makes me incredibly intolerable to work with, but its how I am. And this realization of how much of a waste my life has been just made me fold over and cry. I don't think I returned to school a day after that, I was just so disturbed.\n\nOf course, this sent my mother off the wall, she was already anxious to, need I remind you. I couldn't be bothered to get up, I don't think I need to explain it to you. That feeling of worthlessness, that getting up and doing something is just going to make your life more miserable. And I was just wasting more time, which made me even unhappier and disgusted at myself and the world. \n\nSo my mom told me to go to a psychiatrist and I did and the psychiatrist sort of made me realize why I was depressed and sort of make me come to terms with my reality. She told me to force myself to do stuff, and I guess I begrudgingly did, and I started walking the dog and do chores for money (keep in mind this was around christmas time). Of course, I failed because I didnt return because by the time I even saw the psychiatrist for the first time the finals had already started and I didnt just magically feel better after one session or even after many sessions. Whatever. I don't want to go back there, I never want to go back there. I wish I could just teach myself, but I can't, because thats the world we live in.\n\nNow I don't know what I'm going to do, but for now, I want to not feel like absolute shit.\n\ntl;dr, life changed suddenly and massively, eventually got sick for weeks, came back, realized how I caught up weeks of studying in 2 hours, whole life sort of crashed from there."""
corticosteroid swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/DermatologyQuestions/comments/10f4h0t/im_at_my_wits_endsevere_atopic_dermatitis_eczema/,b'Im at my wits end(severe atopic dermatitis [eczema] please help)',,"b'Hey everyone,\n\nFirst time poster, long time reader. My eczema/atopic dermatitis/allergy journey has been a long and painful one, so apologies for the long post. \n\nI was first diagnosed with eczema at around 5(?) or so, pretty much right after recovering from pneumonia on antibiotics (which I think ruined my immune system and causes my issues). Pretty much ever since then, the treatment eczema has dominated my life. Its been constant use of corticosteroid creams (taromometasine, protopic, elidel etc etc). Every few months Id have a good period where I didnt really flare too badly and it seemed under control, but beginning in about 10th grade my eczema started to get so much worse. \n\nFirst it happened on my scalp, where Id get these huge lesions and scabs that I would scratch and that would weep (my mom used to comb them out and apply my ointments, bless her soul). But that eventually went away. Then it got really bad along my arm and hands to the point where it would stick to my clothes and would need to be dressed like wounds. Eventually, that cleared up. \n\nFast forward to my first year in Uni, the real start of the decline. Quickly my skin started to be at an all time low. It was flaky, dry, itchy and would clump in these huge scaled patches, and would crack, weep and bleed despite any treatment. Suddenly Covid hit toward the end of my first year and I pushed through. At the start of second year it wasnt that bad, manageable but still painful. \n\nEventually during second year it got to a point where I couldnt move, like I was physically unable to move because of how much pain I was in (not the worst sentencing during quarantine but still a defeating fate). That summer I had to drop courses that were running on campus because of my skin and the pain levels (first time Ive ever let my eczema dictate or come in the way of my academic progression). \n\nThat summer I ended up in hospital because I had no other alternative due to closures and restrictions here in Canada. The doctor prescribed my oral steroids so I would qualify for light therapy. After taking the steroids for ONE day, my pain was immediately reduced but the condition of my skin remained the same. I was then (somewhat) forced into starting UV light therapy as the doctor I saw said that I needed to do so to qualify for stronger treatment options (no hate at all). After enduring the most painful and excruciating months, light therapy was over and my skin had only gotten worse.\n\nAfter all of this my skin was still not any better, and I was started on Dupixent (dupilimab) with bi-weekly injections. At first it was amazing, my skin cleared up, I has no pain and was the happiest I had been in so longbut that didnt last for long. About four/five months on Dupixent I started to develop weird hives (grouped) and subsequently aquagenic urticaria that would show up about 5 minutes after injecting Dupixent, and would disappear an hour later. Sadly the water sensitivities and hives persisted and the Dupixent stopped working. \n\nI told my doctors and they all suggested I stop dupixent as it seemed that I was having an allergic reaction to the drug. Following this development I was started on Rinvoq (the immunosuppressant) which, again, worked wonders at first. Now, Im still on Rinvoq (about 6 months in and in my fourth year) and although my eczema is much better than it was, I still get constant flareups (WEEKLY) that are more similar to allergic reactions (swollen, hot, hive, bumpy, painful, itchy large patches on my face, neck, back, arms and shoulders). The Rinvoq helps overall but these flareups are fucking unbearable, and it doesnt even seem like eczema anymore. I still use protopic to manage these flares as well as ice packs, ice masks, cold rollers and fans to bring down the swelling. The only moisturizer that works for me is vaseline which I use everyday, 3 times a day. \n\n[EXTRA] - Ive gone through allergy testing (nothing out of the ordinary and have removed anything associated), have dieted and cut out potential dietary triggers (i.e., dairy, hazelnut, red meat, etc), I only use NATURAL (no sulphates, alcohol, etc) soaps and detergents, and I take lukewarm (not cold or hot) showers. I dont smoke weed or drink at all, only take my Vyvanse (40mg daily) and vape. \n\nMy doctors are lovely and have been such a big help, as have my family, girlfriend and friends, but I cant keep living like this and just dreading doing anything that might effect and make my skin any more worse than it constantly is. I just feel like such a burden to those most involved in my life and my journey, and just want for this to end so that I can get back to being helpful, doing the things that I love and finding some peace. \n\nAnyways, thanks for listeningIm not expecting a cure-all treatment or method, even pity or shame. All I wanna know is if there is anyone else who has/had similar symptoms, what they are doing/did and if theres anything else I can try. Thanks. \n\n[pics available if yall want] \n\n- Oct :)'"

No one knows what is wrong with me, how to diagnose me or how to treat me. But they all agree something is very wrong. Originally they thought Lupus and then the ER said vasculitis.

I've had pain around the UR 2 tooth since May 2018 and I'm desperate for help! I do appreciate that these things can be difficult to diagnose. At present I'm in daily pain and have a gap in my front teeth, both of which are awful, so I would be really grateful for any help you can give me.\n\nThe background is as follows:\n\n\\- I'm aged 62 - no fluoride toothpaste when I was young, so a fair bit of restoration in my mouth, but I follow rigorous cleaning regime and regularly visit dentist / hygienist - last visit I was congratulated on absence of plaque\n\n\\- UR2 had some pain in 2017 and was diagnosed as having a calcifying root; pain went away, but came back worse this year, so endodontist did root canal on May 16th 2018\n\n\\- RCT did not stop pain, so eventually UR2 was extracted on July 31st 2018 with a view to having a Maryland bridge\n\n\\- Pain receded a bit and bridge was fitted on August 14th 2018, attached to UR3\n\n\\- Bridge seemed to be making the pain worse, particularly as the jointing material made the UR3 the only point of contact between the upper and lower teeth (dentist told me there was no alternative and that the bridge had to be like that)\n\n\\- Pain worsened, so after a month the bridge was removed on Sept 18th 2018\n\n\\- I'm still getting intermittent pain nearly everyday - I get about 1-2 days a week when the pain is hardly noticeable when taking painkillers, then 2 days with bad spells of pain: 9-10 /10 (dentist asked me to keep a pain diary) - and some days with just a mild to medium ache; when the pain is bad my right cheek swells and goes red\n\n\\- I've been taking 400mg ibuprofen + 1000mg paracetamol 3 times a day and my doctor prescribed amitriptyline to help me sleep - I'm desperate to stop taking the pain killers as I've now been on them since May\n\n\\- I would like to have an implant, particularly as going around with a gap in my front teeth is awful for me, but this can't be done until the pain has been sorted\n\n\\- I've seen 2 endodontists so far - initially I was told that the pain could be just reaction to all the dental work, but it is still going on; the one I saw last week said that there might be a small fragment of bone or root left in the UR2 socket / possibly some infection there and recommended apicoectomy of UR2 root area; however, today, when I tried chewing on the right side the pain came on very badly and appeared to be mainly further back than the UR2. I called the endodontist and spoke to their nurse, but no reply. Would a problem with the UR2 socket area cause a problem like this?\n\nI've attached the latest x-ray of the UR2, 3 + 4 area - I'll post the one of the UR3, 4 + 5 in another post in a moment. I have more x-rays going back to before the extraction, so if it would help to see those, or if you have any questions at all, please let me know.\n\nI would be extremely grateful if anyone could tell me if they can see anything in the x-rays at all (UR4 has an old root canal) or if they can help with any other suggestions.\n\nMany thanks!"""

I realize it, I have suspected it, kinda for awhile, but i\'m kinda freaking out now, like I can\'t think about anything else. I have used some drugs recently trying to self medicate my issues, and I don\'t think that was a good idea. I have to wait 3 weeks to see a Psychiatrist, and honestly, I think that is going to be too late. It\'s going to be basically midterm, by then. I can\'t get through an 18 problem math assignment without spending close to 6 hours on it. Mostly because I just zone out, which by the way, should only take 1-2 hours. I\'m afraid if I wait any longer, it\'s essentially college suicide. I\'m going to fail, and if I get two more D\'s in my transcript, (The first two were in calc, and an engineering class, because I simply could not stay awake, engage in the class, nor study properly because I just zone out) my school boots me out the program. I have no professional help, I have tried everything I could possibly do for years, drugs being the last resort. I can\'t tell the people at work to fuck off, The worry from the anxiety throughout the year makes me so physically ill, terrible indigestion, ridiculous hot flashes, I get these moments where i\'m shaking, and it feels like my blood sugar level just hit zero, and I feel like passing out, and my roommate is leeching off the way I am. \n\n**What the fuck can I do..**\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHello /r/Depression! I am am currently in the middle of a mental and physical breakdown, after calls to my mother, and a few doctors, and an appointment with a Psychiatrist, I think I am ready to accept that I: \n\n* Have some sort of **Mental** Issue(s)\n* Living life incredibly unrealistic, and have been for awhile.\n* Am more afraid for my College career then my health, in the sense of using drugs, such as [Cyclobenzapr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclobenzaprine), [Ambien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zolpidem), [Adderall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall), [Modafinil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil). \n\n* I also want to note that, I don\'t think at this point I would have a reason to lie, and I hope you keep that in mind. I have to say this because I just can\'t continue without, I will explain this later. \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIt all started about a week or two ago. I decided enough is enough, and i\'m going to make an appointment with my University\'s medical clinic. I have for what I would believe to be my entire life, but most notably, during high school, during my first 3 years of college, and now the start of my fourth year, have had severe **Sleep Issues**. I have for the longest time believed due to so many different factors that I have some sort of sleeping issue, be it some sort of insomnia, or some circadian rhythm problem, who knows, I don\'t. Alongside this issue, I would also dare claim to have some sort of **Obsessive or impulsive issue**. I went in and explained to the best of my ability, which is not very great out loud, sounds much better in my head, how I was feeling, and what my issues are. Doctor took some blood samples, and prescribed ambien, and recommended melatonin, and kicked me out the door. Fast forward to the following Monday, my 5 day trial of ambien was going to begin, and I was not looking forward to it.\n\n * I have for nearly all my life, excluding the last 3 months, have had an obsessive dislike for drugs or alcohol. Without explaining my entire life story, I believe to be due to the way I was raised, is why I felt so. \n\nIt was explained that if I have some sort of insomnia, that I need to correct the issue by creating a new and strict sleeping schedule, and the Ambien is going to help me do that, I very poorly tried to explain that not only have I done this, \n\n* for I conducted my very own sleep experiment for nearly two years straight once with my phone once on my sleeping patterns. I can accept that my data probably wasn\'t that accurate, and I was limited to the capabilities of my phone, thought I would say I collected enough data to say that I just don\'t sleep well, at all, no matter how hard I try, no matter what tactics I use.\n* I have tried to many different sleep hygiene, habits ect. I cut out all blue light from electronics, use breathing techniques.. list goes on. \n\nI reluctantly accepted because I very much want to succeed at school, and at the time, was at the point to do anything to function properly in my day to day. I was very much convinced that if I solve my sleep issue, I will have my energy pack, my focus and concentration, my motivation. \n\nAmbien is absolute shit, and I will never take sleeping pills again. The first night after taking it was ok. Took the pill laid down, and then just woke up the next day. Literally how it felt, didn\'t remember falling asleep at all, which at the time blew my mind. I\'m like holy crap I didn\'t toss and turn for 7-8 hours straight, this might be it! *nope* The second thing that went through my mind was that, wow I don\'t feel good at all, i\'m completely drained of energy per usual, but i\'m really foggy, like drunk inebriation. Figured the CNS from the pills were still active, and they would wear off soon. *nope* Felt like shit all day, my functionality was even worst. Second night, took the pill and tried to read my physics book till I fell asleep, I remember getting really tired and closed the book and closed my eyes. Woke up the next day, felt about the same as yesterday, i\'m convinced at this point that I\'m not actually sleeping, that i\'m just not remembering being awake the entire night. Third night, same. Fourth night, this was the worst night so far, I work at mcdonalds, and I was trying to function at that job while feeling like a drunk idiot. I\'m really positive that all my coworkers think i\'m some sort of druggy now as well. After that I decided I would not take the last pill. Fast forward to that saturday night, my amazing job, schedules me to work till 1am fridays, then open at 6am sundays. Which means with my ever imposing sleep issues, i\'m sabotaged by work. I was feeling a bit desperate at this point as, i\'m really behind in my studies, and figured okay, get some good rest tonight, have some energy for work, then hit the books hard sunday night. WELL, up to this point in my life, I don\'t think I have had a more fucked night. I was trying to finish some calculus homework, around 7pm, took the pill around 7:30. Figured when that really sleepy feeling hits me like it did the other night I would lay down, well I don\'t remember anything after 7ish. I just woke up in my bed the next morning to my alarm, this **scared** me so fucking much. So yeah that\'s my experience with my doctors so far, fast forward a week, and I have my test results. I\'m Vitamin D Deficient, my doctor thought this was great news and prescribed me 50000 units of D3 and kicked me out the door. Being who I am, didn\'t say really a single word during this check up, and just accepted my fate. This was really frustrating as I didn\'t care about being Vitamin D Deficient, though it\'s nice to be fixing the issue I guess, but the treatment is one pill a week, for 7 weeks. I\'m kinda freaking out at this point because my energy or sleeping issue has just been forgotten I guess, and i\'m back to square one, and have even less options now, as my professional help, isn\'t really helping.\n\n* I decided to call my mother, and tell her the truth. She calls every now and then, or I\'ll call her sometimes, but I always tell her everything is fine. It\'s fucking not. I\'m miserable, I can\'t sleep, I can\'t think, I can\'t study, I have no concentration. We get really into it, and she suggest seeing a Psychiatrist. We kinda talked about it, and she made a case that I was depressed. Well sure i\'m depressed, i\'m studying Chemical Engineering, working 20 hours a week, and not sleeping, at all. I\'m constantly surrounded my the what I would claim to be some of the biggest and brightest minds in my school. These engineers are smart as hell, and it\'s just a constant battle for me to stick with it. I struggle so fucking much with my studies, but I stick with it, because if i\'m going to study something, it better be the hardest, highest paying degree right! *This is an issue i\'ll talk about later.* \n\nThis idea that i\'m depressed has got me really messed up. I started googling depression, and symptoms. First thing I see, hard to sleep, *uh yeah*, can\'t focus / lack of motivation, *yep that one.* List goes on, I have all these problems, but thinking about it rationally, I have it pretty good. I have a car, my own apartment, as supportive as they can be I guess, family. I\'m a first gen student, my parents didn\'t even get HS diplomas, and there poor as fuck. Why am I depressed? It has to be because I don\'t sleep well enough, or because I don\'t have enough energy to address all these stressors I have. Then I get to **really** thinking about the issues I have. \n* Why don\'t you sleep? I can\'t turn off at night, my thoughts are just all over the place, every night, this, that. Sometimes it\'s about important things, sometimes it\'s just some saying or a song i\'ll just repeat ad nauseum. If I could just *fall asleep*, i\'d be fine, but rarely get that, I\'m exhausted every day, and even though i\'m tired as fuck, I can\'t fall asleep. Okay, this is something I guess.\n\n* So my energy problem, why can\'t I engage in class like others, why can\'t I focus on my studies, why am I constantly just off task. Well maybe if you got some sleep you could focus, and have the energy to do some work. Yeah well I have always had an issue here. Half the time i\'m reading something, i\'ll just reread the entire paragraph again, and again, hoping that I actually can make sense of it. I find myself doing this with math constantly, reread problem, reread problem, reread problem, oh maybe I should try solving it.. not reading the problem over and over. Then there is this issue, when i\'m reading something or focusing on something, at some point I just drift off in thought. As if some movie had just been turned on and I just tuned into it, and a reel of ideas or thoughts will just start playing, all the while, i\'m still fucking reading or what not. Now I have to reread the last whole page because I didn\'t pay attention to any of it. \n\nThis has got to be some sort of non physical issue, and it\'s I can\'t believe it myself. \n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\nSo if you\'re still reading at this point, holy hell. Okay! \n\nThis next part is going to be a deep analysis of myself that I have slightly brushed over many times before, and I have never explained this to anyone. This is going to be a deep part of myself, that coming to terms with makes me feel crazy. I feel crazy because it feels normal for me to think and act this way. \n\nNo matter who I am with, or where I am, I have this reoccurring idea that I\'m being judged, scrutinized, you name it. I **NEED** to be acting in such a way that is going to make me appear the best for whomever is watching. I **HAVE** to be this perfect example. If you somehow were able to ask any of my friends, family, old bosses, coworkers. I bet they would all say along the same lines, Yeah many_problem_no_time is one of the hardest workers, or is really kind, almost fictitiously nice. *Nope it\'s sincere.* For some reason, (and I feel like it\'s my favorite part about myself, thought looking at if from a different perspective, is not really healthy) I need to be this perfect example of a hard worker, or I need to be a perfect example on how someone should treat others, or I need to always say the nicest, or positive thing to someone or about something.  Yeah that doesn\'t sound bad, except the fact that my friends have been walking all over me, and using me my entire life. My coworkers and bosses, exploit the fact that I honestly can\'t say no to covering someone\'s shift or staying later to help out, even though I know I can\'t because I have an exam tomorrow and why am I still fucking typing.. I just can\'t and this is to address all the points above that I said I would explain. I just can\'t see the bad side of most things, ""Yeah this sucks, but I can take it"", ""It can only be worst"", ""I can\'t let this person think ill of me, I have to help him no matter what!"" These are constant things I find myself saying to myself, maybe not exactly like that, but in a quick thought process. Everything has to be the bright side, it will always be worst, ect. **BUT** thinking this way, and doing these things make people happy, or ease whatever may be bothering them, and *I love that.* It\'s like i\'m addicted to pleasing people, and it feels great when I can, but the expense.. I go to such ridiculous lengths to help people sometimes, that even I don\'t understand why i\'m doing it, I just do it. It pains me, to my soul to admit this, and it would not be good for him to find out I don\'t think, but my relationship with my best friend, is more of what would be described as an abusive relationship. All through our childhood, I knew I was being used. My simple presence got him off the hook for so many things, church sundays, daily chores, eating more unhealthy foods, ect. I fucking know dude, i\'m not some blind idiot, I just can\'t stop myself. I was making his life easier, or something, and I got to impress his family, **A LOT**, oh my manners, oh many_problem_no_time your manners are exceptional, no one your age is this nice, ect. Maybe it\'s all a facade, but I honestly don\'t know how else I would of reacted in those moments, my very first instinct, is to act as nice, and with as much **EMPATHY** as I can muster. God the empathy, I feel so bad for so many people, I just want to help, by being that one person that says something nice, or just treats you with respect.\n\nExcept I have so much fucking anxiety when it comes to talking to people.\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAll that love, or generosity, just gets bottled up into a what if game in my head, where I get carried away in these self arguments about if I said this, they might respond this way, but wait, what if this makes them mad, sad, ect. I CANNOT have someone think ill of me, it\'s best I don\'t say anything.. Growing up, I had very few friends, I stayed mostly in the depths of my own thoughts, people can\'t think ill of you if they don\'t even know what you sound like.. This is honestly a rational I have used many times in the past. People can\'t hate you if you just stay invisible. In all my years of schooling, which at this point is pretty high, I rarely ever spoke in class, oh i\'m confused on a topic, fuck if i\'m going to make that know. People will think i\'m some sort of idiot.  ""I can\'t ask a question, it\'s going to take up class time, and people will hate me for being that guy."" God is this hard to deal with in math heavy studies, if I don\'t understand I just accept it and move on. Just to make it clear, i\'m a studying Chemical Engineering, and I struggle with simple algebra sometimes, let alone the calculus, trigonometry, geometry, stoichiometry.. \n\n\n\nThe act of doing what I think is right, to an obsessive point, alongside such massive anxiety to dealing with people and things in life, alongside the fact that **I** have to be perfect. Has all around shaped me to be who I am, and I think that i\'m a pretty cool person, and because i\'m looking at all this from a judgmental point of view, I would like to think that many people are really fortunate to know me or have a relation with me because that means with absolute certainty that I have gone out of my way to help you, mostly because I can\'t help it. (My roommate is 3 months delinquent on his bills, and owes me over $500, and I can\'t bring it up because I know money is tight, even though one point during the summer, I nearly starved everyday, to the point of looking into food banks)\n\nSO YES, i\'m fucking depressed. I\'m living some fantasy where I can only help others and not myself. Thus, is why last week I called a doctor for some help, and why i\'m having this mental breakdown. I\'m some fucking crazy person, with some obsessive issue about other people, and not giving a flying fuck about myself, which is why I have gone so long without telling anyone about this sides of myself.   Which is why I think the fact that I never, ever, even now will consider self harm an issue, because if I did, I might have recognized I had a fucking issue. Normal people do not think like this, or act this way. I have to have some sort of issue, and i\'m getting upset admitting it.. \n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nStay strong out there guys.\n\n \n\n\n'"

They prescribed me some antibiotics, Amoxicillin in particular. I have noticed that ever since I started these stupid things, that I've had a MAJOR spike in anxiety. Like, bad major spike. Hands shaking (they always do a little, but gets significantly worse when I'm nervous/anxious), super hard to focus, pounding heartbeat, feeling like I'm extremely on edge, irritable, racing thoughts. Really the whole, super fun shebang. I am so anxious most of the time that I feel like I want to crawl out of my own skin.

I cannot for the life of me figure it out. Ill make it as short as I can. \n   \n   Im a 35 y/o male and I have Crohns Disease. I have it bad. Ive had 3 bowel surgeries, Ill have an ileostomy the rest of my life. Ive had a fischer, Ive had a large pocket of infection sliced open while I was awake, Ive dealt with a year long battle with a stricture...this is where your bowels get blocked...Ive had and healed 6 sub cutaneous fistulas (open holes on your belly that tunnel from your intestines and make an open hole on your belly) One surgery I was 61 and weighed 93 lbs (due to medical mismanagement) on and on and on. \n    \n   I do not posses the vocabulary for the amount pain and sorrow Ive been through. Ive been on very high doses of Prednisone not for days or months...but years. Twice...Ive been put on the strongest pain medicines know to man for years...and then gotten off of them. \n     \n   The last two years I dealt with another stricture which yielded over 20 extremely traumatic messy ER visits. A full grown man screaming for mercy in pain. Nurses/Doctors running down hallways to push med in to get me out of pain. I ended up having a surgery a year ago to remove the stricture...it went well. \n    \n   It was time to get off the pain meds three weeks later and day three, I crashed. The vomiting was so bad it split my incision. My PCP basically told me to go pound sand...he wouldnt talk to me personally and trotted out some nurse to basically tell me day 3 was the worst and to suck it up. I went to the ER...they billed me as a drug seeker as well. They gave me no attention for 6 hours. I begged them for a CT scan. The radiologist saw the split. The doctor rushed into my room after 6 hours in agony...didnt apologize and pushed a pain med finally. I forcefully demanded she contact my surgeon in a nearby big city. He found out what was going on and immediately had me taken by medcu to his hospital where they squared me away. He was pissed. \n   \n   Fast forward a year later to present day. I have faithfully tapered off of Ketamine, Dilaudid and Fent patches...and Im down to 12mg of Oxycodone per day. \n   \n   In my state 4 years ago I was named Crohns and Colitis Man of The Year for my fundraising efforts and for counseling other folks in the same boat. In my whole city Im the guy people come to for Crohns and Colitis help. That means the world to me. \n   \n  Im getting near the end of my taper like I said...and my anxiety is through the roof. Ive been using medical pot for help and its been a big help. Unfortunately, I overdid it and used edibles and got Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. Three absolutely terrifying ER trips two weeks ago. I have ceased all pot use for the time being naturally.\n   \n   I have a certified PTSD counselor Ive met with once per week for the last two years, I juice, I have a thriving yoga practice, I drink 3 bottles of Essentia every day, I meditate through headspace every day, I use my Apple Watch for bio feedback, I quit coffee and alcohol, I take at least two baths per day and I walk at least three miles per day and I eat primarily nutrient dense food. I have arguably the greatest wife of all time and a beast of a Father who has been there for it all and never wavered. \n   \n   I am processing all of this as I come off the drugs. I cry multiple times per day. Not even ashamed. Its how I get all this shit out and heal. \n   \n   The local ER and my new PCP will RX me everything under the sun but a rescue med.(A real one) I told my doctor about how some nights Im pacing my house for literally hours. Ive got Clonidine, Baclofen and Bispurone(Too afraid to take)\n   \n   I am getting my head kicked in every single day by major panic attacks. And I totally understand there is a major crackdown in my state on Benzos. Despite all of this...I am still crawling forward. Im winning. Full on survival mode. It sounds arrogant and I am not an arrogant guy...but I am a fucking savage. I have been dealt some very unfortunate cards...this thing has almost killed me twice...its terrifying...it is absolutely terrifying. It might take me a minute sometimes...or a couple of days...but eventually...I stand up...I spit it in its fucking face and keep crawling forward. Its not pretty...its not heroic its fucking war. And Ive gotten to know a side of itself most people will not. And thats pretty damn cool. Steal sharpens steal. Im also, letting Christ back into my life...slowly(Really hard but worth it) I am so proud of myself.\n\nBut somebody please...help me understand...why a guy like me cant get 5 Ativan for a month for a rescue med. Give me one single pill, so I can stare at it...and at least know I could end my suffering if I wanted. Theres power in that, at least for me. A few pills for when I lock up in a panic attack that lasts for more then an hour I do not think is an unreasonable request. \n\nBut they make me feel like Im dirty or something or like Im a drug seeker. They are so good at it, its like its part of their fucking training. I know whats coming and no matter what I say I get schooled. And they make me feel like a drug seeker for asking. Dont want you to get addicted. \n\nBullshit.\n\nThese are the same cats that were filling 100 Oxycodone/Ativan with one phone call from me just a few years ago. No questions asked. There aint nobody that understands and respects these meds more then me. \n\nI have my own nutritionist watching over what I eat...I just got the local college strength coach on my pay roll...and I meet with them once a month...and I am dead serious.\n\nDespite all this...I am on the verge of getting myself out of this (with a lot of help)...its not even a hole anymore...Ive drilled through bedrock...and Im literally about to pull myself out of it and win. Again. \n\nI know people that get 10 to go on vacation for flights?\n\nI know this all sounded arrogant, I humbly bow my head and take my hat off to everyone dealing with this. Totally not trying to out suffer anyone. A panic attack is a panic attack. We all suffer....Im just wound up. \n\nBut is there something in my chart? Does the DEA own these guys as much as I think they do? Anyone else running into this?'"

Along with this, my attention has been getting progressively worse and an increased dose of Adderall has not helped. I have become a complete recluse and am unable to attend many classes due to the fatigue. When attending classes, I am extremely confused by material that would previously not be a challenge. This occurs mostly in language classes (I am an Asian studies major which included learning Chinese). \n\nRecently, i have started to hear sirens out of nowhere (like an ambulance or cop car) as well as feeling things touching my skin that are not there. Im not sure if this is related to the fatigue or something else. Side note: I have been having an issue with ants in my apartment so anxiety from that could be related to the physical sensation. \n\nI am on medications for ADHD (Adderall), anxiety and depression (celexa and welbutrin), and chronic migraines (verapamil). I have been on all of these medications for years without needing adjustments besides slight variations of dosage. Since being on these meds, none of my diagnosiss have been an issue besides the occasional (normal) flare up. \n\nI did go to my doctor about this and they attributed it to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome but said that they want to look into this further because it may be something else. Within the past month, I got extensive bloodwork done and all of my levels are perfect. My doctor said to me You are so healthy that it doesnt make sense for you to feel this terrible. My weight is normal for my height and Ive tried multiple different elimination diets. Personally, I do feel that there is something else going on and I havent figured it out yet. \n\nWith each passing day Ive grown more and more hopeless and I can feel myself deteriorating mentally. Things I used to be able to do, like basic chores, are near impossible to complete and I dont know how much longer I can take it. I know not to take anything said as complete fact, I just want some possible options to look into specialists and get testing done. \n\nThank you so much\n\nEDIT: I thought it would be important to add that I do not use any form of drug or alcohol'"

No euphoria, no lightheadedness, no sleepy/cuddliness afterwards. I can abstain for 3 days and then masturbate and after climax I can be reading the news 2 seconds later. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately this last side effect has bothered me the most. I have noticed my libido has crashed, not perhaps directly related to the medication, but secondarily because I get no dopamine/endorphin response from climax and sex seems less appealing. Additionally when having sex the combination of 50% less sensitivity, no pleasure during climax, condom, and sometimes a little bit of Viagra contribute to me feeling practically nothing during sex. Might as well have a wooden strap on dildo attached to me. I was prescribed Wellbutrin but am hesitant because it seems like Wellbutrin can really make anxiety worse in some instances as well as messing with more neurochemicals than I already am(SSRI=serotonin,Gabapentin I take=GABA, Wellbutrin=Norepinephrine and Dopamine).

I thought my doctor screened me at every blood test. Im also not sexually active outside of relationships but I had an ex (10 years ago) who REALLY wasnt honest and I got a pretty weird sore throat that made my tonsils touch while dating her, responded to cefixime, not to zpack, my mom took me to hospital and they thought I had mono and shot me with steroids. Which made me WORSE. I told them no way cuz antibiotics were working. Turns out I didnt have mono (did have igg for ebv though) after the steroids I had a peeling hand rash like blisters and really bad mouth pain that I assumed was a side effect of IV methyl prednisone. When I saw my PCP after he said Its not mono we checked you for everything its probably a virus to which I also disagreed but I was 22 at the time. Also when he said everything, I thought he meant stds too. It took me a while to feel better/tonsils to go down.  \n\nSo now ten years later, I freaked about the symptoms I had back then(hand rash, mouth pain, sore throat, and I had dry flaky skin around genitalia and a raised round rash/welt on side of scrotum at the time that I thought was eczema or jock itch) and ran to an ID doctor cuz I thought it could have been syphilis. He did full panel negative for all STIs twice just to make sure  (didnt test for herpes) Including FTA ABS, then he did a TPPA I had two rpr and also two reverse screens (one from labcorp one from quest) all now (ten years later, not back then) that Im worried are pulling false negatives due to length of time/waning antibodies and the fact that I basically was drinking heavily out of anxiety during those months October to December. Im talking like four or five drinks a day sometimes (I would stop a day or two before the tests, but I drank whiskey the day before the FTA ABS test) Im worried the antigen specific antibodies went down. ID doctor wouldnt treat me unless I came back positive.\n\nSwitched PCPs, this one heard me out a little better and prescribed me doxy 100mg x 2 for 28 days because he could see I was visibly worried. (No penicillin allergy but he didnt want to give me the shot yet since I keep testing negative and maybe it is something else) so I cut the drinking out since I started the doxy (I had like one beer that I split in half, and another day I had a little glass of sake but Im abstaining for the doxy to really work)\nHe did urine culture and dipstick test both normal.

I hope god forbid the doxy would be enough to stop further damage. \n\nIf not that, then maybe some other bacterial infection that wasnt treated right. Or Covid/Covid shot side effects.\n\nCould the alcohol really have messed my std tests up/ should I retest after the doxy/a month of not drinking\n\nCan anyone recommend any other tests or something else to look into.

For reference, I\'m using [this pain scale](https://cdn.paindoctor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pain-scales.png). \n\nThis is a stinging pain centered just above the meatus, which becomes sensitive to touch. There is a constant baseline pain which spikes momentarily (usually only a few seconds) by 1-2 points on the scale whenever the area is physically disturbed. There is no redness, swelling, heat to touch, or fever. This follows a fluctuating but similar pattern every time:  \n\n\n* Baseline pain starts at 0 and ramps up over time. This can last hours or days.\n* As the baseline increases, the area that can cause pain spikes increases. At its worst, eating and speaking causes pain spikes as the jaw muscles pull at the ear.\n* Baseline plateaus, usually around a 4, making sleep incredibly difficult but I can manage with most daily tasks. Sometimes goes up to a 5, rarely a 6. This can last for hours or days.\n* Baseline spikes, usually to 6 or 7. I\'ve had a few 8s and precisely two 9s where I could not move or speak until it passed. This is usually only for a few minutes, but has been upwards of an hour a couple of times.\n* The pain ""pops"" (on one 9 there was an audible click) and all pain and sensitivity to touch subsides within the next couple of minutes. All is well again.\n* No pain mitigation (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, codeine, heat, cold) has ever helped.  \n\n\nThis only happens with my right ear, has never happened with the left. There doesn\'t appear to be any pattern around its occurrence. I sleep primarily on my left side.

But I want to come to that appt prepared with questions about what could have happened and ask about specific tests he could do. \n\nWith that in mind, here are the other things I deal with:\n- body pain (all over but worst in lower back/hips, feet, knees, shoulders, wrists, neck and jaw/face)\n- raynauds\n- fatigue and sleepiness\n- unexplained periods of mouth sores\n- vision issues \n- digestive issues - I go through cycles of diarrhea and constipation. \n- periods of idiopathic hives \n- long, heavy periods with short menstrual cycles + mid cycle spotting \n- ice pick headaches/migraines\n- hair loss\n- eczema \n- beaus lines (mostly on thumbs but have been on other fingers as well)\n- trouble regulating body temperature \n- random flushing (all over but very prominent on neck and face) \n- periods of frequent postural headaches \n- I kept feeling like I had vertigo the week before this all kicked off, and its a feeling Ive had before but not as intensely \n\nI do not have a GP who would have presumably followed up after something like this. Thats why I am very motivated to get some answers from my rheumatologist. \n\nWhat do the medical professionals of Reddit make of this? What should I be asking about? \n\ncould the WBC have come down with antibiotics by accident? Or does there definitely have to be an infection for that to happen? \n\nAlso, is it even possible for there to have been a mild infection and then an autoimmune condition caused my body to freak out and make too many white blood cells? \n\nFinally, I spoke with a virtual care doc today who couldnt really answer my questions but did give me a rec for CBC & CRP to check up on WBC. \n\nThank you in advance for your thoughtful responses '"

Lack of gainful employment and academic failure.\n\nIt took a few months, but I was able to find at least two psychiatrists in my area that take my insurance. After scheduling an appointment and waiting for about a month and a half, I finally saw this new doctor. She seemed pretty nice and was empathetic. I explain to her my problems with focusing on anything, completing tasks, and my lack of an attention span. I told her that I\'ve had performance problems at jobs due to a combination of forgetfulness and an inability to stay productive, and how this has also affected me in school, how I can\'t sit still in class or how I drift off during lectures. She asked about any prior treatment, and I responded with how in childhood I was diagnosed ADHD due to hyperactivity and was prescribed Ritalin from about 4 years old until I was 10 (My family has a distrust of medication so they took me off of it) and how I was unmedicated since. My other issues include an inability to really concentrate on anything for prolonged periods of time, even leisurely activities. I can\'t sit still and watch movies or shows without getting bored and my attention span for reading is also poor. I can\'t commit to any hobbies or interests because of this.\n\nShe then asked about depression and I told her that my current situation in life has made me feel depressed (no job, no friends, poor family, etc). After all was said and done, she said that I have ""a mood disorder"" and prescribed Lamictal/Lamotrigine. I\'ve never heard of this drug being used to treat ADHD. I get home and do a bit of research online and discover that it\'s an anticonvulsant typically used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. I\'m confused, because I\'m pretty sure I\'m not bipolar. I don\'t have mood swings, nor do I have manic phases where I have high amounts of energy followed by intense lows. I suffer from depression, but that\'s due to circumstances within my life and not because of an emotional imbalance in my brain. I\'m on day 2 of taking the medication and I do not notice any changes in my focus at all.\n\nI have another appointment with another psychiatrist coming up soon. Should I get a second opinion? Or should I continue with the current treatment?'"

atenolol,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/wgc5u9/medications_for_anxiety/,b'Medications for Anxiety',,"b' 7 Popular Medication Classes For Anxiety, Explained By an RN\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Selective_Serotonin_Reuptake_Inhibitors_SSRIs)\n* [Azapirones](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Azapirones)\n* [Antihistamines](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Antihistamines)\n* [Benzodiazepines](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Benzodiazepines)\n* [Beta Blockers](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Beta_Blockers)\n* [Tricyclic Antidepressant | TCAs](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Tricyclic_Antidepressant_TCAs)\n* [Antipsychotics](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Antipsychotics)\n* [Medication Log PDF](https://twoforsue.com/medications-for-anxiety/#Free_Medication_Log_PDF)\n\n## Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs\n\n**citalopram, celexa, escitalopram, lexapro, fluoxetine, prozac, sarafem, symbyax, fluvoxamine, luvox, luvox CR, paroxetine, paxil, paxil CR, pexeva, sertraline, zoloft, vilazodone, viibryd**\n\nDrug class\n\nThis is a very common drug class; prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, migraines, panic attacks, eating disorders, PTSD, OCD, and even chronic pain.\n\n**Over 10% of the US** takes an SSRI\n\nWhat Do SSRIs Do?\n\nWhat does **every** medication within this class have in common? They all increase the level of Serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. When you take a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, youre blocking the neurons from *reabsorbing* Serotonin, meaning there is **more Serotonin** available.\n\nSince this medication increases serotonin levels, youll have more of it to regulate your mood and symptoms of anxiety. Your brain also has to adapt to more Serotonin. Its thought that by your brain having to restructure from an increase in serotonin, it becomes more able to remodel and better able to adapt to stressors like anxiety.\n\nSo what does Serotonin do? Well, A LOT. Serotonin influences our mood and emotional state, our digestion, appetite, and our sleep cycle. It is found in your brain, in your intestines and even in your blood. One could argue that it impacts everything.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nSerotonin is even in animals, plants and fungus. We can measure the levels in our blood, but we cant measure the levels within our brain. Meaning were all in the dark as to how much we have in our brain.\n\n## Azapirones\n\n**Buspar Buspirone**\n\nDrug Class\n\nBuspirone is in the drug class of Azapirones. There is no addiction risk, overall there are less side effects than many other anxiolytic medicines. It can take up to a month for the medication to work fully. Typically prescribed for *generalized* anxiety.\n\nWhat Does It Do?\n\nThis drug class impacts serotonin and dopamine receptors. The full mechanism of the drug arent known actually. But, because it seems to take 2-4 weeks to make a difference, that would mean it likely has to do with the receptors for serotonin and dopamine.\n\nIt is thought that by the receptors adjusting, it can make them more adaptive and therefore *better able* to handle stress. Another possibility is that by blocking serotonin receptors, an increase of serotonin is available, which improves symptoms for some types of anxiety disorders.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe drug Buspar was originally developed for schizophrenia, but wasnt useful. It did however seem to help people with anxiety. Dizziness seems to be one of the most common complaints as far as side effects.\n\n## Antihistamines\n\n**brompheniramine, dimetane, benadryl, diphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clistin, clemastine, tavist, doxylamine, unisom, hydroxyzine, atarax, vistaril, promethazine, phenergan, triprolidine, triafed**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used for allergies but also used for anxiety. Antihistamines are divided into different generations & target different histamine receptors in our body.\n\n* H1 Receptors: Found Throughout the Body\n* H2 Receptors: Mostly Stomach Acid Secretion\n* H3 Receptors: Central Nervous System\n* H4 Receptors: Still Being Researched\n\nWhat Do Antihistamines Do?\n\nWere actually still learning a lot about histamines but what we do know is that**anti-**histamines are usually anticholinergic;**blocking** receptors for choline.\n\n**Vistaril, hydroxyzine and Atarax** are commonly prescribed for anxiety.\n\nWhile your risks with this drug class are much less severe than when taking benzodiazepines, these are first generation antihistamines. Therefore, they do have a sedating effect (precisely why they can relieve tension) but this also means they can impair our ability to remember, think and learn. Especially the first generation antihistamines that easily penetrate our brain.\n\nAn example of **second** generation antihistamines are Claritin & Zyrtec. Unlike first generation antihistamines, these do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. Therefore, they relieve many effects of allergies, but do not have as many sedating properties or memory impairments associated with them. When it comes to anxiety though, Claritin & Zyrtec wont do you much good.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe only drug within this class that can be given intravenously is Benadryl. Since Benadryl is a first generation, it impacts our body in many ways **in addition** to the reason why its administered. Since first generation antihistamines are much **less** specific in their effects, they have more side effects.\n\nThough, being the only IV antihistamine available, it is still widely used in hospital settings (for anxiety included).\n\n## Benzodiazepines\n\n**alprazolam, xanax, chlordiazepoxide, librium, clonazepam, klonopin, clorazepate, tranxene, diazepam, valium, lorazepam, ativan, oxazepam, serax, temazepam, restoril, triazolam, halcion**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThese are commonly used as anxiety medicines (though can be used for seizures, insomnia, and muscle spasms). They work by quickly slowing down important parts of our brain.\n\nThis drug class specifically targets the GABA-A receptor, enhancing its effect, which **slows down** our central nervous system; this makes us feel relaxed, because the drug has retarted a major gear in our system (sometimes this is EXACTLY what we need).\n\nAnesthesiologists often give Versed (a benzodiazepine) so patients will not remember surgery?\n\nThe Drawbacks of Benzos\n\nWhen Benzodiazepines were first discovered they offered an immediate solution to the overwhelming crippling anxiety that many people face, but the harsh reality is were now in a benzo addiction crisis. Were learning over time as a society, and those changes dont happen overnight.\n\nThis drug class changes our mental state & while the drug is **advantageously quick acting**, the effects linger. Short-term memory is not as affected, but long-term memory is specifically impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory.\n\nThe effects are similar to the long-term effects of alcoholism (alcohol is also a CNS depressant). Both of these substances, used long term actually damage our brain.\n\nThis is why a rehab center isnt going to allow the use of this drug class while recovering. This is why therapists often (but not always) stray away from patients taking benzodiazepines while trying to work on trauma, recovery, etc. If the brain is not functioning at full capacity & youre not able to retain information, progress becomes much more difficult.\n\nThe most effective aspects of benzodiazepines are precisely why individuals have a tendency to become dependent on them.\n\nObviously, there is a time and a place for benzodiazepines. Theyre a life saver for the (hopefully) occasional panic attack. But how sadistic is that Benzodiazepines have addictive properties, which means that with consistent*repeated*use we will need**increasingly** higher doses.\n\nAnother point of concern is that this drug will inhibit your brain from initiating activity of GABA A (since the medication has so kindly been doing it). What this means is that after the drug is long gone from your system, your brain experiences a lag in restoring the normal GABA balance.\n\nThis is often what is referred to as*****rebound anxiety***** because your anxiety is likely to get worse, **before** it gets better after taking a benzodiazepine, especially if taken frequently and long term.\n\nThe mental health world is increasingly trying to move towards low dosing and only prescribing for a limited amount of time. Ive even worked with prescribers who wont prescribe them, period.\n\nNow, Benzodiazepines are very dangerous to quit cold turkey, so please dont go flush yours down the toilet after reading this!\n\n## Beta Blockers\n\n**acebutolol, atenolol, tenormin, bisoprolol, zebeta, metoprolol, lopressor, toprol XL, nadolol, corgard, nebivolol, bystolic, propranolol, inderal, innopran XL**\n\nDrug Class\n\nA beta blocker is most often used for heart conditions since this drug class lowers blood pressure and heart rate. But, they do this by blocking epinephrine which we commonly refer to as adrenaline. By blocking adrenaline, you prevent the progression of the physical symptoms of anxiety, like increased heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nThese can be prescribed as needed and is also prescribed long term to be taken regularly. Sometimes doctors will prescribe them for public speaking, or other stressful events someone has to face.\n\nWhat do Beta Blockers Do?\n\nWell, they Block Beta-adrenergic receptors, preventing norepinephrine and epinephrine from activating those receptors. This relaxes heart muscles, slows the heart beat, and lowers blood pressure.\n\nThat might seem completely unrelated to anxiety to some people, but when anxiety starts it will create **physical symptoms** that tend to make us feel even more panicked. This is why it can be pretty helpful to stop the physical symptoms from escalating an already *not-so-good* state of mind.\n\nDid you know?\n\nBeta blockers can be used for tremors, migraines, abnormal heart rhythms, and chest pain too.\n\nSummary\n\nBeta blockers can be a useful anxiety medication. As a nurse some of the things I pay attention to when a patient is prescribed them are obviously heart rate and blood pressure. **Energy level** is always something that can be impacted too.\n\nIts not uncommon for someone to become tired, groggy, lightheaded, or get headaches from beta blockers. Even for people who take it for high blood pressure and heart rate, it can have a tendency to drop them too low.\n\nEveryone is different, our diets change, our weight changes, our stress levels change, how hydrated we are fluctuates, our salt intake varies; and **all of these** impact our blood pressure. So, its always a good idea to be keeping an eye on your heart performance with a beta blocker and your doctor who is prescribing should be too.\n\n## Tricyclic Antidepressant | TCAs\n\n**anafranil, clomipramine, asendin, amoxapine, elavil, amitriptyline, norpramin, desipramine, pamelor, nortriptyline, sinequan, doxepin, surmontil, trimipramine, tofranil, imipramine, vivactil, protiptyline**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThe word tricyclic refers to the three molecular ring shapes associated with this drug class. These existed **before** SSRIs, but they seem to cause more side effects. This has led to SSRIs being more commonly prescribed nowadays.\n\nTCAs are still often prescribed for things like anxiety, depression, migraines, panic disorder, eating disorders, mood disorders, insomnia, hormone disorders, bedwetting, and even nerve pain.\n\nWhat do Tricyclic Antidepressants Do?\n\nWhat do **all** TCAs have in common? Similar to an SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants impact neurotransmitters. But, in addition to serotonin, they also block the reabsorption of norepinephrine. They ALSO block acetylcholine receptors.\n\nThese key differences from SSRIs create a cascade of effects in the body that make them a bit more likely to cause side effects; like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nIn 1945, the Sulphur bridge of the phenothiazine ring of promethazine was altered to synthesize G22355 (a weak antihistamine and mild anticholinergic with sedative properties). The new invention was tested as an antipsychotic. It was ineffective for schizophrenia, but did have antidepressant properties. Thus, the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) was discovered.\n\nSummary\n\nThese drugs interfere with our bodies baseline of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. As with any drug; sometimes they create an optimal effect on a person, as for others, not so much. If a person is too excitable and anxious, a TCA can improve their quality of life, while for another it can leave a bad impression.\n\n\\*Note each drug **within** the class impacts the *degree* of these effects a little differently.\n\n## Antipsychotics\n\n**sometimes referred to as major tranquilizers or neuroleptics**\n\n**risperidone, risperdal, quetiapine, seroquel, olanzapine, zyprexa, ziprasidone, zeldox, paliperidone, invega, aripiprazole, abilify, clozapine, clozaril, fluphenazine**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used as the first line treatment for schizophrenia & sometimes used for mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, Tourettes syndrome, Huntingtons disease, and anxiety.\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nMost drugs in this class work to block Dopamine, though some do impact other chemicals in the brain.\n\nSchizophrenia is the **major** psychotic disorder we use antipsychotics for. Some of the main symptoms are delusions, lack of motivation, unusual behaviors, and hallucinations. Dopamine has been thought to regulate our brains understanding of our surroundings and what it all means to us. So, its to be expected that drugs within this class target Dopamine.\n\nThis class is broken up into two categories;\n\n**First Generation (old, typical):** Block Dopamine-2 Receptors, which means they also block acetylcholine, histamine and norepinephrine. which can impact our cognition and the complex way in which we store memories.\n\n\\*More movement disorders come with the first generation antipsychotics.\n\n**Second Generation: (new, atypical):**Block Serotonin and Dopamine Receptors**.**Less risk of extra movements, increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and weight gain.\n\nHopefully this helps clarify some information on these common 7 classes of medications.

Thankfully the information I\'ve come across helped push me towards getting a formal diagnosis and beginning treatment - but since then I\'ve been stuck in a rut of mixed emotions ranging from having a late diagnosis and trying to find proper therapeutic methods of dealing with my condition. \n\n***As far as therapy and medication goes***; I\'ve been seeing a psychotherapist since I was diagnosed about 6 months ago, and have also been prescribed 3 different stimulant medication by my family doctor. ***(I\'m a rather poor self-observer so take the below information with a grain of salt)***  First one being Vyvanse; Which I was on for about 3 months, ending at 70mg daily - It was difficult for me to tell if it was working as intended, or not at all with no side effects to report. \n\nNext I was put on Concerta for about a month, ending at 54mg and abruptly stopping as I felt it aggravated many of my symptoms and felt worse on it. Following that, we decided on Adderall XR, starting at 40mg for a month; While I\'m pretty sure for about the first 2 or 3 weeks it was working, and working great ***(a few examples being; I was able to get through two books on ADHD, and actually retain a lot of the information which I\'ve NEVER been able to do. My mind usually just wanders mid-sentence, my eyes frantically jump around pages, and I have to read sentences over and over again with no comprehension. Also noticed it was easier to talk to people, and express myself, along with not finishing people\'s sentences as often or talking over them. Most noticeably I was able to hyperfocus and constantly keep myself productive and on task at work, considering having many distractions (manual labor in a precast concrete plant) )*** with the exception being that it made me feel rather fatigued mentally, but the endless amount of physical energy remain ...  until it wore off 5 hours later and my ""normal"" me would come back full swing, with a heavy wave of sleepiness ***(but still too restless to fall asleep)*** and depression/irritability. So my doctor added in an afternoon dose of 30mg, which I feel was helping me get through the last half of work and staying productive but by the time I finished work and got into my car, the  mental crash begins in full swing  ***(chronically dangerous habit of excessive speeding, reckless driving while being highly distractible)*** \n\nFlash forward to present moment, recently prescribed what I think is a monstrous dose of 110mg XR ***(subjective data on efficacy of medication but I\'m a 23 year old male standing at 6""5 and 300lbs with a wide stocky frame)*** spread out through out the day, I don\'t really notice any difference, with the same side effects to note as before, but with an unrelenting sense of fatigue and mental crash that seems to last from the time I wake up ***(before meds, and after meds)*** I\'m starting to feel really hopeless at this point, I know it takes time to find effective treatment but having recently started on a good trajectory I feel myself steadily losing the will to keep moving forward\n\nOn that note, I guess I\'m looking for any pointers or insight with regards to what concoction of meds, strategies, habits, etc that might be beneficial for me that I\'m not already doing; (I have a very fast paced, physically demanding and strenuous job for 50hrs/wk, while also getting in 5 lifts/wk in the gym, seeing a psychotherapist twice a month that specializes in CBT and ADHD, pretty much refrain completely from playing video games as I have no self-control and 12 hrs on a regular basis easily flies by, following a relatively strict diet high in protein, healthy fats, with adequate water intake, and no sugar or processed foods, daily cold showers, Also; I try to my best to keep a consistent schedule ***(alarm set for 4:30, and I try to be in bed by around 21:00)*** \n\nSince being diagnosed and trying to absorb all the information I can, I haven\'t felt the need to self-medicate with painkillers, cocaine, alcohol, and compulsive over-eating so that\'s really good, I feel there\'s still a lot of symptoms I\'m struggling with whether my meds are working for some symptoms or not at all, but notably my executive functioning skills are severely handicapped, severe time-blindness, and my sleep;\n\n I\'m far too restless at night with an overactive brain, and overactive body it results in it taking a long time for me to actually fall asleep. When I do fall asleep it doesn\'t seem to matter how little, or how much I sleep - I always wake up feeling like I haven\'t slept at all, and it takes a lot ton of effort to actually wake up on time .. I sleep like the living dead so I tend to need multiple very loud alarms on multiple devices in different places, and even them I either stupidly turn them off, forget to snooze, close my eyes for a second and wake up hours later. A lot of the time, when I do wake up - it takes me an insurmountable amount of time to physically get out of bed, followed by sluggishly dragging my feet around to get a move on. ***(as far back as I can remember my sleep/wake has always been this way, parents had extreme difficulties waking me up on time for school)***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n   ***For some deeply personal background information that may or may not be relevant;*** As far back as I can remember I\'ve always had significant struggles in most aspects of my life ranging from living with different parents, and changing schools year-to-year as a child with a strict mother, step-sister and a bit of an emotionally/physically abusive, alcoholic, and gambling addicted step-father; To living with a father whom I\'ve come to recently realize most likely suffers from a pre-dominantly inattentive form of ADD, I believe my struggles really began to appear when it was agreed that I move in with him longer-term, to a new country and city ***(at age 9 or 10)*** where for about less than a month my mother and father tried to work things out to my surprise .. came home from school one afternoon with a letter on the table, she had left with my sister to go back to my step-father ***(sister is half his kid)***.\n\n Anyways to sum this up as quickly as I can, when I started 6th grade I started to miss a lot of school ***(dad would leave before me in the morning)*** At one point I had missed a straight 2-3 weeks of school, staying home playing pc games till the school called him. Pretty sure I still missed a lot of school or classes following that moment, but I kept it on the DL more. By the start of 7th grade I was using my lunch money to buy drugs, started abusing opiates and anxiety medication - I never really felt that I fit in with the other kids always felt like an outcast and that I didn\'t belong, I was never able to really pay attention in class, was a class-clown and trouble maker. I was dyslexic and had another learning disability when I was younger, still might but never bothered to look into it more .. If it wasn\'t for being able to score high on tests and exams ***(on the exception of math)*** I would\'ve failed out of school miserably - never finished in-class work, very rarely completed homework, pretty much never handed in completed projects. Anyways, by the time I got to high school, my freshman year I overdosed while in gym class on a mixture of xanax, whiskey, and vicodin. Living with a father that was never really ""there"" for me, from what I remember he wasn\'t overly phased by it. Got into a lot more trouble in high school, got myself involved with the wrong kinds of people and did a lot of stupid, reckless shit over that time. I overdosed again somewhere near the end of the 10th grade, this time on a mixture of oxy\'s and dilaudid and that was the last straw. \n\nLife with my father was probably the worst thing for an undiagnosed kid now that I think about it more; No structure, no guidance, no parental supervision, most day to day conversations were along the lines of ""hi how was your day"" and ""good"" I had free roam and was able to do what I wanted, on the exception that because I was feeding myself for the most part, I was pushing close to 350lbs of pure fat, no physical activity and lots of video games. \n\nSo following the last time I OD\'ed, I had to move back in with my mother, step-father, and sister. Life slowly got a bit more manageable I suppose, but going from no supervision to very strict hard-ass parents was pretty awful for me, plus side is the next few years I only drank and smoked pot. \n\nStarted feeling like I was doing well considering ... then when I was around 18 I was started making decent money as a personal trainer while finishing up some courses I had failed in order to get my diploma ***(never walked on stage, prom, wasn\'t interested)*** parents started charging me absurd amounts of rent, so shortly after I was convinced to move in with my now ex-girlfriend and her family rent-free while I try to get a degree and focus on my life. I tried to go to college while working full time, I had an awful time .. constantly felt stupid and feelings of frustration started setting in that I could not direct my focus and concentrate on the needed material, so I kept trying, and I was trying hard but it just wasn\'t working. So I started socializing more and partying more, till I made another impulsive decision that required money and time so I dropped out. Her parents helped me get a loan of $10k from a bank to help pay for my school as neither of my parents could help me with the money, and refused to write a letter to help me get government assistance for tuition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShortly after I dropped out my life started to really go downhill, and fast. I spent about $3k on tuition, and the rest of that loan on tons of shit, all impulsive buys while her parents constantly questioned where the money was going if I wasn\'t in school anymore, anyways  I ended up getting bored and felt vastly under-stimulated with that girlfriend. Quickly realized we just weren\'t a good match, but instead of doing the right thing I ended up cheating on her on various occasions with  girls from parties, clubs, and prostitutes. This went on for a while before I suggested we take a break ***(I was moving out with a roommate so felt it was a good time to see if a break would make things better)*** \n\n***With further regards to debts;*** So I\'m about 19 or 20 at this point, parents helped me get a used car ***(although it was a shit box and I was sold a lemon)*** I appreciated my mom co-signing the loan for me. By this point I\'ve easily racked up about $20-30k of my mom\'s debt.. impulsive buying with expensive taste is a recipe for disaster. So back to the break with that girlfriend, after the month she ended up breaking up with me where I actually had a revelation of feelings and wanted to make things work. Yeah, I deserved it at the end of the day but I was heavily devastated, having been with her for 3 years. Shortly after, I get offered a credit card with a $20k limit, 0% interest for 6 months - that\'s awesome right! fuck me was I wrong, as if I didn\'t rack up enough debt already. Literally maxed it out and went over the limit by the time the 3rd or 4th month rolled around, I\'m fucked right? I\'ve always worked at minimum 2 jobs at a time, but somehow never had any money outside of paying bills. So shortly after I get an opportunity to get a 3rd job, all in I thought I was making decent coin but who would\'ve thought that working 90hrs a week wasn\'t even close to sustainable for a long period of time? Not me! I traded in that shitbox of a car and got myself into a brand new mid-grade sports car loan, total of $60k with the trade in. Does the spending end there?! Nope! Got injured at work, along with burning myself out I was fired from 2 of those jobs. One thing led to another and I was bouncing around from place to place living with friends, to short-term roommates, to sleeping in my car and living out of it. By the time I was 21 or 22 I had accumulated over $120k of PERSONAL debt, not counting what I owed to my mother. I was heavily pushed into declaring bankruptcy at 22, although I probably had no choice realistically. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the middle of all the above fiasco, I ended up getting involved with a woman that was very very bad for me. Extremely toxic relationship, lots of bad deeds happened during this time. One of them being that she was heavy into abusing her prescriptions, and recreational drug use. At this point I\'ve probably had upwards of 20-30 different jobs, where most of them I was fired for being chronically late, absent, or my temper would come out and I\'d tell my supervisor to fuck off,  Another large percentage of those jobs were short-term, where I impulsively quit, or just abandoned completely ***(usually because I felt too anxious to call or show up)*** \n\nThis was also the time period in my life where I started to use cocaine and speed .. followed by crack. All really dark times in my past and it\'s painful for me to write it down and see it in front of me, but that\'s the reality. However the use of the above drugs, along with a toxic relationship were the missing ingredients I needed in my life that led me to my diagnosis. I found it strange how neurotypical people acted on stimulants .. they almost acted how I act normally (fidgeting, excessive and fast talking, etc) where as I felt this wave of relaxation and fog dissipating feeling. I could actually focus on something that didn\'t interest me, would feel a weird urge of being able to sit completely still, and just want to stare at a wall. I could think clearly. While being able to sleep like a baby afterwards, felt no urge to do more, or excessive amounts ""fiending"" was non-existent for me, and I was able to eat right after a line. All very strange to me at the time so i started researching it. I feel it\'s important for me to note that since self-discovery and diagnosis, I no longer feel the need, or urge to abuse any kind of drug. I no longer compulsively self-medicate to ease my symptoms and cope with my world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSooo I kinda lost my point there, or where I was really going with all of this so here\'s a summary for you;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***TL;DR -*** at a really rough time in my life following a fairly recent diagnosis and discovery of ADHD-C, but feel extremely hopeless because I can\'t seem to find the proper medication and other forms of symptom alleviation. Doctor isn\'t a specialist in the field, so we usually sit down and research what the next best thing to try is. Have tried vyvanse, concerta, and now adderall xr currently at 110mg/day - still feels ineffective. Do I need to treat the depression, and possibly the anxiety along with a stimulant medication for the ADHD? Having accumulated asburd amounts of debt at a young age, and now being bankrupt with no options left for help ***(along with about $5k worth of PAY-DAY Loans accumulated shortly after bankruptcy and before diagnosis)*** how can I try to see the light at the end of the tunnel when I\'ve been working dead-end, unsatisfying, un-stimulating jobs for years and barely making a dent in any of my debts while also having no money to have a somewhat pleasure-able quality of life? I\'d like to go back to school and get myself into a more rewarding career but due to the debts, I\'m fucked for loans for another 8 years and that feels like a  depressively long time to START my education and work these shit jobs that I can\'t seem to hold down for a reasonable length of time. I\'m constantly playing catch up.. lose a job and have no money for a while, start a job, start slowly catching up on the necessities and then another fuck up and I\'m back to a worse position. Most recently I\'ve started working at a good company, while it\'s exhausting, and tough on my body - It\'s also pretty repetitive, and boring as fuck. While the pay and benefits are the best I\'ve ever been able to land myself into I feel I won\'t last much longer there because of the way I\'ve been feeling I have zero motivation to drag my ass to work. It\'s exhausting to even just get out of bed and get my day started lately which is fucking pathetic and sad, it\'s a basic human need. Everyone has to work and has financial obligations, etc.. I\'m just really lost now, and I have no one to really turn to, as unfortunate as it is I\'ve completely torched many of my friendships, familial relationships, etc. I\'m carrying so much guilt and other emotions over my head I hardly feel the urge to fight on anymore. I don\'t know what my strengths or weaknesses are, or what my talents are. I feel light-years behind everyone I grew up with in every single aspect of life and I just feel like a shitty, talentless, unproductive, lazy, waste of space. \n\nMy self esteem, confidence, and how I view myself is just atrocious, I have this dreading sense that I\'ll never be happy or succeed in any walks of life. ***(important to note that I don\'t feel suicidal, while sometimes I admit I feel the urge to slam my car into a highway barrier at full speed, I don\'t think I ever would, or I would\'ve done so by now)*** my dream growing up and even into early adulthood was always to be in the military but I\'ve always had something holding me back, whether it was a girlfriend, family never being supportive of it, fear of failing yet again and making a fool of myself. But now I\'m on medication for ADHD-C, along with a major depression diagnosis and very likely anxiety as well - they\'d never take a glimpse at my application due to the liabilities and medication. ***(have to be off for 1 year)*** I\'ve already missed quite a few days having started at this job recently, along with being late a few times so I fear I will inevitably lose it within the coming days or weeks. I fear what happens next, will I be able to bounce back this time? After living in my car for the better part of 7 months, my mom convinced me to move back in till I get my feet on the ground - while I never wanted to, I knew it would make her happier and ease her stress not having to worry about me as much. Now with the way my finances are, and the fact that my step-father and I don\'t really get along (he fails to understand or acknowledge ADHD) and consistently puts me down when I\'m already hard enough as it is on myself. I try to keep myself in check because there\'s no sense in arguing with him because he\'s incapable of taking anyone else\'s opinion but his own. But I can only bottle my emotions up for so long .. I know some parts of myself pretty well by now, and while sometimes I\'m quite surprisingly patient ... other times I just can\'t and I snap, like full on rage ***(never violent)*** but a scary sight nevertheless and I don\'t want that to happen here because then I\'m absolutely fucked beyond belief. Meanwhile since educating myself a lot about the disorder, I see a lot of ADHD traits in him, and my mom a mixture of both, like myself. My sister also has ADD, although diagnosed when she was younger she might have a better fighting chance at life than me, and I\'ll help make sure of that - but when her father fails to understand her struggles and undermines her like he did with me and still does, it drives me fucking insane. She\'s a teen and those are her crucial years imo.\n\n ***(For DSM criteria\'s sake which I think is bullshit and doesn\'t even come close to grasping the actual struggles we deal with; I was officially diagnosed at a place that specializes in CBT, and more specifically, Adult ADHD. 9/9 Inattentive, 7/9 Hyperactive/Impulsive, Major Depression. Costed me a little over $2k, and it took about 2-3 months of testings, appointments, and follow-ups before I could be recommended treatment with medication.)***\n\n***\\*I think I\'ll stop there, sorry for the endless ranting, but I\'ve had these feelings and emotions locked in a cage and buried for a long while. I needed somewhere I could vent and seek any kind of insight, advice, or help from people with a similar brain to myself, because I feel myself slipping far from the ledge I somehow managed to haul myself over. I feel I\'m at my wits end and I don\'t know how I feel about that.\\****\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for your time, and patience. I apologize again for the very lengthy, and unorganized layout of this post.. my points are kind of spread out and all over the place, and I caught myself going on unnecessary rants but this is all a quick summary of my life, how it has played out and where I am now. If you did manage to read most of it, congratulations - your medication must be working for ya ;) I look forward to hearing from any of you, with whatever input you have to offer whether it be good or bad. I\'ll take it as best as I can, and with a grain of salt :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUntil then, I\'ll take my therapists advice and take it one day at a time. Take care!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-EFD out'"

Yesterday at a family function, I had a winter coat on, zipped up, hood over my head, a blanket over my legs, another over my coat and had my FIL light a fire in the wood burning stove I was sitting next to.

Where else to turn but the internet for answers (quite dangerous I know. After I had Covid-19 this year (January) for the 1st time I had a lingering cough for a while that went away. Then around March, I started to have a Sore or tender breastbone with a slight urge to cough. The pain is just more slightly to the right than in the center. I went to Urgent care for them to do an ECG and they found nothing. I went to my General Care and I have been treated for Allergies, Asthma, Gerd & Costochondritis. (Also make note the stomach discomfort started just a few weeks ago and may be a result of stopping GERD Medication after a month)\n\nAll treatments thus far have failed me and I was on Prednisone for a week as the latest treatment and that made the chest pain worse (That or it was a really stressful week). I am running out of ideas here and am seeing a Cardiologist on Wednesday to see if they have any ideas. REDDIT I NEED YOUR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE MORE THAN EVER!!! Any questions you have I will answer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright everyone, As you know I went to the Cardiologist yesterday and got the news. Apparently its called **pericarditis** and it commonly happens after infections like covid-19. However I have a long term form known as Chronic Constrictive Pericarditis as most cases only last a 4 to 6 weeks this can last from 3 months to over a year. Its easily treatable by Taking NSAIDs like Max strength Ibuprofen to reduce inflammation to allow the heart to heal, but some cases but rarely require surgery if severe scarring has occurred. I am going back today for a Cardiogram so my cardiologist can see if there is any long term damage (He doubts it as I am young and healthy). Thank you everyone for your ideas and suggestions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate 4/5/23\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs requested here is another update. As of now, I have gone through several other tests such as a barium swallow test, upper endoscopy, and chest x-rays. After further investigation by my doctor after reviewing all the data she has come to the conclusion that I have 2 separate problems. 1st is the chest pain she believes that covid has caused some long-term damage that has produced moderate asthma made worse by my stressful lifestyle, she has switched inhalers to albuterol sulfate 90 mcg which has been helping with the issue. As for the Burning throat, we are still going with GERD. However, my body is really only reacting well to famotidine 40mg tablets. I have had little to no results with anything else (omeprazole, esomeprazole, Pepcid, Pepto, Tums, ETC). I have been on this new medication as of 03/09/23 and have seen improvements in my energy and pain relief. I am now able to go outside and be active for extended periods of time (About an hour of light to moderate physical activity). I would say I have improved by around 50% to 60%. Not every day is perfect but it has been better and much more bearable than before. My girlfriend of 4 years sees my normal self coming back as well as my energy.

ativan,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/13fbta6/ativan_withdrawal_help_needed/,b'Ativan withdrawal??? Help needed',,"b'Hey yall. I (27F) have been prescribed Ativan for insomnia and anxiety attacks for the past 8 years I was taking between 1-2mg a day, as prescribed, and never really thought twice about it. I took it to sleep every single night, and it helped immensely with my insomnia. About 7 months ago, I started to get really nervous about my cognitive function and memory so I decided to start tapering off the Ativan - starting back in January of this year. I am working with a psychiatrist and went for a very slow taper off the Ativan bc I am super sensitive to drugs, side effects and withdrawal symptoms. I cut the Ativan down by about 10% every few weeks under and last week was my last dose. These last few months have been miserable.. Im barely functional and have lost any confidence that I used to have in my basic ability to live on my own and take care of myself. I feel like Ive lost myself completely and Im only a shell of a person now. I am zoned out and disconnected all the time, I have severely bad depersonalization and derealization, and am constantly dissociating. My social anxiety has shot through the roof and Im so depressed I have no desire to do anything at all. By some miracle Ive managed to keep my job, which that I used to love, but now I hate it. I hate doing just about everything that I used to love but I think the worst part is I cant remember anything and I feel like such an idiot.. I avoid talking to people and being around people at all costs, even my friends. All I want to do is be alone and sleep, watch tv or literally just stare at the wall. Is this normal??\n\nI took my last dose of Ativan (about .1mg) 5 nights ago and Ive had a searing migraine ever since, advil and Tylenol arent doing shit.

celebrex,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/re5nvl/am_i_taking_too_much_medicine/,b'Am I taking too much medicine?',,"b""Hi everyone, I'm a 27m suffering from Agoraphobia w/Panic Attack disorder for the last 8 years. Not enough words to jot down the whole history. I'm just seeking some guidance.\n\nI moved to a new psychiatrist 3 months ago and this is what I'm taking on a daily basis:\n\n\\- Prozac 60 mg w/breakfast\n\n\\- Effexor 300mg w/dinner\n\n\\- Xanax 0.5 mg twice a day\n\n\\- Seroquel 25mg at night\n\n\\- Valium 5 mg if needed\n\n\\- Celebrex 200mg twice a day\n\nHe started on low doses but quickly ramped it up. I've been on this for a month now.\n\nThe first month I was seeing improvements. More fatigue but less panic and willing to go out more and drive further. The second month was getting better until halfway. I got plagued with derealization, migraines, and severe diziness. Tried to shake it off but so far still have them.\n\nAlso for the last 3 weeks I've got inflammation all over my body and joints. I feel like I'm being bound down. It aches to move. Feels like my joints are locked and I'm so tense 24/7. Also the anxiety is back with a vengenance. As if I wasn't on these meds anymore. Very tired. Dizzy. Sensitive to light, loud noises, everything really.\n\nI saw a Rheumatologist for the joint and body pain and got a cortisone shot to help relieve it. No effect really. Celebrex is barely helping.\n\nDo you think this could be side effects from all of these meds? Am I just supposed to ride it out? Have the Benzos stopped working for anxiety? I also take Paracetamol on top of all this if I reach to a point where I can't handle my head exploding.\n\nI'm always walking around like there's sun on top of me. Squinting from the pain of the migraine and feel like I'm floating most of the time."""
celexa,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/13x51o6/feeling_lost_and_frustrated_with_myself/,b'Feeling lost and frustrated with myself',,"b""I'm  sure there are many threads like this, so I'll try my best to keep  things brief. But we'll see how that pans out, as the situation is a bit  of a doozy. Or perhaps, the much-feared combination of doozies. A  multi-doozy epoch, if you will.\n\nAt  the outset of the pandemic, I got laid off from a job where I had some  decent opportunities and great, supportive colleagues. I had a tough  time finding work after that - quotidian lockdown stressors, job  hunting, and maladaptive coping strategies sent me spiralling into a  manic episode where I had to be hospitalized... Obviously this was  world-shattering and terrifying.\n\nI  spend the following year-and-a-half working a job where I feel totally  underemployed and useless. Once my contract runs out, I find myself in a  near-identical situation to 2020 after my contract expires.\n\nOut of work -> bored -> depressed -> pot/alcohol -> funny farm for a few days.\n\nThis  time was much worse and I successfully scared the living shit out of my  partner and friends, only bolstering my sense of alienation further.\n\nThis  time, my manic behavior was so awful, that I had to move back home with  my parents due to the way I was treating my partner. The immediate  month out of the hospital I felt totally estranged from reality and  living back home brought to surface many reminders of why I moved out at  such a young age.\n\nSome key things to note.\n\nOne,  I am aware that I am a fucking idiot - if insanity is making the same  mistake twice and expecting different results, then the shoe does indeed  fit well.\n\nTwo, my partner after  both episodes has chosen to stay with me. I am confused, yet eternally  grateful for that, but I will eternally feel guilty. So that's a healthy  dynamic, especially when talks of marriage are on the table (I have  suggested couple's therapy and she's amenable).\n\nThree,  my experiences with my industry (biotech) have left me completely jaded  towards the field. Yet, I am at the moment pigeonholed by my  experience. I want to switch careers (IT/lab automation/data  science...I'm open to options), but I am completely at a loss for a path  forward. A master's degree seems most sensible, but where is the money  for that coming from when I'm currently unemployed and still saddled  with undergrad debt?\n\nFour, I do  have a psych and therapist. Still unsure if the meds I'm on are right  for me though (wellbutrin+celexa: been equally interested and repulsed  by the idea of ketamine therapy or my skin potentially falling off via  lamictal).\n\nDespite these  experiences, I am still at my core an ambitious person. I love learning  and desparately want to improve my circumstances, however as I get older  (28 now...) my preoccupation with past failures and acute awareness of  limitations set forth by Time (and how I've routinely mispent it)  hampers my motivation. Too many of my figs have gone black as I sit  paralyzed with regret and self-loathing.\n\nI  have no schedule right now and every fiber of my being seems to resist  creating and adhering to one. Why? I can only guess, but as with other  failed attempts at self-improvement, it's most likely distrusting that I  will actually follow through with whatever my new goal might be. I  usually stick to a new habit for three days or so then just say 'fuck  it' and return to complacency.\n\n7 Habits of This Highly Ineffective Person:\n\n1. Eating/drinking alcohol out of boredom (for the record I completely quit pot, at least)\n2. Joylessly masturbating multiple times a day and then self-flagellating over porn usage\n3. Waking up to a 'PM' on the clock\n4. Chronic procrastination vis-a-vis video games, half-assed engagement with hobbies, scrolling\n5. Refusing to exercise and taking minimal action towards self-care\n6. Engaging  with the world in such a negative, critical light and almost believing  that those who don't (aka those who are happy, or at least content) are  ignorant...\n7. Leaving the door and windows unlocked for Comparison to come and go, looting happiness as it pleases\n\nAwareness  of these issues obviously isn't enough, but I feel like I have so much  to overcome that overwhelm just pushes me from one shitty habit to the  next, creating the illusion of activity.\n\nI  want to give up (or more realistically...severely limit my usage of)  alcohol, pornography, sugar, social media - essentially all those common  Opiate of the Masses types of things. And start exercising, reading the  hundred or so books on my backlog, reengaging with hobbies in a  thoughtful way. However, I just find a litany of excuses. Or in the case  of something like choosing a book from my library, I'm greeted with the  doubt that I'll finish it and even if I do, when's the next time I'm  going to find the motivation to read another one? Surely it's a futile  effort...(\\*eyeroll reacts only\\*)\n\nI  want to exercise, oh but my bike is too small and I don't have the  money for a new one...What about body weight exercises? Yeah, I  guess...I don't have a yoga mat though... How about going for a walk  then? My neighborhood isn't very walkable and I don't want to drive  somewhere just to walk, seems silly.\n\nI  want to improve my coding skills, but oh there are so many languages  and I'm too dumb to remember syntax and vocabularly, let alone  logic...Well you can just do what everyone else does and google those  things as need, plus didn't you take many advanced math courses in  undergrad? Yeah... but ever since my hospitalizations, I feel stupid and  incapable of remembering things.\n\nI  want to be more intentional with my art, but well there are so many  more talented writers/musicians/artists out there and what are the odds  of getting exposure? Shouldn't the primary goal of art be to nourish the  soul or whatever? Yeah...but, I should be using that time to job hunt.  Yeah, I suppose, but you aren't, you're just in bed, playing Tetris 99  ad infinitum and listening to shitty podcasts...\n\nI  just want to find the motivation to get back to work. Having income, a  place to go, a slight sense of purpose would improve my overall  situation greatly.  I have been searching for months and have landed  interviews, a handful going to final rounds, only to get ghosted at the  offer stage...I just feel less and less resilient with each setback. I  used to be strong and iron-willed - I would like that back.\n\nUnsure  what the end goal of this post is, I could really go on for hours.  Perhaps it was just to force myself to get some of this bile out of my  body and onto paper. That said, I'm always open to thoughtful  suggestions and enjoy the comfort of shared experiences."""
cipro,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/10p3du2/caplyta_nightmare/,b'Caplyta Nightmare',,"b'Just wanted to share what Ive recently been through in case anyone experiences anything similar. Two weeks ago on a Saturday I started feeling extremely foggy and detached. I thought it might be from the Lithium I had recently started taking so I stopped taking it. That Monday I started having UTI symptoms and feeling sick, mainly feeling like I had to pee all the time and bladder pressure. I went to urgent care and they said my dipstick test didnt show signs of UTI but told me to go get Lithium levels drawn when I described the brain fog along with it. I spent all day in the ER and they told me my Lithium levels and blood work were fine and sent me home without a diagnosis even though I felt awful. The next day I went to my regular doctor and she prescribed me antibiotic. I was convinced I had a kidney infection because I started having pain and felt so sick and weird mentally. That Friday after I had finished my 3 day antibiotic I still had all the symptoms. I thought it probably was just not long enough antibiotics for a kidney infection (even though it had never been confirmed by labs if I had one or not). I went to the dr and was prescribed 10 days of Cipro. I kept feeling sick and actually kept getting worse. I felt completely detached and like I was in a fog like I had been drugged. I started having a lot of abdomen pain all over. On day 9 of my Cipro I went back to the ER. I thought something must be seriously wrong with me and was very scared. At the ER I was diagnosed with Mecentroc Andenitis which is a condition when the lymph nodes in the abdomen get painfully inflamed. They told me it was probably caused by a virus and would resolve on its own. At first I was happy to have a diagnosis and know what was going on but the next day I started feeling uneasy. I felt in my gut something else was wrong and there was something off that had caused it because it didnt explain how I was feeling mentally. I started searching trying to find out what could possibly be going on and discovered that Cipro and Caplyta have a serious drug interaction and that taking them together cause Caplyta levels in your body to raise drastically and be toxic. Reading more about Caplyta and the side effects I believe it was causing all my symptoms from the beginning and then I was put on an antibiotic for a UTI I never had that made everything even worse. I will not be taking Caplyta again. What I take from this is you have to take your medical care in your own hands and be persistent. 3 different doctors 2 different ERs and I had to be the one to figure out what was going on myself.'"

Has anyone here been able to stop taking concerta and gotten out of it okay? I have been on it since I was in grade 3 (now 3rd year uni) and I have studied research techniques on how to study and how to focus so I know that I can be fine off of it. I know that the body can develop a reliance on it and I want to get off of it because it makes my insomnia worse, however I am unsure what to do. I am probably gonna keep taking it until I am done with university because I don't want it to get in the way with my studies but at the same time I am curious if anyone else here has gone through the same thing that I am about to go through."""

No injury 'event' - just woke up one day with a sore back and the leg pain a few days later. Did PT and meds for a couple weeks, then had an MRI done. Finding was a 9mm extrusion at L5-S1 compressing the S1 nerve root. I have a spine specialist appointment but it's still another month away,  but checking and hoping for a cancelation so I can get in sooner. In the meantime, I'm taking 15mg of meloxicam daily, frequently with acetaminophen, and vicodin occasionally when the pain is too much.

I got an inversion table cheap and gave it a try and it seems to help as long as I don't go too steep (20 degrees) or too long (3 minutes or so a couple times daily).

gabapentin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/hmao7o/pain_in_side_of_head_affecting_quality_of_life/,b'Pain in side of head affecting quality of life and out of ideas..',,"b'^(A new account for sake of privacy.) \n\nI\'ve been experiencing a pain in the left-side of my head that has continued to get worse over time. As well as a experiencing a pain, I often get other symptoms such as a high tempertature across my head, specifically the ears and cheeks as these get hot to touch - on both sides too, not just the left-side of my face. \n\n^(To hopefully help with reading, I\'m from the UK...)\n\nMy story is a bit of a long one, one that started 3 or 4 years ago with a ""tingle"" across my upper teeth which I really noticed towards the end of a working day, such as being in a late in the day meeting or maybe driving home. I would often feel tired at these times too, however I would get home and feel okay again, I put this down to maybe the office environment I was in or just my food and/or caffiene intake towards the end of a day. My first port of call was to visit a Dentist after riding out my odd symptoms for some months. I\'ve since visited, some on more than once occasion, a Dentist, Endodontist, Chiropractor, General Practitioner, Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeon, Ear Nose Throat, Neurology and now back in the hands of my GP, looking at possibly being passed to a ""Local Pain Service"" which from my understanding is the end of the road e.g. we can\'t find the source so we\'ll treat the pain from here on. \n\nI just wish someone would find the cause, I\'m not even worried about a solution at the moment. Although things have worsened over time, especially the last year I\'d say, a signifcant treatment was a Root Canal that I had undergone on my upper-left 1st molar (if I\'m right in saying that my wisdom is the 3rd molar), this is where the Endodontist came in. It was extremely tender after the treatment and it never got better. I was actually referred to the Endodontist by my regular Dentist as they couldn\'t see a problem with a tooth, however, after having a scan on a more premium-like device, the Endodontist was able to see that I needed a Root Canal (deeply filled is my understanding). Back and forth I went with the Endodontist but they couldn\'t see anything. My Dentist also couldn\'t see anything and noted that my wisdom teeth were not impacted in any way, they appear fine and I apparently manage to clean them well. My Dentist also checked for Temporomandibular disorder by pushing his thumb into the left-side of my mouth, presumably pushing on a jaw muscle, and asked if it hurt. I could only think it just felt like a full-grown man pushing his thumb into my jaw, but nothing notably painful about it. I met resistance with the Dentist and Endodontist so I went back to my GP. \n\nMy GP gave me a nasal spray. I\'ve complained throughout my past that my nose is very blocked but I\'ve been told my nasal passage is clear, and because of this I\'ve been prescribed many different nasal sprays which never seemed to work. I can\'t blame the GP for trying another one but I was again frustrated. I paid to see a Oral & Maxillofacial specialist who took an xray and assessed my syptoms, coming to the conclusion that I should have a CT scan, to which I accepted. Back at my local hospital, I had the CT scan which concluded I have a cyst in my right maxillary sinus, small enough to not be of concern following feedback from ENT.  ENT passed me to Neurology who said I should be passed back to ENT as the neuropathic medication they prescribed me weren\'t effective. At the time of writing I am taking Gabapentin which is just making me feel sleepy, if anything. \n\nA last spurt of information.. I get clicks and ""crunches"" when yawning wide, or even moving my jaw from left to right in an unnatural movement. I often feel like there\'s a subtle similar pain above my upper-right molars too, again it feels like the wisdom. I can\'t 100% attribute the pain to any tooth but I\'ve consistenly described how there\'s a feeling of pressure, much like when I had an abscess once but was able to drain it which relieved the pressure - this resulted in a molar removal in my bottom-left side. I have no problem eating, if anything it can relieve the pain I have for that time. I just can\'t concentrate on things, I feel a litte bit sick sometimes and it\'s really affected my mood over time. Oh, and hangovers are horrendous as the dominant pain in the left-side of my head is amplified massively the next morning, I can\'t explain how bad that is and I\'ve put myself off socialising with alchohol at times because of it! \n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated. I\'m sorry for how much I\'ve wrote, I\'m sure I could publish it in hardback one day but I\'m really just looking for hope that some way or another I\'ll be able to at least manage whatever it is that is going on...'"

I am still uncertain if the medication is responsible for these symptoms. I have not been on metoclopramide since december and the reason I bring this up is because I know that this medication has been known to cause nerve issues so the medication can be a variable to why I am having these issues\n\nA few days after my symptoms went away I got sick for about a month in January (consisting of a sore throat, cough, and brain fog) (Covid-19 test was negative). Once I recovered from my symptoms, my symptoms came back\n\nIn late January, my symptoms were:\n\nsore/tight masseter that would get more tight or sore when pressure is pushed against my masseter region for an extended period of time (such as if I lay on my masseter region, it will get tight or sore)\n\nMy soreness would mostly be on the right side of my face, but sometimes the left\n\nMy soreness expands from the masseter, sometimes to my jaw, and to my upper neck region especially the upper right side of my neck\n\nSometimes, my upper right side of my neck/lower side of masseter feels like it wants me to spasm my face towards that direction to calm down my symptoms, I believe I am doing this voluntarily but sometimes I would have a tic in response to the pain (as seen in the video I will show)\n\nThese symptoms have lasted from late January to present day; however, around late february and early march, I have developed more symptoms which include:\n\nMinor non-painful muscle contractions where my muscle will pop in and out (sometimes it doesnt visibly pop in and out but it feels like it does). I have a video example of this happening in my leg that I will show.\n\nThese involuntary muscle contractions have happened within my thigh both legs, my calf both legs, my buttocks region, upper arm region, and sometimes upper right side of neck\n\nOther symptoms include a loose arm feeling that would sometimes happen with lower to upper arm area\n\nMy legs get tight randomly, usually getting tight when more pressure is applied to muscles or when I am doing simple activities such as walking.\n\nMy legs and arms sometimes feel fatigued and a loose type of feeling, despite this, my legs are capable of moving around normally and I am able to lift my legs up normally (as in my legs are not completely weak, or even weak in general perhaps)\n\nMy toes randomly have a tingly, tense feeling which is triggered more when I wear socks but sometimes happens when I am not wearing socks. I think my toes might be twitching slightly but I am unsure.\n\nI have been having mouth tension feelings where my mouth feels tense, despite this, my mouth have been completely in control, just a weird feeling in general\n\nI have sometimes felt a popping sensation between my upper lip and my gums that happens when I move my upper lip to make my mouth feel more comfortable\n\nThe leg tightness and mouth tension have developed a bit more in the past few days. Recently my legs have been having slight pain but very minor pain. Sometimes it feels like my mouth might be having tics but I have yet to notice anything in a mirror\n\nSometimes my symptoms are severe, sometimes they are not. My symptoms have been random and I have had them every day, but they are not always constant.\n\nSometimes I have a popping sensitive feeling between my upper lips and my gums and sometimes my mouth feels sensitive\n\nI have also began feeling slight pain in my legs and close to my back leg area\n\n**Symptoms I am not having:**\n\nI am having no involuntary movements, I am in full control of my body especially my mouth, nose, eyes, ears, and eyelids\n\nI dont think I have Tardive Dyskinesia, I saw a UCI neurologist that tested me for TD (prior to me developing symptoms throughout my body) which declared that I do not have TD as I was on a low dose of Metoclopramide and the chances of me developing TD at my dosage was extremely rare.\n\nMetoclopramide is known to also potentially cause akathisia and dystonia, both of which I dont think I am having symptoms of\n\nI do not think it is ALS as this happens mostly in older patients and starts asymmetrically on a foot or hand which is not how my symptoms started. (Hopefully it is not ALS)\n\nI do not think it is fibromyalgia despite my symptoms being similar, as fibromyalgia mostly happens in women and is more severe\n\n**Possible Causes:**\n\nThe cause of my symptoms are not confirmed to be metoclopramide but my symptoms did develop when I was taking this medication; however I developed more symptoms even after I was off of the medication for months and my symptoms did not really start until over a month after I had been off the medication. I was also on a low 5mg metoclopramide dosage. I could possibly have side effects from the medication but I am unsure. Metoclopramide could cause drug-induced parkinsonism and some of my symptoms resonate with this temporary disease; however, a lot of the other symptoms that this causes I am not having such as trembling or a shaking presence or drooling. My grandpa passed away due to Parkinson's so parkinsions might run in my family. I could also be having other long term side effects from the medication that are not anything specifically diagnosable\n\nI am currently low on Vitamin D, my levels are at 17 (I will attach my blood results to this document)\n\nAround the same time I was taking this medication, I was excessively chewing gum for the past few months every day. My symptoms early on did sound like TMD jaw symptoms which my dentist, primary doctor, and an ears/nose/throat specialist thought I could have. I thought this at first; however, I began developing symptoms throughout my body so I am unsure if this could be TMD/TMJ issues. The three doctors I mentioned above I saw for these symptoms prior to my symptoms occurring throughout my body. My dentist and ears/nose/throat specialist noticed that my masseter region was tight when they were feeling/massaging this region. My primary doctor noticed that I did have a slight popping feeling when I open my mouth wide, and It has been originally a bit difficult to open my mouth wide, this however still does not explain why I have had symptoms throughout my body\n\nI have been in my house a lot and have not received a lot of sunlight. I have also not been getting a lot of exercise or doing a lot of activities lately\n\nI do deal with anxiety and minor depression issues, however, I am absolutely convinced that anxiety/depression are not the cause of my symptoms. They may be the reason my symptoms get worse at times when I am already having the symptoms, but I dont think they are the cause\n\n**Possible Causes/Medications I have been taking**\n\nI currently have G.E.R.D and have been taking PPIs since the summer to treat these symptoms. I have been on the same dosage (40mgs once a day). The PPIs I have been on are pantoprazole at one point, dexilant at one point, and for the past few months I have been taking omeprazole as my preferred PPI. Recently, I have also been taking Pepcid twice a day starting about a week/two weeks ago. The reason I originally took metoclopramide was to treat my G.E.R.D.\n\nI have been on a symbicort Budesonide 80 mcg inhaler (two puffs in the morning, two puffs at night) every day since october. I was originally on a 160 mcg version of this inhaler with the same amount of puffs (4 puffs in one day, 2 at night, 2 in morning) from mid august to mid october.\n\nDuring my sickness, I took azithromycin 250 mg tablets (2 tablets one day and then 1 tablet for four days) back in late january.\n\nI have been taking digestive enzymes and Zinlori 75\n\nI am taking Vitamin D pills and Vitamin K1 and K2 pills to combat my low vitamin levels\n\nI am taking wart removal medication for a wart at the bottom of my foot for over a year now (treatment done once a day). Verucide wart removal solution applied physically to the war at the bottom of my right foot.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was on cyclobenzaprine for a few days (3 tablets a day) (10mg). These symptoms caused me heartburn and for my G.E.R.D to come back which I have luckily been able to control thanks to Pepcid.\n\nSymptoms unrelated to my medications could be the cause such as a pinched nerve or some other neurological issue (hopefully not)\n\n**Doctors I have seen**\n\nI have seen a primary doctor a few times + a blood test, a dentist, a walk in clinic, multiple pharmacists, ears/nose/throat specialist, and a neurologist. I called my gastrologist and pulmonologist at one point.\n\nMy primary doctor does not think the metoclopramide is the cause of my symptoms and does not think I have TD; however, she does not know what I have and she referred me to see you for a second opinion\n\nMy neurologist tested me for TD and that is it, he was not that helpful in figuring out my symptoms; however, I saw him before symptoms spread throughout my body\n\nMy ears/nose/throat specialist and dentist thought I could have TMD or TMJ; however, I saw both of them before symptoms spread throughout my body.\n\n**Update:**\n\nI recently saw my neurologist which said it could be from anxiety or an undiagnosed issue, he said I could get an EMG/NCV test, MRI scan, see an endocrinologist, rheumatologist, and get a CK Muscle Enzyme Test. My neurologist thought that the medication (Metoclopramide) did NOT cause my symptoms but is unsure what is wrong with me, he thinks it is not a neurological issue rather an issue with my muscles."""
penicillin problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/zqbm2d/i_really_need_advice_urgently/,b'I really need advice urgently',,"b'Long story short: \n\nIn September, I had a broken tooth filled up but it was a dumb decision bc it didnt work and a root canal was necessary, so After a bit it started hurting like crazy and I had to pay a crap lot to fly to another city just to get an emergency dentist appointment as there was no one available in my town for the next 3 months. The pain was unbearable so I had no choice. The dentist over there started a root treatment but didnt finish, patched it and said that I should take another appointment asap, but the closest appointment being 3 months away back home. \n\nFast forward to 10 days ago, it started hurting again, I used my brain and figured out that it must be caused by some infection, luckily I had some leftover penicillin which fixed most of the pain. \n\nToday, I had an appointment, supposedly to finish the root treatment but no, I apparently had some infected abscess making it impossible to finish it now so he just drained it and sanitised my tooth. Now, idk wtf he did but the pain that came afterwards is unbearable. Ive been crying the whole day bc of the pain, Its honestly probably the worst pain Ive ever been through and its not even been 24h. The pain is reaching all the way to my ear, whole jaw and even my arm. He took scans of my tooth, everything is in order he said and that the pain would go away within 2 days but I have a hard time believing this as 20 hours later, not even amoxicillin or 5 tabs of painkillers did anything to help. If that keeps going Ill end up ruining my liver from taking painkillers, I will have to miss work and my holidays will be ruined. Not only this by Ill need a liver transplant if I keep taking this many painkillers. Im so tired of having problems with that tooth. \n\nNo amounts of paracetamol, naproxen or parcodin helps. I live in Iceland where laws regarding prescriptions are very tight so I dont even know if I could get anything stronger. \n\nShould I go to the hospital and try to get anything stronger? Is there anything stronger youd recommend knowing that it works well for that kind of pain? Any general suggestions? Im really desperate and idk what to do to stop the pain. \n\nThanks in advance.'"

hydrochlorothiazide,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical_advice/comments/10isde9/29f_chronic_pain_is_it_fibro_or_something_more/,b'29F Chronic pain - is it fibro or something more?',,"b'Okay, let me give a rundown of my relevant history: \n\nI\'m 29 F, I\'ve had this pain for as long as I could remember. \n\n[Edit for more context on my history: I\'m in the US, I am a white Jewish woman, age 29, weigh 350ish, 5\'3"", have been diagnosed with high blood pressure, fibromyalgia, depression, anxiety. Medical history includes mononucleosis, and pneumonia with a collapsed lung. I also have achy joints when I am still for a while.]\n\n[Edit 2 for more context on current meds: lamotrigine, ability, welbutrin, Cymbalta, Norvasc, bystolic, hydrochlorothiazide, Valsartan, vitamin D, magnesium glycenate, omeprazole. I smoke an ecig and recently am starting on Marijuana for my pain]\n\n[Edit 3 to include some blood work context too! For the last few years my blood has had consistently high white counts - mostly lymph but also neutrophils, high Sedimentation Rate, and extremely high c reactive protein]\n\nThe way I would describe it is hypersensitivity to touch. If I get poked or bumped in many (but not all) areas on my body, I feel pain for about two full minutes, to the level of feeling like someone punched me. (Areas include but are not limited to outside of upper arms, outside of ribs, back of calves).\n\nI also have similar pain that lasts about 2 weeks if I apply continuous pressure to almost any spot in my body, such as wearing tight boots/massaging a spot repetitively. This results in that spot being also hypersensitive to touch, but this lasts weeks at a time. \n\nI also have chronic fatigue, and my limbs tend to get tired very quickly, which makes brushing my hair or blowing it or even walking more than a block at a time extremely difficult. \n\nThese symptoms have been present for as long as I could remember, probably became aware that it wasn\'t normal back when I was 16 or so, maybe younger. \n\nThen there\'s this other pain that has me questioning my diagnosis of fibro. \n\nSee, I know that fibromyalgia is not progressive... but I have a pain symptom that is getting more frequent with time. \n\nThis pain is centered on my arms. I previously thought it was just my hands, but now I\'ve noticed (or it changed) that it goes up to my forearms as well. \n\nThis pain is extremely difficult to explain. All I could really describe is that it feels like my joints are extremely ""dry"", resulting in any movement causing deep sharp and radiating pain that lasts. \n\nI\'ve found that heat helps, so I bought myself some heated gloves and wear them when I have the pain, but overall it incapacitates me for 12-24 hours until it dissipates. \n\nIt usually starts early evening and keeps me up through the night, and fades by the next evening. \n\nRecently I\'ve noticed that I have an extremely tight knot in my forearm muscle as well, and my last time I experienced this pain I tried to massage it... it helped in the *moment* of massage, but the second I stopped the pain was back in force. All I managed to do was trigger my originally mentioned pain, which is finally fading now, a week later. \n\nI feel like the occurances of these ""spasms"" is getting more and more frequent. \n\nThere was a time I would have only one a year, but this month I had two in one week. \n\nThere\'s no predicting when this will happen. Initially I thought it was exertion related, but since then I\'ve noticed that there is no pattern. I only know that it\'s coming when it starts hurting. \n\nI think this kind of pain started around age 18? And it\'s been increasing in frequency almost exponentially. \n\nAnyway, I\'d appreciate any help, and I greatly thank you for reading this all. \n\nIs it fibro??? Am I crazy for being worried it\'s something else?'"
dilaudid,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/ko1167/full_summary_about_music_that_movie_by_sia/,"b'Full Summary about ""Music"" that movie by Sia'",,"b' This was originally written by u/isabellas123\n\n\\*\\*SPOILERS!! \\*\\* If you dont want spoilers do not read further.\n\nFirst off I would like to say that this is not Maddies fault she was only 14 at the time and trusted Sia.\n\nIn regards to the film plot. The movie is of course about an autistic teenager named Music. Although, apparently Sia never felt the need to actually refer to Music as Autistic in the film (unlike what shes done in every interview since filming, where she has told the world that the character is autistic) unfortunately in the movie Music is only referred to as someone who has special needs.\n\nThe very first scene of the movie shows Music in her underwear getting dressed, as she is moaning and hitting her legs with her fist. It is then followed by a music clip of Music dancing around, with the same faces and moves as seen in all of the Sia/Maddie music video. The next scene is where you first get to see Maddie act the role of Music as shes getting dressed in the morning. (To say it lightly the photos everyone saw of Maddie from the filming of the movie, is exactly what she does during the entire film). We see as her grandmother makes Music her smiley face eggs and braids her hair.\n\nAs the film continues Music goes on her daily walk around the neighborhood, where the neighbors assist her secretly as she does her walk to the library. When she comes back home her grandmother/only caretaker is on the floor, unconscious. She sits down where she normally sits kinda glancing at her and makes noises suggesting she is distressed about what she is seeing. The building owner knocks and comes in and finds music and her grandmother. He tries to comfort Music as she is moaning and becoming upset. He calls the police, and Music is left standing alone while her grandmothers body is wheeled out of the apartment.\n\nGoing on Zu gets told that she is going to have to take care of Music herself since she is all she has now. Zu moves into the apartment, where she was left alone, to take care of Music. That morning Zu is woken up by Music who is yelling and pulling on her to make you eggs, make you eggs so Zu tries to make Musics smiley face eggs. Music then wants Zu to braid your hair when Zu doesnt, Music begins to have a meltdown (the first of three I may add). Zu cant consult her and luckily Ebo, Leslie Odem Jr character, knocks on the door and then jumps on top of Music until she calms down.\n\nThe movie continues and we hear more about Zus life of being a sober drug dealer and more of Ebo who teaches at a gym. We also meet Felix, a young boy who is Musics neighbor and trains at the gym Ebo works at. Felix is always watching Music like they have a special bond, although Ebo and Music never actually communicate in anyway (this was so weird to me, he would just pop up in places watching her. It made me so uncomfortable). Ebo even flashes his flash light (from his room across the street) on Musics wall, illuminating her photos of dogs, where we see another one of Sias musical scenes of Music dancing with a human size dog. Maddie sings for this scene. *Felix has his own little story line in the film with a dramatic ending, but I wont touch on that*\n\nWe then go on another walk where Zu and Ebo talk about their lives and Ebo explains more about how Music thinks. (This is the scene where many of the paparazzi photos, weve seen, were taken) Music is walking behind them as many kids run by and she has her second meltdown of the film. As she runs around the park screaming and hitting her head. Zu and Ebo are trying to decide who should jump on her. Ultimately it ends up being Zu since Ebo said Im not jumping on top of a small screaming white girl in the middle of this park. So Zu jumps on top of Music as Ebo helps coach Zu on how to calm Music down. (This scene was captured in some of the paparazzi photos, also) Once the meltdown is over Zu get Music a rainbow snow cone.\n\nWe then see some scenes of Music and Zu bonding interweaved with some music scenes also including Ebo as he and Zu get closer. Theres also a scene of Edo playing the piano while Zu sings and Music listens and enjoys in the background.\n\nMoving on, Zu has a big job that she must go to (remember she is a sober drug dealer) and tries to find someone to watch Music. When she cannot find someone, Music comes to the job with her. In the elevator, up to the job, we see Zu and Music, where Zu is asking Music to try and not have one of your freak outs as she doesnt know these clients and wants to keep this job, so she wants Music to get it out now. The elevator lets them out on the set of photo shoot where Music begins to make loud nosies and heads for the set decorations, so Zu has to go sit her down. The photoshoot director then tells Zu that they need percocet, morphine, dilaudid, and oxycontin and once again Music is touching the set decorations and Zu must stop what shes doing to get Music. Once she gets Music to settle down we get to see who the photoshoot is for. Surprise surprise the shoot is for Sia! Shocker. Sia begins to scream DRUG DEALER, DRUG DEALER, are you the drug dealer. Zu heads to her and ask what she needs. Sia tells her the drugs they are buying are for charity work, and will be sent to Hadi because of an earthquake and kids need to have their bones put back together, but are only given Tylenol. So what ever Zu can get in by tomorrow, Sia will buy and fly them over there in her private jet. Pop Stars Without Borders is what Sia calls it. This scene is ended by Music getting into the wardrobe and we see another musical scene of her and Zu in crazy outfits dancing around. You can hear Maddie singing in this scene, as well.\n\nThen we go on another walk. While Zu is getting Music another rainbow snow cone, Music climbs under a bench and starts eating gum off of the bottom of it. Zu yells at her and then Music gets stung by a bee, where another meltdown occurs and theres screamed and hitting again. Music is ultimately allergic and Zu has to rush/carry her to the hospital. Zu is informed that Music had an EpiPen in the fanny pack that she should have used. Frustrated Zu realizes she left her backpack containing Sias drugs by the snow cone cart. She rushes back with Music (who although, after being in the hospital, and had a severe allergic reaction, which caused dramatic face swelling and redness, is perfectly fine/healed and walks back to the park just a little while later) and the drugs are no where to be found.\n\nAfter this Zu is over it. We see this as she decides to start using drugs again. Followed by another music scene if I remember corrected. The next scene we see Zu passed out on the couch with blood all over her face and is woken up by Music who walks in with a pee stain on the back of her pants because she wet the bed. Music gets cleaned up and heads out for her daily walk. Ebo comes in and finds out Zu relapsed which angers him and he leaves Zu.\n\nZu then decides she cant do it anymore. She needs to focus on herself before trying to take care of Music. Zu finds a facility for Music where Zu plans to leave her. They sit on the medical bed together and Music tells her to not go. They hold hands and then Zu comes to her senses so they bust out of there.\n\nZu heads to find Ebo. She finds him at his brothers wedding, she ask for forgiveness and says how much she needs him, and that shes going to be a better person. (along those terms) Then Ebo sits down to play the piano to sing the song they played earlier in the film, but as a surprise to them, as Ebo begins to play and Zu begins to sing. Music begins to sing the song. This scene ends with Music singing as Ebo plays.\n\nFinally, the film ends with them all together happy, as Zu is preparing Musics 3 eyed happy face eggs. Followed by the music video for Together as the credits roll.\n\n\n\nHere is my OPINION, if youre not interested in my opinion of this film do not read further. If you do not agree thats fine. This is only my opinion doesnt mean I am right. Other people can feel differently.\n\nOverall the film deserves every critique that its gotten. The character would have been much better played by someone, any where, on the spectrum. The dance scenes did not include any trained danced techniques, so Sia saying she needed someone who could dance is not only insulting, by thinking someone with autism couldnt do these simple dances, but also not the truth. The way Maddie plays the character is so offensive. Not only is it extremely stereotypical. The faces are nonstop, I mean nonstop. Constantly changing expressions, constantly moving neck. Mouth open, teeth out, mouth closed, eyes open, eyes close, touch tooth, touch fingers, hard blink, itch eye, stick out pout lip, look sideways. Look everywhere. Its this over and over again, in every scene. Also the fact that Maddie is known really hurts the character. Its just feels so wrong to watch Maddie try to play someone with this type of disability. There were times while watching Maddie that I was overwhelmed with emotion and it wasnt because the filmed touched me, it was because I felt like it was being portrayed so disrespectfully that it upset me. The film used autistic meltdowns three times as entertainment, which is absolutely disgusting. Not to mention they thanked autism speaks in the credits. Besides all the obvious, the storyline just isnt great either. Overall I would not recommend the film to anyone.'"

No one knows what is wrong with me, how to diagnose me or how to treat me. But they all agree something is very wrong. Originally they thought Lupus and then the ER said vasculitis. When I saw my GP on Friday he asked me what I had found on google and started taking notes.

I sometimes feel like the pain is generalized to a specific area like around my spleen or around my stomach. It will hurt worse if I touch the area. Sometimes it is full abdomen pain. During my last upper/lower I was told there was unexplained esophagus inflammation. I have had episodes of delayed gastric emptying with vomiting during these periods.\n\n-I get weird rashes on my arm if I go outside or get too hot. They are small round dots that turn in to open sores. They do not hurt or itch. They heal as white or purple marks. They just started last year.\n\n-I get swelling in the left half of my face and have very limited sensation in the left cheek. With this I get what I am guessing is swelling in my tongue that causes deviation. The tongue deviation being linked to swelling is just a guess and my personal guess. Doctors have no clue(I was originally told this was anxiety)\n\n-I get what feels like swelling in my inner ears. I feel and hear crunching and popping. Soon this pressure builds and I get feelings of being lightheaded, dizzy, smelling burning, vision changes, and cognitive decline. \n\n-I get pain and stiffness in my neck, wrists, fingers and toes.

Countless doctors/specialists and all of them are stumped.',Image905.jpg,"b'Hi there, kinda at my wits end here so thought it couldn\'t hurt to post and see if anyone had any insights on this one. It\'s a bit of a saga so I\'ll try to make it concise as possible.  \n\n\nIn 2017 I got the mother of all sinus infections. It \'cleared up\' after a bout of nasal steroids and a week in bed but ever since I was left with dark blue rings on the inside of my eyes (pic below), near constant zapping pins-and-needles around the same area and my forehead and near constant post nasal drip. That same year I had eight courses of antibiotics with no effect.  \n\n\nIn 2018 an ENT took one look at me and put me under the knife with a septoplasty and turbinate reduction surgery. Symptoms remained.  \n\n\nIn 2019 I saw an allergist who said I was mildly allergic to rye grass which was followed by a year of immunotherapy injections. No change. Later saw a second allergist who reported I wasn\'t allergic to anything.  \n\n\nThe same year I saw another ENT for a second opinion who thoroughly examined my sinuses, looked at my bloodwork along with a catscan and concluded everything was A-ok and whatever was going on was definitely NOT sinus related. He hypothesised I might have a condition called Midfacial Segment Pain Syndrome - a \'poorly understood condition\'. He put me on 150mg Amitriptyline which helped with the pins and needles slightly but post nasal drip remained.  \n\n\n2020 - I was referred to a neurologist who did an MRI and concluded my brain was in \'pristine condition\'. She referred me to a pain specialist.  \n\n\n2021 - The pain specialist performed pulsed radiofrequency on the nerves around my sinus and forehead area. This went someway to stop the zapping, pins-and-needles sensation but the post nasal drip is still worse than ever.  \n\n\nAside from the Midfacial Segment Pain Syndrome diagnosis, the pain specialist explained the most likely cause of this issue by the swelling from the initial sinus infection damaging the nerves around the site of the infection causing neuralgia (which makes the most sense so far). The concerning thing though was that when I asked him if that\'s the cause of the constant post nasal drip and rhinitis he said quite confidently that it was not.  \n\n\nSo while the pins-and-needles have died down somewhat, the dark blue rings around the interior of my eyes remains and I\'m going still going through a box of tissues every few days from the constant rhinitis.  \n\n\nAnyway! That\'s my tale of woe. Any replies would be massively appreciated.  \n\n\nDetails:  \nAge: 37  \nSex: Male  \nHeight & Weight: 186cm / 88kg (6\'1"" / 194lbs)  \nRace: Caucasian  \nLocation: Melbourne, Australia  \nCurrent medications: Cymbalta 60mg, once a day (Duloxetine)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d598jjey9e4a1.jpg?width=2043&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1191f89e6da92f4f229dfd850b694e8d08639ddc'"

bactrim,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/rtk5c/the_difference_between_a_rash_and_the_rash/,"b'The difference between A rash, and THE rash '",,"b'I thought this might be helpful since I\'ve seen some questions come up in regards to ""the rash"" that can happen from meds like Lamictal. A few years back I chatted on another bi-polar forum and it was a common question - how do I know if the rash I have is THE rash? \n\nHaving had THE rash, I would like to share some photos and answer questions if anyone has them. A lot of medical professional don\'t even know how to spot or treat the rash (which isn\'t really a RASH per se, it\'s the start of a condition called Steven Johnson Syndrome) and not everyone who gets a rash will go on to have SJS - they are 2 different reactions. \n\nHere, in photos, is waht it looks like. I find this to be helpful since a lot of photos out there of SJS show it in it\'s later stages, not when it first forms.\n\n[My arm, day 1](http://i.imgur.com/Qj3iU.jpg)\n\n[My mouth, day 2](http://i.imgur.com/mLKII)\n\n[My back, day 3](http://i.imgur.com/qnwWC.jpg)\n\n[My mouth, day 3](http://i.imgur.com/WfIUS)\n\n[My mouth, day 4](http://i.imgur.com/Z68Cr.jpg)\n\nAfter that it just gets worse, like the typical photos of SJS you see online. The rash is fast growing, and even with stopping the medication you have to just let the reaction run it\'s course. The biggest tip off that it\'s SJS and not just a rash is that your mouth and nose are affected right away - the skin in them are one of the first to start dying and falling off, so you develop a really awful taste and bad breath. Second tip is that the rash HURTS. I\'m not just talking painful itching rash, but like 3rd degree burns. By the end of the first few days of the rash, it will become very clear that you\'re not just fighting a rash, but something more. It\'s VERY IMPORTANT (I can not stress this enough) that at the first signs of a rash, you call your doctor ASAP, and if you start showing signs of it progressing that you get yourself to a hospital immediately.\n\noh and if anyone is curious what I normally look like, with out the swelling and marks, LOL here\'s me [Normally..](http://i.imgur.com/0QhEp.jpg)\n\n\neta - I\'m not posting this to scare anyone away from their medication, but to ease peoples worries about the rash. SJS is very rare - about 6-7 in a million get SJS, and it can be caused by hundreds of different medications. However, having said that, for some unknown reason certain medications - like lamictal - tend to have a higher rate of SJS/TENS than other medications. The only other medication that has a higher rate is sulfa based antibiotics like bactrim. Not everyone who has a rash from medication like Lamictal will go on to getting SJS, but there are signs to look for so you can get treatment right away. I just wanted to let everyone here know, because no one warned me. I was told to watch for a rash, everyone mentions a rash, but no one talks about the fact that it\'s not JUST a rash. '"

After a fever, I developed itchy and irritating palm rashes (I'm guessing from my research) on the palms of my hands and soles of my feet. I've had hives from apparent allergies before but they usually weren't red and they'd patch up along my arms and legs, not soles of my feet and palms of my hands. I do not have a history of eczema. \n\nAnother thing is that I've been in remission for JRA for 10 years and had a scary thought I was relapsing because it felt like my fingertip joints and toes were boiling. However, the pain isn't as intense (though it could eventually get there) and I never developed these red spots over my soles and palms; it was rashes along my knees and arms. \n\nDay 1: I had a fever with migraines, sore throat, and fatigue throughout the day. Barely ate anything so had a loss of apetite than usual. I took Advil but woke up frequently throughout the night because of small discomfort in my hands and feet. \n\nDay 2: Fever went away, but my throat felt like there's a lump in it. Swallowing liquid and any type of food hurt but I didn't have much of an appetite anyway. Overtime throughout the day, the joint tips of my fingers started to feel a bit of pain and noticed two red dots on my palms. I was itching but I wasn't terribly itchy as I do with hives. \n\nDay 3 (Today): Same as day 3 but much worse! My hands and feet feel like they're on fire (mildly itchy but as if they need attention) -- more red bumps have formed. I can't sleep because my feet become overwhelmingly sweaty. Throat still hurts every time I digest any food or liquid.\n\nI will be seeing a doctor but not for a while due to some insurance stuff figured out but just wanted to know what this could be. """
corticosteroid rash,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/4v14p0/psa_i_had_never_heard_this_before/,b'PSA: I had never heard this before...',,"b""I had a flair up of my allergies last night.  No idea what set them off.  It started as a small rash on one of my calves.  No biggie put on some hydrocortisone cream... didn't work.  So I dug out my big guns, prescription steroid cream... didn't work.  What the hell...  So I took 50mg Benadryl.  An hour and a half later, the symptoms were spreading, and I had a rash/hives all over both of my legs, my face was swelling, and I was itchy all over.  Took another dose of 50mg of Benadryl.  When that didn't work an hour later, I headed to the ER.  They gave me IV benadryl, steroids, and Pepcid (didn't realize that it has anti-inflammatory properties, but evidently it does).  Itching and hives were brought under control, YAY!\n\nBut here's my PSA:  The doctor told me because I take daily allergy medicine (Zyrtec-antihistamine and Flonase-local corticosteroid), and the Zyrtec is an antihistamine, it can undermine the effectiveness of Benadryl (a stronger antihistamine), which is likely why the Benadryl I took at home didn't stop the reaction.  Just wanted to let others know!\n\n**TL;DR:  If you are on a daily antihistamine and have an acute allergy attack, Benadryl may be less effective due to already having antihistamines in your system!**"""
effexor,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzodiazepines/comments/9x2qrr/benzodiazepine_rebound_anxiety_before_being/,b'Benzodiazepine rebound anxiety before being prescribed klonopin and Effexor er.',,"b'So to start I have had anxiety since I was 8 years old panic attacks and all. It wasnt until I was 16 that I was given my first Xanax not prescribed 1mg, and for the first time I was able to feel completely fine, but being so young I was irresponsible and ended up taking them daily getting myself dependent without knowing what being dependent on a drug was like. I started obsessively reading forums about withdrawals from this shit and started freaking myself out. I was trying so hard to self medicate for my anxiety I would try and use klonopin to help with Xanax withdrawal which since I was doing on my own fucked me up even more. I went through some pretty fucking rough withdrawal, shaking vomiting insane anxiety worse then before. After that I stopped taking them went to the doctor about my anxiety didnt mention any benzo use and got prescribed Zoloft starting at 25mg worked up to 100mg and 125 mg Wellbutrin. The combo made me extremely numb and depressed and I still had the anxiety from before just not as bad, but the depression really sucked. Eventually I had some really bad stuff happen in my life had to move in with different family who gave me so much shit about taking my prescribed Zoloft and Wellbutrin that I eventually quit Wellbutrin cold turkey and tapered down to 50mg Zoloft and quit right there at that dose without a doctors help stupid I know. So its been a little under a year since I quit taking my medicine. I am 18 now and I have started taking Xanax and klonopin again to self medicate not both at the same time but I would take which ever one I had. I decided this self medication shit was enough and its only making things worse because I am now dependent on benzos again not extremely dependent but to the point where if I dont take a benzo every night I can feel the rebound anxiety begin to escalate and it scares the shit out of me because all this talk of seizures and stuff. I have kept my doses fairly low never over 2mg I usually only need about .5mg Xanax or klonopin to make feel OK. Keep in my mind that Im not taking this shit recreationally Im taking it to help my own symptoms not just to get fucked up. Yesterday I went to the doctor and told her my anxiety is out of control and Im having panic attacks. I got prescribed 30 .5mg klonopin and Effexor ER starting at 35mg working up to 75mg. So I need advice. The Effexor er scares the hell out of me so Im hesitant to take it because all of the horror stories about side effects and the klonopin Im using on an as needed basis but because of my past benzo use I cant tell what is a normal panic attack and what is withdrawal. I dont want to take my prescribed klonopin just to stop withdrawal because I know thats just making that problem worse. Any advice would be great this is my first time posting on reddit but I read about this type of shit all the time and I wanna see what people have to think about my situation. I also smoke weed daily and its just making the anxiety worse right now when it use to make it better. '"

I'm in my early 30's. I never thought i might have ADHD (even though ive always struggled with focus and just excused it as my personality, even though my highschool teachers wanted me tested because I would get high test scores but always be the last to finish, my mom refused at the time and i forgot about it) until i tried a friends vyvanse (just one 70mg). They suggested I try it when I described my focus, extreme daytime sleepiness (i used to be able to drink a monster energy or 2 and still be tired enough for a nap), and motivation problems. She said she had the same problems.   \n\n\nIt was the first time I was able to get through a whole day of work and not be sleepy or distracted or stuck staring at a wall which is super important because my job is essentially content creating and my money depends on my work ethic  however I didn't know how it worked and took it really late in the day, Like 5pm with an energy drink so I was up till the morning the next day, lasted at least 14 hours. She had also gave me one Adderall (20MG) to try which i took a week later to try (even though i think she takes them together) which my body did not take well to, had headaches, spacey, heart racing and the focus was not sufficient at all.  After that it took me a year to finally get the diagnosis from a neuropsychologist and coverage for vyvanse.  \n\n\nSo I started on 30MG, and the first days were awful. I didn't experience a crash like this before so it was unexpected. After only 3 hours I was feeling extreme depression, and 8 hours after my anxiety spiked (so bad my chest felt tight) and it just didn't last long enough (only 3 hours active time tops). It also didn't keep me awake, I took one 30MG one day and was able to sleep through the entire active time.  I need at least 8 hours of productivity and no daytime sleepiness. So I doubled the dose (2 30MG/60MG at once) and that lasted the 8 hours actively I needed almost exactly (not including the 2 hours for it to kick in)  and I had no depression side effects or very very mild by bedtime. I also had no anxiety spikes on this dose. , but I had trouble getting to sleep at night, even though I was taking it around 10:30am and stopped caffeine (protein coffee only, i no longer drink energy drinks) intake before 5pm. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(also keep in mind, i'm not taking it daily. I actually have about 8 30MG pills left. I hate the idea of being dependent on medication... I barely even take tylenol or advil unless the pain is unbearable and I have diagnosed anxiety after 2 panic attacks put me in the hospital but refused to refill my zoloft because I hated how I felt on it even though it worked. I've been able to mitigate my anxiety with breathing techniques and my dogs, i don't have anxiety everyday, only when dealing with a lot. So I really only want to take it for content days which require the most work and focus and days I want to be really active with my son like take him out somewhere and be attentive to him)\n\nCurrent problem:\n\nSo i asked my Dr to maybe give me slightly less than 60MG to try and he prescribed me 50MG. Well this is my first day taking it, took it at 10:30am with no coffee close to taking it and by 4:30 I noticed it basically worn off. So that's only an active time of 4 hours for me. I have only gotten half of what I needed to do today done. :(   I just drank a protein coffee at 4:30pm when I felt it starting to wear off so I'm not tired now, but most of the focus and motivation is gone. I don't understand how the 10mg could make that drastic of a difference. I also didn't feel the boost in energy as much as I did on the 60mg.  \n\n\nSo I'm wondering is it because I didn't drink my protein coffee closer to the dose like I did before (when i took the 60mg, i would drink my protein coffee exactly 2-3 hours after taking it) or can 10mg really make a huge difference? I have had break days between, sometimes multiple days in between so I don't think its dependence that fast. Or maybe because I didn't eat anything until the 4:30 protein coffee shake? Or maybe because I just didn't get much sleep last night?   \n\n\nI read on here that some people take boosters, but I'd really rather not take additional medications and don't know if I will be covered for double doses of smaller amounts (plus i'm really bad about taking meds on time).

cialis,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/yz80mq/partial_erection_and_low_libido/,b'Partial erection and low libido',,"b""Hi, sorry for bad English , this is translate by Google. I'm 25 years old, I've been training at the gym since I was 18 - usually 3x a week, additionally I run once a week. The supplements I have used so far are: creatine, proteine supplements and pre-workouts. I don't drink or smoke, and I've never taken steroids. I eat healthy. Since I was a child I had health problems. I have been suffering from headaches  for years. Plus, since I started farming sex (18 years old) I have problems with erection. Not that I don't have it at all (it was the first two times - stress) . It's just weak and hard for me to achieve, so I usually have sex with an incomplete erection (60-70%), Same with masturbation morning erection also of poor quality for years. In addition, sometimes literally seconds after erection it starts to losem hardness. It doesn't matter if I AM alone or with a girlfriend, I just want change the position and I lost my erection. I've also had low libido for years  and I often have no desire for sex, I am often tired. I've been to several doctors as a kid, nothing it came out bad. In 2017, I started my examinations again, I visited a urologist and a neurologist (everything was fine), but at the endocronologist I had prolactin 2x above the norm, then in the hospital I had a MRI ( tumor wasn't detected), then  next prolactin check was normal, the rest of the hormones too. After that, I didn't go to the doctor for 5 years. In the meantime, I tried various preparations myself, e.g. Ashwagandha, Tribullus, Maca root, zinc + arginine( here a slight improvement), and sildenafil and tadalafil (the best for me,  in most situations I can normally have sex). This year, on September 2, I went to the hospital, fainted and had a heart attack.Same day After a few tests they let me out of the hospital and I started going to the doctors again and getting tested. It turned out that I have high blood pressure. I've been taking high blood pressure medication since September 20. First I got RAMIPRIL  2.5 mg, after 3 weeks the 5mg dose and now the third week I am on Ramipril 5mg + Amlodipine 5mg . I feel great, my head stop hurts  (previously I had a headache at least once a week, and sometimes 2-3 times a week). I really feel a huge improvement in my daily functioning. As for erections it's a little easier for me to achieve it, and morning erections are more frequent but it's still all of poor quality and I still have a low libido. Since taking these drugs for high blood pressure, I managed to achieve a full erection 4-5 times with woman, but it still doesn't work as it should.I'm getting tired of this, I need help. I would like to have normal sex and not on cialis or viagra. Now I will present to you the results of my research since the hospital. I've been to the family doctor (he said I have high blood pressure), two cardiologists (heart is fine, echocardiography fine, hypertension-drugs), neurologist(neurologically fine, hypertension) and endocrinologist(fine, hypertension). In the hospital: ECG 50/min(good), Computer Tomograph of the head fine, blood pressure 150/90. Most research blood tests fine, only Glucose 110[60-99], Creatinine 1.24[0.70-1.20]. After the hospital: a few days later, morphology blood test fine, urine fine, creatinine 1.10[0.8-1.30] and eGFR >60. Then Cholesterol 135[120-190], Cholesterol HDL 35.60 [40-60], LDL cholesterol 100, Triglycerides 88 [30-150], Glucose 93.3 [74-99], HbA1c 5.5% [4,8-6]. Further tests: TSH 2.98 [0.35-4.94], Creatinine 1.11 [0.70-1.30], Prolactin 304.85 [72.66-407.40], Testosterone 570.09 [47.01-980.56], FSH 3.10 [1.50-12.40], LH 5.87 [1.70-8.60], Estradiol 32.70 [11.30-43.20], Progesterone 0.57[<0.05-0.149], ACTH 62[7.20-63.30], Cortisol 20.70[4.82-19.5] and vitamin D 32.80 [30-50 optimal concentration]. Latest research now from early November: Fasting Prolactin 376.37 [72.66-407.40], Prolactin after MCP: 2511.39 mlU/l. Revised Cortisol 19.80[4.82-19.5] and ACTH 71.70[7.20-63.30] plus DHEA 11.30[1.70-6.10]. All these results were recently seen by an endocronologist and he did not find any hormonal abnormalities, what do you think? I'm curious about this prolactin, because it has been with me for years so elevated, the symptoms also match (low libido, fatigue, etc.) that's why I plan to supplement with Vitamin B6 in the form of P5P in the near future to check my body's reaction to it possible lowering of prolactin and then, if necessary, go to another endocrinologist.I would like to add that in January I am enrolled in the hospital for an MRI of the pituitary gland"""

In February I was also diagnosed for ADHD and been on dexamphetamine 4x12.5 mg a day (Amfexa, it's called Tentin in the Netherlands) ever since. The medication really helped me, although it did increase some psychical anxiety symptoms. \n\nNow recently my anxiety has been increasing a lot, and I finally decided that it would be time to try citalopram. I am starting psychotherapy in a month, and my psychologist suggested that it would be benefiticial to start a combination of dex and the SSRI together with the therapy itself. \n\nNow, I am very hesistant and anxious to try citalopram as I rarely read any experiences of similar stimulant + SSRI combinations. Furthermore, drug interactions online mention that it is not possible to combine a stimulant and SSRI, even though multiple psychologists and two psychiatrists keep telling me that it is possible.. ? Therefore, I would really appreciate it to hear some fellow ADHD'-ers with the combination of stimulants and SSRI for OCD/anxiety. Is there a reason for me to be so anxious, especially about the side effects? I am just terrified that my OCD or anxiety will increase even more and spiral out of control. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSidenote: My psychiatrist said that I should try 2 mg of citalopram for 2-3 days, and increase by 2 mg every 2-3 days until 20 mg to minimize the side effects.

dexilant,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pjvme/nightmares_and_daydreams_are_getting_out_of/,"b""nightmares and daydreams are getting out of control. I don't know if this is normal. """,,"b""Here is a quick synopsis of myself and my situation: \n(or, at least. I will try to make it quick.) \n\n\n>And please, please comment. I see upvotes, for which I am appreciative of. Please help by sending me a message or something. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The short version:\n I have a history of depression and some night terrors. Recently,  nightmares have started happening again, and are now bleeding into the daytime, which has never happened. My daydreams consist of myself getting hurt, and begging for someone to care for me. Sometimes they do. Other times, I am a caretaker, trying to save someone from dying after a car accident, etc. Does this happen to anyone else? How can I get out of this? I legitimately feel as though I cant stop dreaming. *\n\nThe long version: \nI am a 22 yr old female. I recently moved over 2,000 miles to live with my boyfriend, leaving behind family and friends. Moving is not a big deal to me, considering my military kid background, moving every 2 years as I grew up. I am introverted, and extremely creative (I write, sing, draw, paint, play instruments, act, garden, design... you name it, I do it.) I have a history of depression, and have attempted suicide twice in the last 5 years. Currently, the only medication I am taking is Dexilant, to slow down the acid production in my stomach... I am living with a condition that is rare for my age called a hiatal hernia. It causes severe heartburn and restricts my diet. I have dealing with this and the pain from it for one year. I sometimes have severe esophageal spasms, which mimics the pain of having a heart attack. There is nothing anyone can do... I  just have to sit through it. \n\nI was recently fired from a job, where I was poorly treated. The management often yelled at employees, picked at their personal home life, and put them down. They were understaffed, and everyone was overworked. It was not uncommon to see co-workers crying in the bathroom, or working for over 12 hours straight. Firing was probably the best thing they ever could have done for me, but I have never been fired before, and it was very hard on me. I am a very quick learner and put my back into my work, so to have that happen was devastating. I am now unemployed, and trying to seek unemployment from the government, though there is a very high chance I will not receive it, considering I was fired. \n\nI have turned my efforts to finding something non-stressful, and am now working on becoming a massage therapist because I enjoy helping, and calming people. I have this ability, and most of friends come to me for it when upset or stressed. I start school again in march, and will be a licensed massage therapist in the next year. After that, once I secure a good job, I want to go back to school again to become a nurse and care for the sick. \n\n\n\nHere is my problem... I daydream. A lot. It does not interfere with a lot of things; I can usually stop whenever I need to. I usually can choose what to daydream about as well, and then sort of get sucked into it while I'm cooking, or something. Recently, however, I can't stop. I have been  trying to become employed again, and when I am not doing that, I do some calligraphy in my notebook, or exercise (I am learning to become a hoop dancer). If I am not moving about or doing something - if I pause for even a second - I am sucked back into something. Usually they consist of myself getting hurt, and bleeding. Or someone beside me dying, and I'm trying to save them. There is an overwhelming feeling of sorrow. Sometimes, if I start to feel sleepy while Im drawing or listening to music, I feel as though someone is speaking to me very softly. I am about to answer them when I sort of wake up and realize I am completely alone in my apartment. Its creeping me out. Most of the time the voices are very kind, however. \n\nI should probably also add that I have a history of night terrors. They plagued me for about 3 months in the fall of 2008... to the point where I was exhibiting symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. My weight dropped drastically and I would go for days without sleeping, for fear of having another dream. A couple times I collapsed out of sheer exhaustion and friends would help me. To this day, I still cannot speak of some of the horrors I was subjected to. When I woke, usually shouting.. even though my eyes were open, and I was sitting up, I could still see it. I would swear to you the bloodstain was there on the wall, or that the face was hovering outside the window, etc, etc.  \n\nI have parents who do not 'believe' in psychology and either thought I needed to spend more time with God, or that I was making it up to get attention. Most of the time they did not seem to notice that I didn't eat or sleep. I don't really know if they cared much. If they heard me talking on the phone past 9pm (usually to a friend because I was scared) they would come in and take my phone for a couple days and ground me from playing piano, reading, or sometimes even leaving the house. \n\nHaving a history of depression, I started to cut while having night terrors. Nothing big, just long thin scratches on the top of my fore-arm, or around my legs. Sometimes I would cut into my hips. It was never for attention - I never showed them to anyone, and was very careful to not be seen with them. I do not scar easily. But it felt good, like I was releasing some of the tension I had built up. \n\nThis behavior showed up again with my last job, that I was fired from. After being screamed at, and given 3 days worth of work and expected to finish it in 3 hours... I took a paperclip and started digging it into my hands and arms until I started to bleed. I had my own cubicle, so no one saw, and again, I kept it covered. I wanted to sob, and go home, but I couldn't. \n\nTo be honest, I feel like cutting a little now. I have been feeling this way for days. I am sorely tempted to, because it feels good to me. I just dont want my boyfriend to freak out. I do not hide anything from him, and dont want him to be concerned or feel sad. He works very hard, and we love each other very much. \n\nI saw a psychologist while having the night terrors, who was rubbish. She literally suggested I burn some sage in my bathroom, so I will feel safe from any demons who were in my house. I left after 3 sessions. \n\nFast forward 2 years, and my boyfriend moves away for a job offer. I want to move with him, and start a new life, but I needed to complete my degree and finish up some loose ends with my parents. Just before I moved, I started seeing pschologist and psychiatrist who both diagnosed me with depression and anxiety problems. I was prescribed a number of things, all of which made me completely miserable, or aggravated the situation. I never responded to anything positively, and frankly, dont wish to try again. I can give you the list and the dosage of what I was taking, if you are curious. \n\nSo basically, my question is. Are the daydreams I am experiencing now just a product of anxiety, due to the new environment, the stress of the lost job, etc, etc? Why am I having such terrible nightmares again? Why are they carrying though the day? Why cant I stop daydreaming about horrible things? I am relatively healthy  I exercise, I eat very well, and Im about 10 lbs underweight so why does my whole body feel so crappy? Is this normal? \nIts like all I want is for someone really soothing to sort of take care of me. To brush my hair, and put me to sleep, and tell me over and over again that I am safe, and that everything is okay.  I hear music all the time. I cant stop daydreaming this, and sometimes find myself weeping. I am an adult, and am very capable of caring for myself, and caring for others, but I cant seem to get away from this motif, or this sorrow that hangs around me. \n\nAny ideas? \nPlease. \n\n\n**TLDR: I daydream freaky stuff excessively and can't find a way to stop, despite several attempts. Let me know if this happens to you too, or if there is a way to snap out of it. I feel as though its driving me mad. **\nI see upvotes, but no comments. Please help."""

I am a clean and hygienic person and use fresh towels, one for face only one for body, I wash my sheets and pillow-cases regularly, and do my best to avoid touching my face throughout the day. I was always baffled by my recurring problem and assumed others were misjudging my condition as a biproduct of sloth and uncleanliness. \n\nYears of dermatologist appointments racked up costly bills as well as exposure to extremely powerful medications that I naively took in good faith from a doctor. In truth, my dermatologist was a Rx pusher and his friendly demeanor his effective sales-tool of deception. After having poor results (red flaky skin) with Rx topicals such as benzoyl peroxide, differin, duac and clindamycin, I was routed toward using Rx pills such as Minocycline, Doxycycline, and Tetracycline in conjunction with the topicals. Every time I changed antibiotics my skin improved for a few weeks before rapidly deteriorating into scar-inducing cystic breakouts. \n\nIn 2004 at my dermatologist\'s recommendation went on my first regimen of Accutane. I read the labels and warnings but was assured only a small percentage of patients ever experience these side-effects and that the drug was ""pretty much"" guaranteed to work. That half-hearted promise combined with the fact that every other treatment had failed led me to believe Accutane was to be my salvation. I\'ve known people who truly benefitted from the drug but I want to share how it effected me. Within a few weeks my skin became dry and red, my scalp itchy, my joints ached, my eyes jaundiced and I experienced irregular sleep patterns as well as periods of manic depression. Did I tell anyone? No. Why? I was going to tough it out to FINALLY defeat my acne and the anxiety that came with it. I had regular blood work and was told everything checked out, that my side effects were normal. Anyway, after 5 months of soul-draining exposure to the drug, my skin was worse than before the treatment. The acne coverage was about the same, but my skin was thin and weak, hypersensitive, red, blotchy, and constantly dry.\n\n I went back to my usual regimen of a gentle wash and wallowed in self pity for over a year, never really improving, having ""o.k. days"" and ""terrible weeks"" before my dermatologist recommended a fourth course of antibiotics to prevent further scarring. They failed again. After that I entered my picking phase, where on some primal level I was determined to kill the condition myself if the medications couldnt. The subsequent scarring and lack of progress is still regrettable to this day. So I found myself sitting, slouched and defeated flipping through random magazines in the dermatologist\'s waiting rooms listening to the pages flip-over without reading a word, feeling broken. At that point I would have dunked my face in an acid bath and hid in a cave for a year if I could emerge blemish free but instead was misguided to a regimen far worse. A second round of Accutane. \n\nThis time the dermatologist had concrete numbers for me, 80% success rate for second course users he said. Four months later I found myself standing on a second story balcony with a belt around my neck thinking about how my skin was still going to look pock-marked inflamed, and mangled during an open casket ceremony. I\'m not a religious person, so instead of thanking God, I thank the cheap manufacturing process that caused the belt to snap at the buckle on the way down. It is also important to say that this was undoubtedly the most selfish thing I have ever done. I hit the ground and kneed myself in the jaw. Spitting blood I thought of all the people I would have heart and all the painful questions they\'d be asking, likely to arrive at the wrong conclusion. A few months before I was a witty, engaged and humorous person, aware of my physical eyesores, upset by them, but not self-loathing by any means. Granted on my first course of Accutane I\'d have moments where I felt really down but the magnitude of depression and the destructive, neurotic introspection I experienced during my second course led me to live a quiet secluded life of hermitage and hopelessness. \n\nI haven\'t told anyone I know about this struggle and the severity of my own actions and I thank this forum and its members for giving me the courage to discuss it and I implore others to seek out someone to talk to if they find themselves as wayward as I was. Also, be mindful of your peers and reach out to help others if you notice a change in someone\'s demeanor and habits, which may not be so sudden or apparent. I was really good at lying about how ""okay"" I was just to get people to stop asking questions and leave me alone. It\'s not an easy thing to trust someone with a personal strife and sometimes making the first contact can save a life. \n\nThe battle continues...\n\nAfter picking myself up off the ground, both metaphorically and literally, I decided I was done with prescription medications and stopped taking Accutane immediately. I then began a passionate pursuit of vitamins, minerals, and natural health supplements. I was convinced the problem was internal (where else could this pus, inflammation, and gunk be coming from) and also realized if my wounds and scars were going to heal efficiently I needed to create the ideal nutrient climate in my system. I started with a high protein, high-fiber, high anti-inflammatory/alkaline diet combined with tons of water (with lemon juice) and exercise and gradually moved towards supplementing with additional items. I also recognized that I broke out worse after taking long hot showers or eating certain foods the days before, specifically high-yeast and high-sugar content foods/beverage and cheeses. \n\nI started experimenting, altering every fews months to allow for effective courses with various regimens including Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc, Copper, Vitamin D, Potassium, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, Selenium, DMAE, Cod-Liver Oil, Probiotics, Biotin, and other B-Complexes. I want to note that it is very very important to hydrate diligently and refrain from excessive use of alcohol when taking a hefty supplement load as it can strain your liver and kidneys. I know in college it is difficult to refrain from alcohol altogether so drink A LOT of water throughout the day. Be sure to take the vitamins and supplements at the appropriate time of day and with water or with food as directed. Throwing down a heap of all of them at once is not advised as they react with each other. The result, my skin improved, my energy levels rose and my wounds healed more quickly but I was still experiencing breakouts, though less severe, and rarely anymore forthcoming cystic acne (some deep knots still slumbered under layers of tissue.) I also still had occasional flare-ups and they were almost always isolated to my cheeks, nose, brow, and behind my ears. \n\nI maintained that strategy for a few years but still would wake up every morning to at least one or two new whiteheads and a scattering of blackheads on my nose and brow, and incurred a few scars here and there that deceptively add up over time. Where was this gunk coming from? I knew that I was still missing something and my obsession with ""solving"" the problem led to unwarranted picking again of tiny comedones and milia which sometimes became inflamed and larger because of my prying. I also tried natural topicals such as tea tree oil, manuka oil,manuka honey, lavender oil, baking soda, castor packs and ice baths and though wound healing and recovery time was expedited, the underlying cause was still at work. \n\nThen in a collision of coincidences I made my discovery. It was a combination of reviewing a copy of my medical records which noted several ear infections as a child. While I was sick with a sinus infection I studied the anatomy of sinus passages and discovered chronic sinusitis is actually a yeast infection/candida overgrowth. This can be worsened by long term effects of exposure to antibiotics. Drumroll please....the literal and figurative underlying cause to my chronic acne was my sinuses!\n\nI realized when looking at a diagram of sinus passages that the most prevalent breakout regions on my face were directly above/surrounding my sinuses. My cheeks, nose, brow, temples, behind my ears/neck. I found myself excitedly asking, could I have developed a resistant infection (possibly gram negative/yeast combo + allergy aggravated) in my sinuses that stubbornly resided at varying capacities depending on the strength of my immune system (i.e. flare ups during flu-season / better skin in summer when swimming in/accidentally inhaling ocean salt water) Was this my eureka moment?\n\nI immediately went to the store and bought a ""Neil Med"" sinus rinse set (there are other kinds but this one gives you the ability to slightly pressurize the flow of the solution) which included the non-iodized salt and baking soda packets. Using filtered water I started the process. Much to my dismay I expelled heaps of dark green and brown sludge from deep within my sinus cavities over the next two days. Followed by three days of yellow goo. Followed by a mixed clear/yellow/chunky debris and then nothing but the cleaning solution itself. The result, I honestly felt blessed, like I had taken and extended bath in a Lazarus pit. Not only could I breathe better then ever (didnt really notice impaired breathing before due to the chronic nature of the problem) I could hear better, smell better, taste finer notes of foods, speak more clearly with deeper resonance, and slept like a hibernating bear. I combined that two time a day rinse regimen (three to start) with a Yeast-Fighters supplement. The supplement contains a Fiber Blend (psyllium husk, guar gum, apple pectin, chitosan) Lactobacilus Acidophilus, Garlic Bulb Extract, Herbal Extract Blend (pau d\'arco bark, onion bulb, golden seal, echinacea, black walnut seed) and Caprylic Acid. \n\nOverall result of this ten year investigative and perilous journey has been a success. I can feel my skin beginning to normalize, breakouts have ceased (except for the slow rise of some ancient deposits) I no longer have inflammation and my oil production has returned to a proper functioning status. I continue with the sinus rinse occasionally and still take a vitamin regimen, lots of water, and exercise. When I do get an occasional pimple or exhumed residual cyst I take a warm shower, carefully extract the core (only when ready) then ice the area or run cold water over my face for a few minutes. I then pat dry and apply tea tree and lavender oils as a spot treatment.\n\nAs for the scarring of old, I have found another super-product. Rosehip seed oil. It is an extremely lightweight oil, thinner in viscosity than jojoba and a retinol, high in Vitamin A, C, E and essential fatty acids(linoleic, linolenic, oleic, palmitic, and stearic.) I use it for both overnight spot treatment mixed with lavender oil and as a moisturizer for dry patches as I find it to be non-comedogenic and readily absorbed by the skin. It has a pleasant and subtle woodsy aroma. I\'ve noticed that the darker its tint the more effective it is. I usually apply a few drops to my fingers, pat onto slightly damp skin (better to ice/cool your face beforehand to increase effectiveness) allow to soak in for a few minutes then gently pat/blot the excess oil. I cannot express how grateful I am for this product and its effectiveness. As a retinoid, the oil can aggravate existing acne and should not be used over the entire face everyday. Remember, the healing will take time.\n\nWell it appears my story here has come to an end, I hope this reaches and helps as many people as possible so spread the word! I wish I had solved this years ago but the journey of battling this affliction has made me a stronger and more understanding person, not judging others by their appearance nor assuming causalities. I would be glad to answer any question you might have whether they pertain to the content of this post or something unrelated. Thank you for your time and keeping this valuable supportive community alive.\n'"

She went to the dermatologist and was prescribed Retin-A gel 0.25%. With the Retin-A, her acne got worse. I encouraged her to continue using it, explaining that it is common to purge when first starting Retin-A. By the third month, my daughter went from persistent acne to severe acne fully covering her face. It was so hard for her to deal with this. It seemed to be more than a purge and more like she was having a very adverse reaction to Retin-A.\n\nAlong with the extreme acne, she started to develop lots of scarring so we sent photos to her Derm who took her off Retin-A and prescribed Bactrim along with Epiduo (Adpalene and Benzoyl Peroxide). She started the Bactrim but was reluctant/afraid to continue the Epiduo as it was aggravating her acne, giving her the same results as the Retin-A. She continued with the Bactrim and stopped the Epiduo and added in Azelia Acid.\n\nSo her routine now is:\n\nAM - Rinse with water - Moisturize with Sebamed - Sunscreen, Biore UV Watery Essence - Take Bactrim\n\nPM - Wash with Vanicream somedays or with a benzoyl peroxide wash other days - Azelaic Acid - Moisturize with Sebamed - Take Bactrim.\n\nShe has just started her second month on Bactrim and we have seen a lot of her active acne clear up. She still has a lot of PIE so it looks like her acne is worse than it really is. Her Doctor wants to put her on Accutane. I am nervous to do this as I hate to see her have a really bad purge with going off the antibiotic along with the initial purge that often comes with Accutane. I am also concerned about the possible negative side effects from Accutane. The doctor said that if we dont want to do the Accutane, she can stay on the antibiotics for 6 months but when she goes off the antibiotics, it is likely her acne will come back. Her doctor seems to be in favor of the accutane and says that she can stay on the Bactrim for the first two months she's on Accutane.\n\nI don't know what to do. I am a bit nervous about putting my daughter on Accutane. Maybe she should just stick with the antibiotics for 6 months as opposed to going on accutane. Has anyone gone off antibiotics and stayed clear? What are your thoughts on Accutane? It is just so hard on my daughter to go from persistent teenage acne to severe acne that has scarred her face all within 3 months.

So shes going to put me on Bactrum instead. I completed the paperwork for ipledge today during my appointment and I also took another pregnancy test. I know itll come back negative because I havent had sex since I started accutane ( which was in January). I think its weird that I would have to wait a whole month to restart accutane, especially if my pregnancy test is negative. I just started seeing slight progress and I dont want to mess that up. Is there any way I can bypass having to wait a month?  Can I talk to someone at iPledge? Has anyone had to wait a month, then restart? If so, how was your acne during that month?'"

I am 25F, I was prescribed Spirinolactone 25mg 3 months ago for acne. My derm didnt give me any warnings about it besides it makes you pee a lot, which was true for me. Last week my dosage was upped to 75 mg because I wasnt seeing results. I also noticed since I began taking this my period has been out of whack. Longer than usual, starting sooner each month, and this month and yesterday in particular my period was very light and almost non existent which is strange for me. I didnt think too much of it, but last night I woke up late to go pee at around 2am, and as I went there was the Niagara Falls of blood I usually expect during my cycle. I went back to my night stand to take some advil and next thing I know Im so dizzy I cant see, and I fainted straight backwards. I came too with my fianc shaking me awake and my whole body tingly, I felt empty inside and like I was drunk or drugged and tripping out. I then had to run to the bathroom and was having terrible period cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting all at the same time. I started panicing and was crying in pain so after I tried to calm down in a cold shower we went to the ER. The cause of all of this mess was the Spirinolactone causing me to have to extreme low blood pressure and low sodium levels and extreme dehydration that has been happening for 3 months. I will never be taking this medicine again even if it means I have to deal with acne. All this to say do your research and ask your derm questions because I didnt. If a medicine is made for people with high blood pressure it probably shouldnt be handed out to people suffering with acne like candy the way it is!!!'"

cymbalta,https://www.reddit.com/r/benzodiazepines/comments/10bbamq/arrythmia_after_taking_ambien_and_klonopin_long/,b'Arrythmia after taking Ambien and Klonopin long term',,"b'Hello everyone, I wanted to share my experience taking two addictive meds BOTH Ambien (10mg) and Klonopin (0.5mg). I was also taking Effexor and Seroquel. I had been taking Ambien for a couple years and it pretty much stopped working as it did in the beginning. I ended up going through a phase of anxiety and my doctor prescribed some Klonopin, without giving me clear guidance to only take as needed or for a short period of time. I was already taking one addictive medication, the Ambien, and now I began taking two. \n\nAll was well for about 8 months after I began the Klonopin daily, sleep was better and my anxiety lessened. However, one evening, as I was lying down watching TV my heart started going off, it felt like there was someone inside my chest beating drums to a steady but irregular beat. I was terrified. I wanted to go to the ER but my GF suggested to hold off on it. I couldn\'t even sleep that night. That was the beginning of about 3-4 years of irregular heartbeat madness. From that day on, every time I would lie down horizontally or bend down to pick something up my heart would start going off, it was terrifying. I had to sleep on an angle with 4-5 pillows underneath me. Every time I would roll off the pillows my heart would wake me up in the middle of the night.\n\nI made an appointment to see a cardiologist and he told me based on the EKG that I was experiencing PVC\'s and PAC\'s (premature contractions of the heart). He said they were no big deal and that they were not dangerous, most people don\'t even notice them. He prescribed some beta-blockers but that actually made my heart worse since it slowed down my heart rate. I ended up having a catheter ablation surgery a few months later where they attempted to zap my heart with a catheter inserted through the groin and into the heart. Unfortunately, that did not fix the problem. The only thing that helped my heart was exercise. After running for 30 minutes I was able to lay down for 5-6 hours without irregular beats. I ended up exercising every night before bed.\n\nI realized the problem must a side effect of one of the medications I was taking. So, along with my doctor, we began testing which one it could be. The first suspect was Seroquel so I switched it to Zyprexa. Waited, but my heart was still acting up. Then Effexor, switched to Cymbalta, then to Zoloft, but that didn\'t work. I was at the end of my rope. We tried lowering Ambien but my heart got significantly worst, to the point when I would feel the irregular beats even standing up and my anxiety skyrocketed. I started loosing patience and faith. Luckily, I stumbled across an article online stating how some alcoholics can have arrhythmia (irregular beats). I immediately connected the dots and realized I was taking TWO addictive GABA drugs which was awfully similar to an alcoholic, only I wasn\'t drunk.\n\nSo my last idea was to get off of the Klonopin - no matter what, I had been on 0.5-1mg for about two years now when I decided to wean off to see if it would help my heart. Similarly, as with the Ambien reduction my anxiety increased really fast and my irregular heartbeats got significantly worse. After a couple months and getting down to 0.25mg my heart was way worse and I said F\\* it.. so I just stopped taking the Klonopin. I couldn\'t fall asleep at night for a couple months unless I drank a beer to settle my heart and my nerves. However, I had my gf and my family as support and I took it ""one day at a time"". After about 4 months of being off of the Klonopin I noticed the irregular hearbeats were not as strong, I was able to fall asleep lying down for the first time in years. I was very relieved. \n\nThe cocktail of two benzo-like drugs really messed up my hearts rhythm in just 8 months. I went crazy trying to figure out why, doctors had no clue, I couldn\'t hold down a good job because I was too preoccupied with my heart. I am writing this to let others know that these benzos can cause some really random issues and doctors might have no idea what it is or how to fix it.'"

I'm just nervous because of my age, maybe they didn't think I could have cancer so they just didn't take a ton of time to make sure? It felt rushed. Then I also don't 100% trust the hospital I went to because they ended up missing an issue with my heart on a echocardiogram. The issue I have needs to be monitored yearly. I didnt know they missed that until after this ultrasound was scheduled.

My adventures to get treatment have been.. eye-opening. I'd like to have some input from any lurking physicians in here, if any.\n\nI'm 24, I've been symptomatic for almost 10 years now, my condition greatly worsening around 4 years ago. I have been on 'temporary disability' for 5 years, I am unable to work or study, I haven't even finished high school. Basically, after sleeping for couple of days (20-40 hours with some hours spent up in between) I have few days when I can keep up my concentration and my physical condition before terribad fatigue and tiredness sets in - basically a mixture of chronic fatigue syndrome and idiopathic hypersomnia. Needless to say, I don't really have much social contact IRL\n\nDespite this, I've had 4 doctors tell me they couldn't do anything for me; they would not prescribe any stimulants or other meds that could help. At some point I was able to get a prescription for modafinil, which helps me immensely, but I still have trouble with concentration and hypersomnolence. I can study (stuff like physiology) by myself for 2-6 hours, on good days, but that's it. I like to jog when I can but that's usually limited to maximum of 2 times /week because my performance goes so low, similar to athletes with overtraining syndrome. Actually, even then it seems to sloooowly build up and force me to rest (i.e no physical exercise)\n\nI had a polysomnograph done with no evidence of sleep apnea or other disorders. Total sleep time was 550 minutes: S1 17%, S2 46%, S3 10%, S4 13% SREM 15%. AHI 2.2/hour, PLM index 12/hour. Now, the SREM was very low, which I expected, and the physician scoring it explains this with my venlafaxine (300mg/d) I am on, and I agree with her. Other physician (neurologist) thinks it's very abnormal and definitely not explained fully by the medication. I can't find any support for this in Pubmed/Google papers. Anyway, he wanted to keep observing my situation, despite the fact that I have been on 400-600mg of modafinil for 2 years and still unable to work or go to school. I pushed him to GTFO and he caved in and prescribed me 36mg of Concerta per day.\n\nSad thing is.. I don't notice really anything. Slight headache and tremor at times, that's it. Today I took my usual 400mg modafinil with 36mg Concerta, 3 hours later I crushed a 18mg pill to test if that has any effect, but I still had to take a 3-hour nap in middle of the day (7 hours after modafinil dose). I do feel a tiny bit more alert but really, this is it? This shit was so hard to get and it does nothing? \n\nI'd like to test dextroamphetamine but I strongly think the current doc won't prescribe it, seeing how reluctant he was with Concerta. I don't understand how doctors can abandon patients like me, even though there exists drugs that can work. They have nothing to lose but I've already lost almost everything. I don't drink alcohol or smoke at all and my relatives don't have any history of drug abuse. I'm motivated to go to school and help others. Yet, it's as if I have to fight for every treatment to get it. \n\nI don't seriously understand this. Physicians of reddit, please share your thoughts."""

Tetracycline eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/aocrw4/my_accutane_experience_13_months_post_accutane/,b'My Accutane Experience - 13 Months Post Accutane',,"b""(if this is against community rules please feel free to take it down - I just thought this could be helpful!) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was on Accutane from June 2017 - December 2017, and thought I would share my experience here, and hopefully answer any questions about what it's like before, during, and after. I've broken it up into little categories in case you're only looking for specific information. \n\nMY SKIN HISTORY: \n\nI've had acne since I was about 11 - it was never really that bad, just something that ran in my family, and didn't really think much about. Right before I started high school, it started to get more severe, and I started going to my derm. I was on a couple of different topical prescriptions throughout most of high school, including Differin, Epiduo,  Clindamycin, Dapsone, as well as taking Doxycycline for a while. I still got acne, but it wasn't as bad as it could be, and I just tried to ignore it. \n\nAt the end of my senior year of high school, my acne started to get really bad in a way it hadn't before - I had cystic acne all over my face and even on my jaw, which had never happened before. My derm put me on Tetracycline, but it gave me these weird nose-bleeds that I could feel in my brain, so I just stopped taking it. So I asked her about Accutane, and after the normal pre-accutane shit (blood tests, peeing in a cup, more blood tests, etc) I started taking it. \n\nI think I was on 30mg the first month, then 60mg for a while, and then finally somewhere around 80mg, but I don't really remember. \n\nSIDE EFFECTS: \n\n**I'm going to preface this with: if you feel like accutane is affecting your mental and physical health in any way that does not seem normal, please talk to your doctor and try to figure something else out. I was an idiot who chose vanity over my own health, and I'm still dealing with the consequences.** \n\n\\[PHYSICAL\\] I've always had horrendously dry skin, so accutane didn't actually dry my skin out much more than it already was. My lips got ridiculously dry and cracked, I experienced that weird nose-bleed-but-not things where you just have bloody scabs in your nose the whole time -  I only got an actual nose-bleed once, near the end. My ability to heal took a nose-dive (seriously, I cut the back of my heel on a door about three months in, and it still hasn't completely healed. It's just this weird, slightly raised, purple scar now.)  I was basically in constant, low level bodily pain and always fatigued. I had dry eye, and my vision would constantly blur in bright light and/or darkness to the point where I was effectively momentarily blind in certain environments, and I still can't see as well as I used to when I am facing direct sunlight. I was also short of breath after short walks that would never had made me winded before. I experienced mild hair thinning, as well as my hair being dryer than normal, but that fixed itself after I finished. I completely lost my appetite, and lost probably about 10 or 15 pounds, which I normally wouldn't have considered a negative, but I looked more like a slowly decaying corpse, rather than like I'd started going to the gym more often. \n\n\\[MENTAL\\] I've struggled with depression on and off since I was about fourteen, but figured accutane wouldn't really make that much of a difference. It did. I became more severely depressed than I have ever been, basically living in a fog. I honestly can't remember much of my time on accutane because I was just completely checked out. It upped my suicidal ideation up by about 1000 notches, and I still struggle with suicidal thoughts. I also developed anxiety, which I had never had an issue with before, and it has not gone away. I was also just a major, wildly moody bitch all the time, because of all of the above. \n\nHOW I COPED:\n\nWater is your best friend. Water should always be your friend, but while on accutane, you should be married to it. Get a liter water bottle and drink from it constantly. I think by the end of Accutane I was drinking about 4 liters of water throughout the day. \n\nDevelop a skin-care routine that isn't harsh, but takes care of your skin. Moisturize moisturize moisturize - day and night, and make sure your day-time moisturizer has an SPF. Cetaphil (ironically) breaks me out, so I use Eucerin face wash and moisturizers, an astringent, and tea tree oil to take care of the acne that does occasionally form now.   (Tea tree oil is pretty drying, though, and while I was on accutane I would only use it every couple of days.) \n\nLip balm and aquaphor. Religiously. \n\nSleep regularly and often. The fatigue is terrible, if you get it, and hits at the most random times - don't skimp on sleep, it helps. \n\nEat. As much as you can. Your body is going through hell, and even if you haven't felt hunger in 3 months, you still need to put food in your body so it can keep you going. \n\nIf you usually wear makeup - don't. I know it sucks walking around with a bare face when you have acne, but I think that really helped the accutane do it's job faster, since I wasn't clogging my pores with chemicals. Plus, when your skin gets that dry, it's hard to make anything look good. \n\nRESULTS:\n\nI don't have pictures to post since I never photographed myself when I had bad acne, and I don't even photograph myself all that much these days, but my skin is clear and smooth. (Not-so) amusingly, the literal day after I stopped taking accutane, I woke up with two angry looking white-heads, one on each side of my face, right next to my nose. I Freaked Out, but they went away in about two days. \n\nI had no active acne by the end of the third month, and I was lucky enough that I a) didn't have pitted acne scars, and b) the remaining months took care of most of the scarring and hyper-pigmentation that I did have. \n\nI only break out now if I'm doing something that would have broken me out before accutane - wearing makeup that irritates me, eating too much dairy (I'm actually semi-convinced that accutane made dairy break me out more than it did before, but I have no actual proof of that), or other random things, like nicotine withdrawal. The breakouts that I do get can barely be classified as such, in comparison to what my skin was like pre-accutane. They rarely come to a head, go away after a few days, and don't leave dark red marks that take months to fade. \n\nWOULD I DO IT AGAIN:\n\nNo, never in my life. However, as you can probably tell, I had a really shit run of it, and I probably shouldn't have continued taking it, but my blood tests were always fine, so I figured it probably wasn't going to kill me or anything. It worked, that is for sure. Everybody has different reactions, and as I said above, please talk to your doctor if something doesn't feel right - having severe acne sucks in a lot of ways, but there are other ways to manage it, and your well being is the most important thing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: Accutane sucks, but it's (mostly) worth it.** """

acetaminophen vomit,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/wubsao/i_feel_like_im_the_only_real_person_has_this/,"b'I feel like Im the only real person, has this happened to anybody else.'",,"b'A few things before you read this, it might be a little long, so Ill make a tldr at the bottom. Second, I dont know if this is the right subreddit to ask this in, so sorry in advance. Also, there will be a brief mention of overdosing.\nThis all slowly started happening about 3 months ago. I woke up one day, walked downstairs to get breakfast and saw my mom sitting at the table. She said good morning and tried to start a conversation, but everything felt a little off. I cant really describe it, it was sort of like she was somebody who was isolated for their entire life trying to act like an extremely social person. The feeling lasted for about 20 minutes, every interaction seemed unnatural and awkward. \nAfter the feeling went away, I didnt experience anything like it for a couple days. About half a week later, it came back, only this time it was stronger. For about 5 hours, every time I talked to anybody, it felt like they were robots trying to have a personality. Sometimes I would physically cringe when they said or did things that were just flat out annoying. I would start to feel this more frequently and more intensely until about a month ago. I was feeling really down and took about 2 grams of Zoloft, 10,000mg of acetaminophen, and 800ish mg of diphenhydramine (The chemical found in Benadryl) As a result, it triggered a weird psychotic episode that ended up getting me in an ICU after vomiting for about 11 hours. I dont remember much of the 3-4 days after the overdose besides having extremely vivid hallucinations. Once I was allowed to leave the hospital, the feeling of everybody acting like robots trying to have a personality returned, but this time it wouldnt go away. This is sort of a weird way to describe it, but it seems like everybody has the humor of a millennial. Things I didnt pay much attention to before now seem extremely abnormal. For example, talking to animals (especially if theyre using a weird voice) talking about animals in a weird voice, nicknames/pet names, explanations such as Yeah! Mocking people or saying dialogue from stories in their voice, and pretty much and informal phrases. Its been making me withdrawal socially and all my responses are always short to people in person.  \n\nTLDR; I feel like everybody is trying to fake having a personality. Its taking a huge toll on my social life, I feel like Im the only person who has feelings. \n\nPlease let me know if anything similar to this has happened to you or anybody you know. If you have any information, I would appreciate it if you told me.'"

I should have kept better track of my results but after month 2 I was concentrating on healing than documenting. I tried to remember as much as I can and tried to include as much info as I could.\n\nThe TL;DR of this is that I was able to recover near fully (i'm still working on it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key Points**\n\nFirst off I think here are the most important things in recovering\n\n\\- Definitely have the optimism or drive to continue to discover and improve.\n\n\\- Finding positive posts like [https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/7rbrx0/a\\_much\\_needed\\_fing\\_sciatica\\_success\\_story/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/7rbrx0/a_much_needed_fing_sciatica_success_story/) can help.\n\n\\- I understand the pain can be debilitating, which is why having loved ones that support you is important.\n\n\\- Self experiment and try new things\n\n\\- Time and dont rush.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly speaking, looking at Google, it says most Sciatica resolves itself around 6 months and has greatly improved. So I'm not 100% sure if it was just time, or if it was my due diligence and stretches and exercises. I want to say that the stretches helped a lot and if i just left it alone for 6 months I wont be much better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Timeline**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAug 2018\n\n28th - Started to feel some discomfort, I dont think i did anything out of the ordinary, maybe sometimes I had to lift 50lbs or so weight but I've always lifted carefully. I think the culprit is from sitting too much. I sit in an office for 8 hours then go home and sit front of a computer for another 5-8 hours with bad posture.\n\n29th/30th - The pain worsens\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSept\n\n3rd - Started taking Ibuprofen, didn't really help\n\n4th - Started to go to the gym to stretch (this was my biggest mistake). Not because I went to the gym, but I didn't research the appropriate stretches\n\n10th - Started to use Robaxacet (didnt' really help). Started muscle relaxant and painkillers. I want to say it might have helped a bit with the relaxant and pain killers\n\n11th - From the meds I started to feel better, maybe 20-30% less pain, but once again I do not recommend this unless you really can't sleep since it is just covering up the symptoms.\n\n14th- I noticed my posture is off and my back is straight (it should have a natural arch) but it is straight.\n\n15th - Tried some THC and rested. I dont think this really helped either.\n\n17th Started to do tennis ball roll on the back, it was really painful, didn't help too much either.\n\n18th feels like i can bend and move more, sitting presses against my nerves, but i can do back lifts/extension  without issues. This is also the day where I started feeling less back pain and more in the legs. The pain is moving down to my foot.\n\n19th- Went to Athletic therapy and realizes pain worsens. This whole time the stretches I've been doing involved a lot of flexion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wqd093kj7jm21.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=af6234fbed2508666cad6fcad197bef61e0f5fae\n\nI always heard if you can touch your toes, you have a healthy back. So I continued to push myself no matter how painful it was to do the flexion exercises. However this is what damaged my back more. I gritted through the pain believing no pain no gain.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT DO THIS. This amount of pain brought tears to my eyes. Later in Nov/Dec I had my MRI and CT scan I realize in addition to sciatica, this was a herniated disc with a huge mass pushing against my spinal nerves.  So pretty much my flexion stretches pushed out that disc gel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n21st - I went to the doctors and Naproxen, but I dont believe this was strong enough to ease the pain.\n\nAt this point in time I can't walk, sit or sleep without extreme pain.\n\n21/25th- Started to try Chiropractors. I never trusted chiros and didn't believe in their work. After this entire event, I am still sticking to that. None of the cracking, or manipulation aided in the recovery. They did give me a back support belt which wasn't helpful during that time. I've used the back support belt in January- March 2019 on and off. So...there's that\n\n26th- Massage therapy, at this point the RMT wasn't too helpful, however advice of soaking in warm/hot water with epson salt (i didnt use salt though) for 15-30 minutes was a bit helpful. Im not sure how helpful, but it allowed me to relax and promote blood flow on the back. Hoping this would heal it faster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOct\n\n26th/Oct 3- tried acupuncture. I am afraid of needles and this was a painful procedure too. I can't say much about this experience. I dont think acupuncture can cure sciatica, however I do truly believe the pain it causes during the meeting releases natural pain killers ( adenosine ) this enables you focus and on resting and recovering the back. Imagine you hurt your arm and someone comes and slaps you in the face, you forget about your arm and focus on the face. This is of course temporary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring this whole time I've been going to Physio too. Keep in mind finding the right physio is crucial. I've been to a few that denied it was sciatica or gave me flexion stretches.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point I have taken (please don't mix meds! Consult your doctor if you are uncertain)\n\nNaproxen\n\nGabapentin\n\nAmittriptyline\n\nCyclobenzaprine\n\nI hate pain killers, I normally dont even take tylenol or advil. However because of the pain I was in. I had to take some for the nerve pain and some for sleep. Essentially all these meds, chiro, acupuncture, massage, physio was to get me comfortable enough to rest and sleep.\n\nI wanted to reiterate, I can barely walk, I would limp and it wouldn't be far. I can't sit at all. I would need to lie on the floor to eat, and watch tv. I can't sleep at night unless i take drugs. I've tried pillow between legs etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n12th This is when I found a physio that knew the Mackenzie method of back recovery. I did a lot of research on the Mackenzie method and thanks to  [u/ItchesForRiches](https://www.reddit.com/user/ItchesForRiches) post I was able to find a Physio that did Mackenzie. I tried to do these stretches a bit on my own but thought they were useless. Until I went to the physio and he very very methodically went through a few items and slowly introduced exercises. I'm not patient and this guy was super slow. However his exercises worked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Oct- Dec**Following exercises and customize exercise. Went to take MRI and CT scans, waited to see if I need surgery. Had the meeting in March, spoilers, I do not need surgery. Maybe back in Oct/Nov I might have been recommended surgery, but even then they can't push that gel back in, they need to cut it out, remove it, possibly even fusing my spine which would limit my back movement. So if you can, try to avoid surgery since it's not even a guarantee heal.\n\nDuring this time I essentially just continued to do the stretches like clockwork, over and over again. 3 times a day, for 3 months. Each week or two I'd notice less pain and slight improvements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the exercises\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 1 Flexion\n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bntvhnsk7jm21.png?width=240&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=229d7dba30586edadeccde3e401fb1248c121096\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxhhr7jl7jm21.png?width=240&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=21eba8d818f6072f090264a75f2d0c546d6bf426\n\n**Instructions**\n\nStand up straight with your feet together, about one foot away from a wall.Place your outermost hand on the side of your pelvis so as to apply pressure on the top of the pelvic bone.Use your hand to push your pelvis towards the wall so as to cause your back to stretch towards one side.Relax your back.PROGRESSION: Repeat with your feet further away from the wall.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** every 3 hrs | **Hold:** 5 secs | **Tempo:** glide hips to left only\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 2 Active ROM rotation\n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ys2j54hm7jm21.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f11f0a9db64b5ee27d6fcf74cded309d6a466fdd\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jkfrerfn7jm21.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9d93a5aa12b63bd5f1161bb6067f17e2e2c5a417\n\n**Instructions**\n\nLie on your back and with your knees bent and foot on the floor (crook lying).Place arms out to side for stability.Slowly lower legs to one side until you feel a gentle stretch and then to the other side.Return to neutral position and repeat.Keep your knees together during the movement.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** 3 x a day | **Hold:** 15 secs\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 3 Single knee to chest\n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7rt4ijbo7jm21.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=00e4e80f2e202b4206c965a388b20902652b9baf\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/de2m8gap7jm21.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6e005c7f71d79fa5ea7dc7497f086d6645dbc621\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Instructions**\n\nLie on your back with both knees bent, hands behind one knee.Pull the knee towards your chest slowly, release and then repeat until pain relief or as prescribed by your therapist.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** 3 x a day | **Hold:** 15 secs\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 4 Thoracic stretch\n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/73sxlk5q7jm21.png?width=240&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=09af89f032842e7da84846d814a4507830bed1de\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y2zi5uvq7jm21.png?width=240&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=04f85c381905ffbfcd0a964a179eda591b95d89d\n\n**Instructions**\n\nLie on your side with knees bent at 90.You can place a towel under the head for support.Place the bottom hand on the knees and press lightly to make sure they stay on the ground.With the top hand, reach for your ribs and pull gently as you rotate the torso.Hold the position for the required time and repeat following guidelines.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** 3 x a day | **Duration:** lay on right side only | **Hold:** 15\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 5 Passive ROM Extension\n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45wkr5ur7jm21.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f06c6095c95681c90dc726b490f007e5050be40e\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3acvoxks7jm21.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=46f994a1c9e9d13f7b8db3d62b99f6f5c71decdb\n\n**Instructions**\n\nLie on your stomach with your chin tucked-in.Place hands at approximately shoulder height and bring leg out in to a figure 4 pattern.While keeping the hips and legs on the table, press trunk upward with armswhile relaxing abdominals and buttocks.Slowly return to neutral position and repeat.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** 3 x a day | **Duration:** right leg to side | **Hold:** 2 secs\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 6 Leg glide in supported 45 \n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvhcpq0d8jm21.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f7d799560ac46b851194c763e2be668d07881d27\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u37d2wyt7jm21.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0fdee24ad26b00e8f5ea35e3057a2ce2fcfd1b0e\n\n**Instructions**\n\nLie on your back with the affected leg straight and supported in an elevated positionat a 30 to 45  angle.Pull the toes up toward you, to flex the foot on the elevated leg. Then point the toes down.Alternate between these two positions. Tension should be felt when you flex and it should disappear when you extend the foot.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** 3 x a day\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 7 Sciatic nerve glide\n\n**Step 1Step 2**\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/utvphhou7jm21.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a1f86a6f98d4313a3463d42f8f8684df9ce3c1f\n\n* &#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/br6cwnhv7jm21.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a1f3fed0c0a8e1ac25bde32f9b9ff269d12589f2\n\n**Instructions**\n\nLie on your back and lift the involved leg to 90 degrees, keeping the knee bent. This will be the starting position.Keeping the foot relaxed, extend the knee without moving the thigh.When the knee is extended at its most, actively pull the toes toward your shin. When you reach the point where you feel a pulling sensation along your leg, let go and return to the starting position and repeat.**Repetition:** 10 | **Frequency:** 3 x a day\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had pain in the lower right side, So i had a preference side. These exercise help focus on the injured side. The goal is to centralize the pain and push it from the legs back up to the lower back.\n\nWith these exercises I focused on doing this 2 to 3 times a day. 10 reps for each exercise, holding for 15 seconds each.I did this for about 2 months straight and I've been introducing my own stretches (this is where you need to experiment and find what helps).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MODIFICATIONS**\n\nFor example here were my changes (be careful since everyone is different). Do these at your own risk\n\n**1 Flexion**\n\nIn the flexion exercise, I had my pain on the right side, so I would push my hip to the left. I modified this exercise, and instead of using the wall after I got used to it, I went more extreme and stood straight up and bent without the wall hoping to bend further.\n\nWhat the flexion exercise does (at least my understanding of it) is that it sets your back straight in order for you to proceed with the other stretches.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2 Active ROM Rotation**\n\nI did this unchanged throughout the whole time until in March 2019 where i did this on the end of a couch or bed so my legs can drop further and i used my arms to pull it further down and thats when you really hear your back crack. I dont recommend this until you are almost healed since I dont know what effects it will have before then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3 Single knee to chest**\n\nI did these with double knee to chest once I felt comfortable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4 thoracic stretch**\n\nNo changes\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5 Passive Rom Extension.**\n\n**There are many variations of this i did.**\n\nA) First i followed the instructions. I believe the knee bend is to focus on the right side of your back.\n\nB1) Some modifications I did was not to bend any legs. Once you are comfortable with both of those you can try some of the other modification\n\nB2) another stretch I tried was just lying face down and fully relaxing and see if your back hurts. Try this again but with knees bent about 90 degrees, then try to tilt it to the left or right.  I use this as a test to see if there's any improvements after these modified stretches.\n\nC) I had my wife sit on my back and push down near the pelvic area, since I noticed my body lifting when I'm doing these extensions. With her keeping my pelvic on the floor i was able to stretch the back more. **This would be probably one of the more useful exercises with my wife sitting down**. It gave me more movement and less pain. I kept pushing this exercise. I felt pain, but its not like a bad pain, more like a sore pain, (hard to explain), but I was able to push more and further each time. It was hard but helpful.\n\nD1) This modification is where i had my chest and neck **on the floor** and my lower body on the ball and I've asked my wife to lift my legs and bend it towards my head, this was uncomfortable, difficult and painful. below is the closest picture I can find, i apologize for the unclear picture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mxinxkiw7jm21.png?width=183&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f861574a8c49754b1c8503f2337305e641fa5585\n\nD2) At the same time as C's I used an exercise ball (really large one, larger than the picture below) and I did the following. I lay on my back and the ball was large enough that my legs barely touching the floor. I would roll the ball back and use my arms to balance my body and let my lower body/legs dangle, fully relaxed. I would lift both legs up balancing with my arms then drop both my legs down fully relaxed to really stretch it out.

I tried the camel pose, please see below. It was too difficult for me to do. So I did this at my bed room doorway but I had a broom stick placed across the door frame and place it around my pelvic area height-wise. Then i leaned back and stretched. **This modification was another exercise that allowed me to see great improvements.** . Be careful as the broom might snap, and it did damage my door frame by rubbing some paint off. I was able to achieve great flexibility with this exercise and it helped with a lot of the pain. I would say the base exercise gets you ready and modification C and E was the most impactful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzp1m41y7jm21.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8413c97ee5a87fce687afc940977fb5320db897a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nF) After I did the broom stick stretch (above), I started to do the camel pose properly, I still can't do it, but I'm working on it. The key is to try to relax your back and let it drop.\n\nG) The final modification was similar to Step D1\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/adav58xg8jm21.png?width=183&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=30d3eb94e5022d0dff0e6a1b9b9ebfed82d5eceb\n\nWhere instead of a ball i rested my legs on a couch and would try to let my body reach the ground. The key is let your back fully relax and drop. this is hard to explain, but try to be as limp as possible. I tried placing my upper body on the floor and letting it droop and relax and breathe in and out to make sure it gets a full natural stretch.\n\nI found that the stretches in the earlier stages used more muscles to force you into that position, but i still felt there could be improvements from the pain. I am still doing this exercise till this data (march 2019). I let everything relax and let my legs rest on the couch and i feel the tightness, and soreness on the back. This allowed me to slowly stop using the back support belt when sitting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**step 6 and 7 in the physio guide**\n\nI didn't really do them since i was in too much pain, and when i started to mod my stretches, i was able to move more, and flexibility and strength came back and didn't require to do these at all. But if you find them helpful, please continue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Jan- Feb**\n\nRest with minimal stretches . At this point there is some discomfort and would hurt if i sat too long or took too big of a step, too sudden of a movement. But during this period I would say i have had major improvements after the 3 months of constant stretching and testing. My right leg muscles have atrophied but I slowly started walking and doing more which built it back up.\n\nAlso during this time, Not sure if I got lazy or if i found resting at this point made some improvements. I tend to have rested a lot and stretched twice a week, down from 3 times a day.\n\nI also used back support belt when sitting since sitting still gave pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**March**\n\nStarted to feel even better and do not require a back support belt. I did further Customized stretches. Which I explained above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAt this point, there is still a bit discomfort when sitting too long, but thats about it. I'm trying to continue these stretches to make sure my back is nice and flexible. I haven't tried to lift anything too heavy with my back yet. I will naturally ease into this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Take aways from**\n\nChiro - not helpful, the belt was a bit helpful during Jan/Feb.\n\nPhysio- Find the right one that knows what they are talking about, do your own research\n\nAcupuncture - Good way to divert the pain and numb it and allows you to rest and for you to do other things such as stretch and sleep.\n\nMassage Therapist - Not too helpful, but got the idea of soaking in hot/warm water to promote blood flow and recovery\n\nDoctor - gives drugs out, those can help you sleep, but I would recommend try to minimize this. The less drugs you have the more you are able to determine what you need to do to improve instead of just numbing the pain.\n\nSpine assessment clinic - too late for surgery.\n\nStretches - Test, experiment, be careful, know your limit, have someone there helping you if you need.customize on what makes you feel better. But do educated research so you aren't injuring yourself more\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: clarified the meds on the post."""

codeine problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/12sgtnc/intense_existentialism/,b'Intense Existentialism??',,"b'I want to first start off by saying I have no idea where to post about this feeling but, the closest explanation I saw was on another post in this community so I just said, why not? \n\nAlso let me preface.I abuse substances heavily. I dont know if thatll have any correlation but, you be the judge of that -The first drug I tried at about 12 (aside from wine at the dinner table) was xanax, soon after codeine, then weed, liquor, and finally psychedelics all before the age of 16. As of now I abuse liquor the most, at about a 5th of gin a day since 2019 & a heavy weed smoker. I got bad with my DOC (Benzos) and have been off of em for about 2 years now. Im quite familiar with therapy, treatment, and have never been on any formal prescribed medication. However I have been formerly diagnosed with dysthymia (early onset) at age 9. Ive had a couple suey-wooey attempts once upon a time and even more ideations as well which makes what this post about a bit more perplexing to me\n\nFor about the past 5 years Ive been having a heady/intense feeling persist mentally & emotionally where it just seems so fucking unbelievable that Im conscious and connected with not only myself but, other human beings as wellI experience overwhelming senses of gratitude, compassion, condolence, etc - basically it seems as if every emotion I experience is accentuated to the point where they become psychosomatic, which ranges from elevated heartbeat, rapid breathing, pacing, general feelings of restlessness or even full-on vigor.  The initial onset of these feelings happened maybe the 2nd or 3rd time doing psychedelics when I was about 17. Ideas of highlighting the importance of community, deep investigative introspection, and adventuring the spectrum of experience/being flooded my mind.I wrote them off as basic hippie-ass ideas, as I was just a teenage boy finally learning true empathy and what it meant to actually exist for the first time and just assured myself this is normal and Im just maybe becoming a halfway decent human being. As time progressed, these ideas and feelings became progressively more intense and persistent, I could spend hours if not days in this state. With whomever I interact with I feel compelled to talk with them about their entire damn being, with fervency at that!down to how their mind works, family, traumas, living situations, you name it & all the while im deeply intrigued/invested/concerned to the point where it even feels like im creeping myself out (its pretty cringe honestly) Me just realizing I can simply control my body blows me away sometimes to the point where I need to sit down for 5 minutes. Every emotion I feel is just accentuated to the point where it becomes a rollercoaster.I made a joke at myself saying Im like a pregnant lady (but actually made somewhat of sense because I know alcohol decreases testosterone/increases estrogen and causes weight gain which ive been experiencing via beer belly and gynecomastic tits but I refuted back to myself saying this state first started at 17 however, i do recognize the alcohol isnt exactly helping either) - ideas and feelings of intense existentialism is the best way i can describe it (& its becoming quite ironic that i heavily denounce solipsism and often rant about how solipsism is plaguing the western world now)\n\nTo add more context, my boundaries werent always the best and still (obviously) arent. However I want to add I dont have problems saying or taking Nos to/from individuals and/or groups and, respecting boundaries. I express general tact and decorum while speaking to people and have possessed the gift of gab & a healthy amount of charisma from a very young age but this here is just unprecedented.\n\nI understand and want to acknowledge this is one of those good problem scenarios & I know there are individuals with waaaaay worse problems than I. It just feels as if im constantly on sensory/emotional/mental overload & paired with my history of drug use and mental illness I get the inkling there could be more to this\n\nIf you made it to the end of this regardless of the reason why, thanks & if anyone else has experienced this individually or knows more about what Im describing, please interact\n\n\nPS Im pretty familiar with most of the spiritual/metaphysical stuff and didnt want this entire post to be perceived that Im havin some stereotypical Lvl 1 ass spiritual awakening, as Im inquiring on a psychological level'"

On days where it isnt urgent, its still very loose.\n\nMedical History: \n- Diagnosed with diabetes in July 2020 due to bloods showing HBA1C of 102 (mmol/mol)\n- Started on Metformin while in hospital following diagnosis to check for ketoacidosis (negative).\n- High blood pressure & tachichardia found at follow-on appointment - started on atenolol and ramapril.\n- Searching for cause of such a sudden onset of diabetes (no prior medical issues before this), took private ultrasound.

I apparently have quite a small mouth (I have been told this by several dentists in the past), and **1 oz. of fluid is far too much for me to be able to ""vigorously swish"" between my teeth**: my cheeks bulged like a hamster just trying to hold it in.  The problem only got worse over the course of the minute as my mouth produced additional saliva, leading me to spend the final 20 seconds holding my head over the sink in case in case it became too much for my lips to hold in.  When my 1 minute timer was up, I spat out approximately half and then was finally able to ""vigorously swish"" as I should have been doing all along. \n\n\nAfterwards I checked the instructions for the non-prescription mouth rinse that I was using previously (sodium fluoride 0.02%): I have never measured it out, but the bottle advises ""vigorously swishing"" with 10 ml, which is a significantly smaller volume at only about 1/3 of 1 oz. \n\n\nI also gave 1 oz of water to my (presumably normal-sized mouth!) partner to swish as a test, and he confirmed that this was at the absolute upper end of what he could actively swish in his mouth - which surprised me even further, as the bottle\'s instructions apply to children as young as 6, who surely have far smaller mouths than we do. \n\n\nI\'m confused about how to proceed from here.   **Should I cut the amount of water to a comfortable level and swish with a more viscous rinse to achieve the same total dose?  Or should I scale down both the concentrate and the water to maintain the same 1:7 ratio?**\n\n\nDon\'t worry, I will be contacting my dentist for their advice when they re-open on Monday!!  In the meantime I am very curious to know if anyone else has come across this problem and is therefore able to advise on how I should proceed this weekend, especially while my mouth is at its most sensitive immediately following SRP.'"

The first says just to keep taking NSAIDs and start physical rehabilitation as soon as I feel better. \n2. The second suggests quite a pricy treatment including dry needling, hight intensity magnetic and laser therapy, and plasma injections. All these must help with reducing the pain and resorbing the bulge. \n3. The third offered an epidural steroid injection with X-ray control to resolve the inflammation and swelling locally.

I have been fighting this fight for more than two decades. I am so tired.\n\nI am so tired of looking in the mirror literally hundreds of times a day. Investigating every little crevasse and corner, every shade and nuance, every slight bump, every cyst, everything. Under every conceivable types of lighting, in front of every mirror at home, at school, at work, at the cafe, at my family's house. Worrying over every change, every new arrival, every old arrivals too, stuff from three weeks ago that still shows discoloration. I know the topography of my face better than satellite images could ever know the Earth. \n\nI am so tired of the routine, that careful use of cleanser, medicine, product, moisturizer, sun screen, make-up, every morning, every evening, every shower. It must be weighed and applied to perfecting otherwise it will destroy my face more than it is already destroyed. Or so I tell myself. \n\nI am so tired of watching everything I eat, everything I drink, everything I touch, for fear that it might affect my acne. They say there is no solid evidence diet affects acne but I swear, 20 years of dealing with this shit, if I so much as think about cake or candy or pastries or soda or alcohol or cheese or white rice or anything, my face breaks out like some Kool and the Gang anthem. And of course any change for the worse is a cause for temporary episodes of depression. Or permanent ones.\n\nI am so tired of spending every waking hour of every day concerned about my face. About how that little bump will look at what distance, what people will think about me. But mostly what I think about myself. I am scared to look at people before I've done my routine in the morning, even my kids. How the fuck are they to understand it. I try to smile but I can't. \n\nI am so tired of the cover-up. Of agonizing over finding the right of concealer and matte creme and God knows what - always comedogenic, oil free, no perfume, containing none of 1600 different ingredients that could upset that delicate balance of oil and moist and bacteria on my face. Hundreds of dollars each, of course, because why should reducing your crippling acne-induced depression be cheap. \n\nI am so tired of the medicines. I have tried antibiotics - three different kinds of benzoyl peroxide treatments, plus tetracycline. I have tried retinoids, I have tried azelaic acid - two different treatments, you name it. I have tried isotretinoin (that's Accutane to you Americans), two rounds of one year. I have tried ivermectin (no not to treat covid, Jesus Christ). Sure it has reduced my acne from insane levels in my teens but how the fuck can I be turning 40 having exhausted all medical options. That makes me so tired.\n\nI am so tired of the side-effects. The redness, the itching, the dryness, your liver might be permanently fucked.\n\nI am so tired of doctors saying it's not so bad. It's fucking bad. It's a medical problem but yes it's also a psychological problem. I tried extended therapy treatment with a psychologist. It was okay. It didn't really make much of a different. It just made me more tired, so tired.\n\nI am so tired of the summer and that damned sun. Sun exposure can temporarily improve your acne. But long term it makes it massively worse. Fucking great. I haven't left the shade in twenty years. You know how hard that makes any type of popular summer vacation? It's like trying to dodge landmines in a war zone.\n\nI am so tired of withdrawing from everything. The number of social events I have declined because of acne is innumerable. Even when I'm there, if my acne's bad, I try to hide. I don't look at anyone. I spend hours in the bathroom. I sit in the corner looking at my phone to avoid interaction. I'm a grown fucking person!

Sometimes it feels like my stomach/ribs cannot expand enough to take a deep breath. I also can\'t take air in through my nose. I have had an ultrasound of my abdomen and wore a holter monitor for 72 hours, which were both negative. I haven\'t had a chest X-Ray or any other imaging. My doctor has physically examined me, and said that my turbinates and nasal passages are normal, but my throat looks a little red. He did not comment further. \n\nWhat does everyone thinks is going on? Any help would be appreciated.'"

I have had bad headaches and migraines. I thought it was because I had forgotten to take my meds (adhd meds).\n\n\nBut I let my family tell me when I turned 18 that I should go off them because I no longer needed them as an adult and couldn't keep using them as a crutch. Lovely. \n\n\nSo I stopped taking them. The migraines got worse and more frequent. And I get then really bad. Vomiting, nasuea, chills, shakes, body aches, stiffness, sensitive to light and sound, diarrhoea (sometimes), dizziness, and even extreme drowsiness. I have been to a handful of doctors to see what does it. They cannot figure it out. Had scans and tests. My current doc put me on a preventer. Has helped loads, considering I was getting them once to twice a week. Or lasting a week with the worst for 2 days until I caved and go to the hospital where they give me an iv with medication. Once ER doctor even sent me home with codeine. \n\n\nNow the weird part.\n\n\nAs a kid (until like 17 ish) I remember always being able to crack my jaw. Just like you crack your knuckles. I stretch it enough and it pops! Since being off the meds I can't. I got back on them a few months ago (after about 5 years) and I can pop my jaw again and no migraines. Not really any headaches either.\n\n\nI wonder if it's all connected. I can even feel a migraine start and if I can get my jaw to crack within 2 to 5 minutes the pain is gone.\n\n\nThe preventer I used to be on also works for TMJ and helped as well. Gimme your advice and give me your experiences!  Sorry it's so long. You are all a lovely sub and have been so helpful! \n\n\n"""
Advil problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/o3lvhs/tried_everything_still_cant_find_help/,"b""Tried everything, still can't find help""",,"b'Not really sure where to begin. This is my attempt to be brief in hopes of starting a conversation. I started writing a journal about a six weeks ago. I think it\'s been helpful to write, it\'s as if I finally get to share my experiences, even though no one is listening to them. I  started writing it in what was likely a manic state, which made it easier to write. My thoughts were more fluid and easier to express. Although, I\'m medicated now so mania isn\'t as intense, for better or worse I\'m not sure. For the past couple weeks, I\'ve been in some sort of state fluctuating between manic and depressed on a daily, sometimes hourly basis. I was only recently diagnosed bipolar about 3 months ago, at 34 years old. Although, my thought is that I\'ve probably been bipolar since I was about 24, when I began having problems with insomnia. Previous to that I was depressed for most of my life. \n\nThe diagnoses came after I had the most severe manic state of my life, which lasted about two months. I was hiking in the rocky mountains, often naked, often alone, sometimes in the middle of the night. My feet had deep cuts on them, but I didn\'t care, I felt like an animal, and that\'s how I wanted to live. I slept maybe 1-3 hours per night but had more energy than I\'d ever had in my life. I felt higher than any drug could ever make me. I became physically stronger and healthier than I\'d ever been in my life. I ate almost only fresh meat and vegetables, and did strenuous physical activity all day every day. I was also able to drink copious amounts of whiskey and beer, and smoke weed and cigarettes all day without tiring.  I was able to speak clearly and maintain conversations with people, for what felt like the first time in my life. People loved me. Many of the things I experienced in this state could only be described as magic. I was able to fix physical problems with my mind, I was able to attract and play with what most people consider dangerous wild animals (bears, wolves, owls etc,) I was able to read peoples minds, I made more money trading financial markets in those 2 months than I\'ve made in 4 years of trading. This is why I prefer to call the disease Magic-Melancholy now. It sounds nicer than manic-depression or bipolar disorder, and makes me feel less crazy.    \n\n\nI then became severely depressed and suicidal and, after about 6 months tried seeking professional help. \n\nThroughout the past 8 years, I\'ve tried talking to counsellors, psychotherapists, psychiatrists, general practitioners. None have been very helpful. I had one psychologist in 2017 who was great, but she eventually wanted to start a romantic relationship with me, and that revelation ended our relationship. The drugs I\'ve been prescribed throughout the years have been helpful at times, but never consistently. The main problem I have is insomnia. If I sleep well I\'m feeling good. Most recently when I tried looking for professional help, I saw a counsellor who was, despite her best intentions, useless. Reiterating the text book on mental health isn\'t going to help me. I\'ve already read it a thousand times in a thousand different formats. I also found a shrink which took about a month to get an appointment with and he spent 10 mins on the phone with me and diagnosed bipolar, and prescribed some drugs. The drugs he prescribed didn\'t work. I got another appointment two months later and he prescribed different drugs. They didn\'t work very well but helped a little. I asked for valium but he wouldn\'t prescribe it.\n\nNo one I\'m close with has accepted that I have this disease. Everyone thinks the problems I have are experienced by everyone, ""everyone has mood changes,"" or ""just get a normal job."" etc. I have no one I can talk to about this. My family is all physically separated and emotionally distant from each other.  I suppose I\'m really good at pretending I\'m ok, and just withdraw when I can no longer pretend. Traditionally, I\'m the one who takes care of others. \n\nI then decided to move from Canada to Mexico 2 months ago, against doctors advice, and against government Covid rules. It was difficult to do as travel was banned to Mexico at the time, but I found a way. I was desperate for something to change, or I was going to finish myself off.   \n\n\nI felt really good here for the first month, but now I\'m struggling again some days. I\'m able to get whatever drugs I want here so I\'ve been experimenting a little. If I sleep well I have good days. I\'m taking 50mg Seroquel before bed and 400mg Advil because the Seroquel causes me severe back pain. It puts me to sleep however, but I still wake up in the night. So when I wake up, I take another 50mg Seroquel and 400mg Advil, along with 10mg Valium. My doctors in Canada wouldn\'t prescribe valium but it\'s actually been the best drug for me. It puts me back to sleep most days and I wake feeling rested. It\'s the most sleep I\'ve had in many years. At least I\'m able to have some good days, and I never reach extreme mania or depression anymore. In this sense I\'m doing better than I have been for a very long time. It\'s still hard though because I have no one to talk to. The depressions still exist. There\'s so many things I\'d love to discuss.   \n\n\nI\'m going to try to meditate on a daily basis. I\'ve tried this before but haven\'t been able to maintain consistency, thus never able to get the desired effects of meditation. \n\nAnyways, don\'t wanna ramble on too much. If anyone wants to chat, drop a comment. It would mean the world to me to be able to have conversations about this.'"

I\'ve eaten several meals and I\'ve been staying hydrated, but the pain and sense of fullness in my face (particularly my forehead, eyes, and the bridge of my nose) is still here and so bad that I feel like I\'m going to vomit.

If this is abnormal, what is it or what might it be a symptom of? I\'ve already taken an Advil. Is there anything else I can do about it? Can crying trigger migraines?  Is this a sinus problem?

The left bottom was a little complicated and he cut bone, so I got antibiotics and the pain was managed with Advil. I developed dry socket (bad taste, pain didn't get better) and was instructed to rinse with saline. Pain got better, but never went away, but it got to something like 0.1-0.5/10, so I figured that was that and I put off making an appointment. The pain was mostly in my jaw at that point. \n\nFlash forward to last week-- I started having more pain, including pain in my jaw, gum, and my ear. I made an appointment for last Thursday (4/15). Doc gave me an antibiotic rinse.\n\nSaturday 4/17-- pain gets worse. I get codeine and amoxicillin (allergic to PCN). \n\nSunday 4/18-- face swollen like I have the mumps. See the dentist again, he drains an abscess and pulls out a piece of bone. He explains that the bone died while I had dry socket and the fragment of bone caused an infection. Says I should feel better. Novocaine from the draining wore off while I was driving home and it was some of the worst pain of my life.\n\nMonday 4/19-- Switch to hydrocodone for pain because the codeine isn't working. The hydrocodone works no better, but whatever. Also switch to clindamycin every 6 hours. \n\nWednesday 4/21-- Swelling goes way down. Still swollen, but doesn't look like I have the mumps. Little to no change in pain; no change in treatment.\n\nThe pain is the same today, pretty awful. \n\nDoc plans on putting mesh over the dry socket tomorrow, which he says should help with the pain.\n\nRight now, my pain ranges from 5/10 to 9/10, averaging about an 8/10, and I spend a lot of time curled up in bed crying because of the pain. The lymph node under the jaw in particular is EXCRUCIATING. The inside of my mouth looks fairly normal other than swelling. I'm on q4 Advil and hydrocodone and q6 clindamycin and the pain is still incredible. I wasn't on any pain meds aside from occasional ibuprofen for either the extraction or the dry socket, so I'm not just being dramatic-- this is a whole other level. \n\nOther are duloxetine, dexmethylphenidate, synthroid, birth control, and migrelief vitamins  \nMedical history is Hashimoto's thyroiditis/hypothyroidism, migraines, depression, ADHD, autism\n\nAny advice would be fucking wonderful.

The dentist told me it was intense to remove but to rest for a day and I'll be fine. I wasn't given any pain meds or antibiotics. On day 3 the pain got really bad, called the office, the dentist told me its most likely infected and wanted me on antibiotics. I'm allergic to most antibiotics and he said he isn't specialized in antibiotics so he can't help me and seek help from a GP. I don't have a GP... I pushed him and he ended up calling in an antibiotic (Bactrim) since its the last one I took without a major reaction( 3 years ago), but when speaking to the pharmacist she said its never used for a tooth infection. With being so sensitive to antibiotics I didn't wanna just mess around with one that might not work. Additionally, the dentist hasn't done a visual exam of the site. The pain seems to go away with the help of extra-strength Tylenol, but I still wake up with awful pressure pain in my face. Can't eat solids. I haven't done anything but rest and walking makes me feel that my face will explode. My question being, is this normal for a complicated extracted, could my extraction site be infected or is it the beginning of a dry socket? I will be calling the office first thing in the morning and if they won't help I'll go to Urgent Care, but I would appreciate any guidance or tips to help the pain.\n\nIf it helps with antibiotics, I'm allergic too: Amoxicillin, Cipro, Clindamcyin/Lincomycin class and Metronidazole.\n\n[Best picture i could get](https://preview.redd.it/rxb5rj16qai41.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=34840b74150874cfe90db351dea3055969cb58fa)"""

It began around my bellybutton and has traveled down to my shins. It is most intense around my thighs and buttocks.\n\nThere is severe itching with this that has kept me from having a full night sleep since it appeared. The itching is not persistent, but rather comes on suddenly twice a day and fades away after a couple of hours. There is no rhyme or reason for when or why it starts itching. I can be asleep at home, at work, or just in the middle of my day. \n\nI've had two skin biopsies by my PCP and one by a dermatologist. All three showed no signs of fungal or bacterial infections nor scabies. The biopsy by my dermatologist was more detailed and pointed towards a drug eruption. I have since stopped all prescriptions and supplements for over a month with no success. My dermatologist has told me it can take months for a drug eruption to clear. \n\nIt does calm down when in a bath or if I'm taking high dose corticosteroids. Additionally, Rinvoq has helped but since the biopsy pointed towards a drug eruption my dermatologist feels it's inappropriate to have me on an immunosuppressant. \n\nMoisturizing makes it temporarily better, but then it will come back worse than before. \n\nAs of right now I'm out of options for how to proceed on resolving this. The time I've been off my prescriptions has not done great things for my mental health, so anything to point me in the right direction would be appreciated."""
codeine constipation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/xchczt/brutally_honest_assessment_after_surgery/,b'Brutally Honest Assessment After Surgery',,"b'Hi everyone!  38m here - back in June/July, I obsessively poured over anything I could find regarding before/during/after expectations after a microdiscectomy.  I had a L4-L5 right 18mm extrusion impinging my canal anywhere between 50-75%.  I have DDD, stenosis, and lumbar lordosis in multiple areas and annular tears in a few discs.  Before I go on, a little history:\n\n* I had a L5 - S1 herniation in 2016 that resulted in drop foot that lasted a few months, but then went away \\[I had no idea I had herniated back then\\].  \n* In 2018, randomly started having extreme pain after standing for 20 seconds \\[could not stand\\].  MRI confirmed L4 and L5 herniation.  Doc said I would need surgery but wanted to try ESI.  8 days post ESI all symptoms went away \\[and followed up with 2 more ESIs a few weeks later\\].  Did PT for a few weeks and felt great. Pretty much no issues for 4 years.\n* April/May 2022 felt a twinge in that area that got progressively worse.  Flare ups were nothing new to me and they always resolved in a few days/weeks the past 4 years.  This did not and only got worse with significant nerve pain.  MRI confirmed the 18mm listed above, and re-confirmed the DDD, stenosis, and lordosis.\n\nI see lots of folks either for or against surgery.  We all have our reasons.  My nerve pain and buttock pain was worse in the AM upon waking and awful at night going to bed.  During the day I could have times where there was 0 pain.   I opted for surgery because I hated thinking about the pain 24/7, affecting my time with my wife and kids.\n\nThat said, for the folks that got MDs, in many instances some of the nuances are glossed over.  I hope my notes below help you out.\n\n**For anyone considering getting a microdiscectomy, this is specifically for you:**\n\n* I woke up from surgery with the buttock and nerve pain in my right leg immediately gone\n* My anethesiologist botched my trach tube and pinched my uvula and tore my throat up.  This was worse then my actual back incision.  It took 2 weeks for my uvula to go back to normal.  Up til then it was like I was swallowing it every time \n* The back incision was tender, sore and stiff, but I would not have categorized it as painful.  It was better than the nerve pain.\n* Surgery was around 1pm on July 27th.  I went home a few hours later.  Immediately slept the rest of the day.\n* Back was extremely stiff, had to be mindful of log rolling and getting in and out of bed.  Could not sleep on my back for the first week, had to sleep on my side due to the tenderness of the incision.\n* The constipation from the pain meds is real. Do not slack on your stool softeners.  My first BM was 3 days post surgery and I honestly feel passing that first BM was worse pain then the surgery.  I only took Tylenol and Codeine and muscle relaxers for 3 days after the surgery.  After that, just Tylenol as needed.\n* Sleeping those first few days, I would wake up every 4 hours to use the bathroom.  Lots of liquids throughout the day.\n* My surgeon ordered me at home PT and Nurse - I am grateful as the nurse changed my bandage, and the PT kept me mobile.\n   * Although - I could walk up the stairs in shuffles the first day.  By Day 5 I could body weight squats to pick things up.\n* Sitting was difficult until week 4 where it finally started to feel better.  At week 7 I can sit 95% normally\n* I drank a ton of protein shakes and BCAA/amino acid drinks for recovery, along with my multivitamin.  I really think this helped shorten my recovery time.  After 2 weeks, my surgeon cleared me for PT and I made significant process daily since then.\n* The hardest part of recovery for me has been the mental part of trying a movement or being afraid of re-herniation.  My PT has worked with me a lot to help me regain my confidence in my movements.\n* I was able to walk 2+ miles by Day 5\n\nI am just shy of 7 weeks post-op and I feel amazing.  Every once in awhile if I sit too long my back will spasm (usually when I try getting out a car), or I will have a phantom pain in my buttock \\[remember, I still have stenosis and some impingement in my foramen, but I still have 0 pain levels at the moment\\].  These are nothing compared to the pain I had experienced before the surgery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor anyone on the fence, I hope you find my experience helpful.   It is a lot of work, but I would do it all over again for the results so far.'"

In this time I have learned a lot about him, his ADHD, and how to be more understanding of why and how he does what he does.\n\nMy boyfriend is definitely special. He got an infection that destroyed one of his heart valves at age 19. Ever since then he has had a mechanical heart valve (St. Judes Mechanical Heart Valve). Therefore, he has to take a blood thinner (Warfarin) everyday and have his blood checked every 1-2 weeks. Since he takes blood thinners he has to be careful about the things he eats and takes based on how it may differ how his body metabolizes the blood thinners. He cannot take any kind of medication for his ADHD because of this. \n\nHe used to take medication for it in high school and he didnt like how it made him feel. He said he was calm and could definitely focus more, but he overall felt like a zombie. I think it is kind of cool he does all that he does without medication. He has managed himself very well for the most part but there are some aspects of ADHD that are very obvious and can be difficult sometimes. \n\nRemembering things is a major one. He can be super forgetful even if it is something really important. Remembering to go and have his blood checked is something he typically remembers, but I try to be good girlfriend and remind him the morning and about 2 hours before on the day he needs to have it done.\n \nPaying attention can sometimes be very evident. Mainly towards me when we are together. He gives me attention and affection but there are sometimes when he will come over to hang out and become completely absorbed into his phone or tablet. This can bother me and I try to remind myself he is hyperfocusing. It's just hard when I am sitting next to him and want to talk about life or anything and cuddle while he looks at his phone and it's like he forgets that I exist. \n\nI feel like I do a fairly good job of helping him out and being understand of who he is. Things can be rough sometimes. I get frustrated and annoyed and I know he usually picks up on it because he will try to make jokes and get cuddly/lovey until I cuddle/love him back. Then I tell him whats bothering me when he gives me his full attention so I know he is listening. I know he loves me because of not only what he says and does but because of what his friends tell me too. I love him too and I wont give up on him/us as long as he never gives up on me/us.\n\nIf anyone else is in a position like mine (ADHD significant other/non-medicated) words of advice and thoughts would be nice to hear! It is great to know there is support for people with ADHD as well as their loved ones!\n"""

Nowadays it takes approx. 3 minutes or walking or even just 1 minute of bending/squatting before the pain gets unbearable, to which its only relieved when sitting down or laying down.

He said that due to the location of the pain (always above my left eye) it sounds like **neuropathy**. I\'m going to have a MRI done in the next couple weeks or so. For now, he gave me an Rx for Nabumetone (2x a day) and Topiramate (only to be taken after a week if the first Rx isn\'t cutting it). edit: never ended up taking the Topiramate as the side-effects sounds potentially horrible. I had an MRI & CT Scan (""Cat Scan"") done, but the GP said they were inconclusive. :| I am glad, however, that nothing serious was found! \n\n**Update 2:** Finally saw an EN&T Doc yesterday. I have a deviated septum from breaking my nose when I was a teenager. He *thinks* this *could* be the cause of my headaches since the bones in my nose were shifted over to the left and the ""pressure"" (and pain from the headaches) is consistently above my left eye. ***However***, he said the corrective surgery is a ""50/50 shot"" for helping with the headaches, which is a joke to me....I\'m not going to have a surgery if the odds are not better than 50/50! Really quite disappointed in how inconclusive and wishy-washy this doctor was. He even looked at the MRI and CT Scans, and that\'s the best he could do. \n\n**Update 3:** I\'ve noticed that **eating seems to be a headache trigger** for me, but as of yet I can\'t identify what food/s. I am keeping a food diary and so far pizza and an Asian noodle bowl have been the worst offenders. As silly as it might sound, I\'m *thinking* **gluten** is the commonality there.

So my 18 birthday comes around feeling confident because I lost 44 lbs, only then suddenly acne comes around and unlike before it was alot. So I decide to go to my GP again he decides to prescribe me tetracycline, mean while I get depressed, I am afraid to go outside and as a result dropped out of college and rarely came outside. Luckily my parents are understanding and understood that pushing me to go outside would just make me more miserable. Anyway the tetracycline made me noxious all the time and barely put a dent in the acne, so he prescribes me doxycycline and after that minocycline, all that didnt work and just made me hopeless since 4 months had passed and my life is put on hold. My GP forwarded me to a dermatologist who prescribed me accutane 40mg a day and needed to get a bloodtest done monthly and told me to read the side effects. 1 month passes by havent noticed any side effects and the size of the pimples had decreased significantly only problem the bloodtest came out a bit worry some so the dermatologist decided to reduce it to 30mg a day month two comes along the acne has dissapeared almost completely and only red scars remain and some pimples, bloodtest is good so it keeps going this way a few months pass and I am starting to get back into life I am going outside again meeting my friends etc I apply for college again everything goes great the only side effects are dry lips, dry eyes in the morning and backpain/legpain after working out. The treatment goes on and after a year of taking accutane I have zero pimples and zero blackheads and best of all life is smiling again for me. This was 4 months ago and my skin is almost the same as when I quit accutane. The only permenant side effect is mildly dry lips.

Big Fat yes, also my kiddos had it, we all did. We tried doing a bit of herbal treatment first but then we ended up taking the 10 day metronidazol treatment. It was like being high all the time, and feeling really weird. After, no giardia... Still now, no reoccuring giardia. I had about 15 tests so its very much tested. My real problems started shortly after .... J thought i could finally have fun again! But no.... I started getting serious episodes of diarrhoea (and serious panic attacks) i started losing weight ... And the diarrhoea would not stop. Until summer... Then i could suddenly wat again without having constant diarrhoea. In the meantime i had seen a gastro and they detected that my stool had a much too hight undigested dat in it so they gave me enzymes. That didnt really do much... So i stopped. I just felt different, then my back started to feel inflamed and i could hardly walk. Nausia always by my side.. its like i was (am) a ghost of this person i used to be. After summer i had some beers (i dont really drink alcohol) and that night my stomach e started making the strangest sounds and all the horror came back, diarrhoea, and all the time... I was in so much pain also because my anu had an abcess that i hadtoo go to hospital for, they opened it, gave me antibiotics (i couldnt finish the course of antibiotics because it made me even sicker) but the abcess now has turned into 2 fistulas. So... Then i went on a fodmap dieet in december wich felt really good for a while but within three weeks diarrhoea started coming back again, and dit stopping. So i went back to only white bread. I always have gas , and constant pain in the bowels. My ears are always ringing and i am exhausted. I was just admitted in hospital this week. Because i had lost so much minerals etc. I was there for a night, but now in back.

For example, sometimes people mistake a symptom (from an illness) or a side effect of penicillin for an allergic reaction. \n\nLike any other medicine (or antibiotic), even penicillin can show some side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache or thrush. But these are common side effects and are not allergic reactions. \n\nThe experts also focused on the interesting fact that penicillin allergies are not life-long. Like food allergies, people can overcome their allergies to penicillin antibiotics. According to them, 80% of people who were allergic to penicillin recovered from their allergy after about 10 years. \n\nWide use of broad-spectrum antibiotics has led to a greater chance of antibiotic resistance and the potential to create superbugs (strains of bacteria that are resistant to most antibiotics). \n\nAlso, the broad spectrum antibiotics kill a wide range of bacteria which sounds great, but when we say ""a broad range"", we also include the good bacteria that are responsible for our healthy gut. These antibiotics disturb the gut flora. \n\nWhat can be done?\n\nAccording to experts, it is always good to take a detailed history of the patient, which should include\n\n\tA detailed history of the antibiotic to which they reacted.\n\n\tThe reaction that occurred after taking that antibiotic. \n\n\tCheck the medical records of the patient.'"
dilaudid,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pe99gl/i_dont_wanna_do_this_anymore/,"b""I don't wanna do this anymore.""",,"b""I'm not a big reddit poster but what I have to say.. I'd like at least a select people to hear it. Idk if I can help anybody but if it helps you to know people are going through the same thing, I'll tell you I'm going through it. I'm a 26 yo male, and used to be the happiest man, without a problem in the world. It all started when I was about 16/17 years old. I had chronic pain and severe kidney problems. I went to multiple doctors searching for a cure or a procedure that would return me to normal. None of the doctors I visited seemed very interested in fixing my issue as they did in just prescribing me narcotics. I was pretty straight laced and at first wasn't even interested at all in taking these medications. I just wanted my problems fixed. However, the doctors insisted and quite literally talked me into taking these medications that controlled me with script after script coming for the better part or 4 years. Here I sit now, after 8 surgeries and probably close to 100 prescriptions for oxycodone, Vicodin, Dilaudid, and yes, even fentanyl. Wishing I would have just dealt with the pain and never given in to taking the narcotics even once. Addiction is such a real thing and it can happen to anyone. I hate to say I'm not at fault for this because I'm sure some of the blame is on me. But this cycle of addiction, depression, and suicidal thoughts and actions would likely not be there if it wasn't for me being given script after script and forcefed pills since I was a teenager. Now I buy drugs from the streets just to feel anything and I just wish more than anything that one day I can put this neverending cycle behind me. I'm sorry for the rant guys and thank you to anyone that takes the time to read this. For reference, this was in the US during probably 2012-2017 when so many doctors were getting in trouble with the law for over prescribing opioid medications. We hear all over the news about what happens to these doctors and pharmacists... But what about the likely hundreds of thousands of lives that were impacted by them getting patients hooked on pain killers, forcing them to either go through constant depression, pain, and withdrawal symptoms (which sometimes feel worse than death itself), or going out and finding these drugs elsewhere and buying them for their own use. This is what led to such a major opiate epidemic in the states, and why so many have lost their lives to this painful and seemingly impossible to escape cycle. Again, sorry for the rant. I love you guys """

corticosteroid swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/e0ggiu/a_25_year_medical_mystery_first_youre_a/,"b""A 25 year medical mystery. First you're a hypochondriac, then you're a drug seeker, finally they admit it is a real, possibly unknown physical disease that may never be diagnosed. Please help!""",,"b'Hello everyone, 25 year old male, 130lbs, 5\'10"" tall, on medications: Dexamethasone, Toradol, generic anti-histamines, corticosteroid puffer, sometimes antibiotics. Family history of: heart disease, kidney disease, various cancers (prostate, thyroid, pancreatic), autoimmune & heamatological disease (Lupus, Thalassemia, Ulcerative colitis, autoimmume thyroid disease, diabetes, Psoriasis)\n\nAfter visiting countless doctors and emergency rooms/hospitals, I am coming here out of desparation after the best doctor in Ontario admitted that my case has him stumped. I am deteriorating faster than ever and I know I do not have much longer to live\n \nSymptoms =\n\n-- Unexplained & recurring fevers, with meningitis type symptoms of stiff & painful neck, base of skull pain, photophobia as well as sudden swelling of eyes with a lot of puss-like crust that seals them shut, swelling of wrist, ankles, feet, throat, uvula, ears, sometimes other tissues / organs as well, and a general feeling of being deathly ill. These ""attacks"" / ""episodes"" last anywhere from 2 days to 4 or 5 weeks. \n\n-- Localized hives with redness around them, these hives have an itchy burn to them and either pop up at random, or after exposure to sunlight, artificial lights, or water. Can happen anywhere on the body but a small circular area. I chalked this up to ""allergies"" for years but lately Ive noticed it doesn\'t matter what season it is & eliminating food that could cause allergies has been completely ineffective. Interestingly the association between water & this symptom has always been evident\n\n-- Widespread area mainly top of hands up to eblows where all of the skin develops a bright red tone, becomes itchy, and feels like a 2nd degree burn. Wrapping with cold clothes and other physical traditional burn treatments helps\n\n-- large red area, with angry red circle in center, with a whitehead. Usually these are small but sometimes they swell up massively & prevent sitting or laying down properly. They appear to be infections but antibiotics does nothing whereas corticosteroids & toradol help (both for this and many other symptoms this holds true)\n\nActual infections:\n1. Gangrene of toe / foot (that needed lancing and draining but started going septic despite that treatment)\n2. Respiratory, bronch/strep at the same time 2 years in a row confirmed by culture\n3. Skin / muscle, these are rare compared to the phenomena that are clearly not infections due to their response to medication, but when it happens it is usually more severe and immediate responds to antibiotics so its obvious\n\n-- Extremely fast / thick skin growth on bottom lip & bottoms of feet, both left and right. Hands used to be unaffected. The thick skins color is very yellow on the soles of feet but not the other areas which has led to less worry about my liver than I think is necessary (Jaundice of mucus membranes / general skin jaundice has been noted in my ER records). The thick skin is very painful and causes the healthy skin around it to split and tear open from pressure, causing bleeding and dramatically increasing the local risk of infection. Worst area is the feet. A 2 or 3 inch thick layer of skin grows even when I am off my feet which is almost always now. Doctor thought it was classic callous when I was more active, but ended up classifying it as Hyperkeratosis once it became apparent that activity or pressure wasn\'t the cause. If the skin is cut off or treated in any way it comes back more aggresively, growing quicker than before and expands further. If it is not treated, it grows at a fast rate still but causes the skin around it to split open from the tightness etc. Very frustrating and debilitating. No treatments or remedies have prevented it from reoccuring or reduced the severity\n\n-- Hundreds of scars / stretch mark looking things primarily around my buttocks and thighs and knees, these are unexplained by growth, weight gain/loss or any other common cause\n\n-- Spontaneous bleeding, coughing up large amounts of blood, bright red poo, and one time where I woke up feeling deathly ill and nauseated & threw up a nice brownish redish coffee ground style sludge... And a lot of it\n\n-- Bright purple/pinkish urine, or dark brown/black urine that is always abnormally foamy and has a white subatance settle at the bottom\n\n-- Thick, almost jello consistency / rubbery consistency phlegm. When I cough up stuff I could literally chew it if I wanted like a piece of meat or gum or roll it into a ball in my fingers. The mucous/phlegm is usually yellow, brown or blackish \n\n-- Shortness of breath\n\n-- Heart racing, gets worse with even mild excersize, and episodes of fainting due to standing or switching position too quickly\n\n-- Hearing imparment from very young/birth in left ear & total inability to smell\n\n-- Vision loss getting progressively worse\n\n-- Metallic taste in mouth\n\n-- Massive & excruciatingly painful hematomas / fluid under skin even after very minor injuries\n\n-- Superhuman metabolic rate... Always been very thin really, despite for years now I have eatten almost 10000 calories a day. That\'s right... Not 1000... ten thousand calories a day! Definitely over 5 thousand, and I have never been able to gain weight except one short period of my life and I could not identify why I was able to put on weight at that time. In recent months I have given up my extreme eating habit as it seems to have no effect on my nutrition or ability to be healthy, amd probably consume from 2000 to 4000 cal a day and have plateaued where I do not gain weight but am also not losing weight anymore\n\n-- Dental problems, early extractions etc despite being born with ""perfect teeth"" and taking care of them\n\n-- Flank pain made worse by eating, made better after pooing\n\n-- Sparse, thick, coarse hair everywhere except head, pubic area. Those 2 areas have more normal feeling hair and its denser there. Hair grows slowly everywhere except those 2 areas. If you shave my leg it will grow back over months but if you shave my head I\'ll have a full head of hair in a few weeks. \n\n-- Brittle, fast growing nails & deformed baby toenail on each foot (mother has the same issue with baby toes on each of her feet)\n\n-- Chest pain, back pain, bone pain, muscle pain\n\n-- Muscle spasms so severe they cause my fingers / toes to twist all weird and lock themselves up. Think of the foot cramp after swimming but your entire leg, arm, hand or foot & it happens at random when you move or use a muscle or muscle group\n\n-- Sudden, temporary lower limb paralysis documented at least 4 times by my medical records\n\n-- Sensitive to cold\n\n-- Nose bleeds\n\n-- Drenching night sweats\n\nNervous system / pain receptor defect... A  wound on finger causes pain in ribs, back or leg for example. Especially when the wound is touched while healing. Another example is; wound on my leg will hurt and cause the same pain happening in that area, but in my abdominal area, or arms as well \n\n-- Easy bruising, bone breaks, slow healing \n\n-- Ridiculous / out of proportion strength or ability to harness adrenaline? At my sickest point in recent times I was still able to lift a 350 to 450 pound object up multiple flights of stairs, being the only person on one side and the other side needing 3 or 4 men much larger than myself and they could hardly do it. This isn\'t the only example of my strength being out of proportion to what I SHOULD be capable of especially given my physical condition, but it is the most obvious example\n\nAnd many many more physical issues.

I'd be better of asking my dentist go through the on duty dental doctor (Not verbatim).   \n\n\nAnyway I phoned her back and communicated this and she said that I should come back for her to inspect me again.   \n\n\nShe explained that sinus had been perforated and that I will need to see a specialist and that she'll refer me and in the mean time to take antibiotics. She showed me my xray which illustrated how my roots actually go deep into my sinus floor.  She said it wasn't severe enough to merit going to A&E but if the pain gets much worse to go straight to A&E. (Not verbatim).   \n\n\nOnce I get home after going to the chemist I see that she's prescribed me amoxicillin. I have a suspected allergy to penicillin which has never been confirmed. (I was given it once and had a bad rash come up all over my body.)\n\nI told them on my registration form about my suspected allergy so I was dejected to get home only to realise I cant take the medicine I've been prescribed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Tuesday  I phone and explained and I was told they thought I only had a slight allergy which is why they prescribed me amoxicillin.

I wasn't made aware of the risk of a perforated sinus. I wasn't made aware that I might have to to A&E should that happen. I was sent away completely unaware that I had a perforated sinus. I was then prescribed medication that I have a suspected allergy to.   \n\n\nI would really appreciate some experienced impartial perspective on what has gone on.  \n\nEdit:\nI drink on the weekends and quit smoking two months ago. \n\nThanks in advance !"""

Ever since I've had mild pain in the area and just hoped it would get better. The dentist even suggested at my cleaning a month or so ago that it could get better but if it didn't I'd need a root canal. Fast forward to a few days ago and the pain starts to get worse. Decide I need to call the specialist to be seen. Yesterday it takes a way worse turn and my pain level has reached unbearable. I called my regular dentist first and the prescribed Penicillin VK and Tylenol #3. I made an appt for mid September to be seen by specialist but my pain kept getting worse. So I called around and got an appt for tomorrow, Wednesday with the time needed to do a root canal if needed. I'm still in extreme agony. Is this normal? It feels like I have pain in other teeth now too and radiating into my eyes and skull and neck. Am I going to be okay until tomorrow? What else can I do on these medications?"""

I would get severe insomnia and extreme fatigue at the same time. At first I'd fall into complete fatigue, extremely tired and exhausted. My muscles would continue to spasm and cause cramps. I'd lie in bed for days not getting up. Then days would follow of insomnia and not being able to sleep. After trying it the thoughts in my head got so much worse and constant. They became obsessive and more aggressive. I even had an episode of bad spasms. I could not possibly sit still or lie down yet I was so tired and struggled to keep moving. I was on an airplane and started going up and down the aircraft screaming I needed an ambulance. Since I was a minor and my guardian didn't authorise to get off the airplane I was stuck. That went on for a long period of time while they were fixing the aircraft. It even caused my jaw muscles to start moving and do weird things to my face. I ended up having to take 8 lorazepam pills to relax me. The effects continued to last for days after. Horrible experience, will literally make me pass out anywhere.

If you dont want to read the whole thing, Ive got highlights towards the end of this post.\n\nBasically, I've been checked up for testicular, abdominal pain and all lots of weird symptoms over the course of the past month. Symptoms show up, sometimes they go intermittent.\n\nA doctor in the ER gave me the possibility to do a CT scan for both the abdomen and the pelvis. However, as I am 20 years old and did multiple radiography tests already, I'm wondering if I should really do it.\n\nHere is the summary of my symptoms and whatnot during the last month (if symptoms do not show again, assume they are partially or totally gone) :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWeek 1 :\n\nSymptoms :\n\n\\- Testicular pain (7-8/10 when it first hit)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiagnostic :\n\n\\- Epididymitis (non-STD related). On week 3 I got told it was just a random bacteria (couldve gone away by itself without antibiotics)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMedication | dose | times taken :\n\n\\- Naproxen | 500mg | twice daily for 7 days\n\n\\- Ciprofloxacin | 500 mg | twice daily for 7 days\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWeek 2 :\n\nSymptoms (cause?) :\n\n\\- Pain on right flank, worse when laying down on one side (pain 8/10 when laying down, else intermittent)\n\n\\- Not feeling there, as in almost-depersonification (medication?)\n\n\\- Lessened testicle pain\n\n\\- Groin pain/discomfort\n\n\\- Big loss of appetite (can still eat a bit)\n\n\\- Nausea, close to vomiting\n\n\\- Tired (sleep schedule messed up by hospital visits late at night)\n\n\\- Heart palpitations\n\n\\- Pain on upper left of the chest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTests and diagnostic :\n\n\\- Seen doctor, no diagnostic.

All negative results. My blood was A+\n\n\\- Echography for epididymitis recidivism, radiologist said the epididymis is fine.\n\n\\- I am ordered an abdomen and pelvis scan THAT I NEED TO DECIDE ON. The doctor gave me the sheet and told me to take the decision by myself rather or not I want to do the CT scan. I am unsure because of the radiation. I did 3 x-rays, a head CT (daily headaches) and would now do this CT scan in this past month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiagnostic :\n\n\\- None\n\nMedication :\n\n\\- Over-the-counter meds, on need. Taking acetaminophen reg. for daily headaches\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday (week 5) :\n\nSymptoms :\n\n\\- Testicle pain (1-7/10, for some reason worse at 4-5 pm but discomfort/pain throughout the day, averages 3/10)\n\n\\- Same abdominal pain, sometimes hangs lower. Will be mild sometimes.\n\n\\- Groin discomfort/pain\n\n\\- Discomfort in pubic area and in right leg near hip bone sometimes\n\n\\- Easily fatigued, exhausted at 5pm, where I wasnt usually\n\n\\- 2/10 dizziness\n\n\\- 2/10 confusion\n\n\\- Feeling drunk/feeling not there\n\n\\- Very occasional diarrhea\n\n\\- Occasional nausea\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiagnostic :\n\n\\- None, havent gotten to the hospital as Im still thinking if I should go do my CT scan (ref to week 4 tests).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMedication :\n\n\\- Over-the-counter meds, tempted to take ibuprofen for my abdominal pain but Im abstaining. Acetaminophen for daily headaches, almost once daily. Had amitriptyline but doctor ordered me to stop for a while because red dots on skin for a day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHighlights of the entire month :\n\n\\- Testicular pain, diagnosed non-STD related epididymitis with a bacteria that could've gone away by itself apparently. Took Ciprofloxacin. Week 4, testicle pain comes back in 75% strength at times. Groin discomfort.\n\n\\- Abdomen pain which started at the right flank but moved to the right of the navel but on the same Y-axis. Now some hip bone/pubic area discomfort.\n\n\\- Couldnt eat much at all on week 2 and high-level nausea but no vomiting.\n\n\\- One doctor pressed hard on the spot near my navel and it would hurt as he presses down. Same doctor told me all this could be anxiety, but I am not stressed and still feel symptoms.\n\n\\- Since week 4, easily tired, 2/10 dizziness, 2/10 confusion, occasional nausea.\n\n\\- Doctor told me I have to decide if I want to do a CT scan for abdomen and pelvis. Its a lot of radiation, I am 20 years old and already did 3 x-rays and a head CT the past month (daily headaches).\n\n\\- Been on naproxen for 2 weeks.\n\n\\- Some heart burn symptoms throughout week 2. Very occasional now.\n\n\\- Need to take ginger Gravol, ibuprofen, sleeping pill in order to function normally sometimes (I use them less and less nowadays)\n\n\\- For fever, I've been constantly in between 37.5-37.8 celcius with a rectal thermometer, which is almost-fever.\n\n\\- I can still work my student job, even with all the symptoms.\n\n\\- When I'm distracted, symptoms are lessened. But they are still annoying.\n\n\\- Multiple blood tests and urine tests came out fine (all negative) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestions/interrogations I have :\n\n1. Should I do the abdomen and pelvis CT scan (under the context I mentioned)?\n2. Should I be concerned with the fact that it could be a missed appendicitis?\n3. Should I be concerned of sepsis? Long shot, but asking.\n4. Could all this be related to the Ciprofloxacin I took?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all very much for your answers. My morale has been quite down this past month."""

Been to 4 dermatologists, no one can help'",Image979.jpg,"b""Hi\n\nI've had a staph infection on the lip over the past months. It was treated with mupriocin (bactroban) in my nose & on the lips with mupriocin and an ointment with fusidic acid. My lips got better but right now it's like in the picture and they REALLY burn. The culture swab did not show anything special (no staph anymore). Blood test & swab also showed I don't have the herpes virus.\n\nI don't use anything with SLS or fluoride, I have not used any makeup or perfume for the past month, I always drink with a straw and I've been eating with a little desert fork for the past few months so food won't get on my lips. My derm prescribed me antibiotics to take orally (Bactrim) but it did not help as well. I only use Dexeryl cream and an Uriage balm (both prescribed by my dermatologist).\n\nAnd I have switched 4 dermatologists, two of them were professors and still they all just suggest I use hydrocortisone but idk if that's a long term solution? Also no one will tell me what exactly this is. I just can't believe there is literally no doctor in the world who can recognize this disease. I have troubles with my lips since November 2021 and it might sound silly but it really ruined my social life and my mental health. So ANY tips would be so so so welcome\n\nUPD 21 June 2022: it got worse (yellow crust) so I went to see the allergist yesterday. Probably allergic eczema developed because of using too much/too often mupriocin, fucidic acid, different lip balms and hydrating substances. Getting a patch test in august, until then I shouldn't use ANYTHING near my lips, preferably nothing on my whole face for 2 months & hydrocortisone 2 x a day for 2 weeks, then 1 x a day 2 weeks then stop or use it once a week & they advised me to check my blood for vitamines. Also, according to the docs an allergy for vaseline is very very very rare so I am allowed to still use plain vaseline. Let's wait and see. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0gpmam8ptf691.png?width=996&format=png&auto=webp&s=610bc28f54b8b5abc8355468381882ee54de521f\n\nUPD 28 July 2022:\nSo after using cortisone 2x a day for 2 weeks, I switched to 1 x a day and it immediately got worse. I was super sad and hopeless but went back to 2 x a day for another week. After, tried 1 x a day for a week again and my lips seemed to stay normal. So I tried to reduce the usage of hydrocortisone and applied it every other day for a week. And then reduce it again. Today Im off hydrocortisone for exactly 1 week and my lips are okay. Sure, you still see where it all started (some parts of my upper lip are darker than normal) and when I eat, the outer line of my underlip gets super red, but thats it. Otherwise I have only used Vaseline since the last time Ive been to the doctor. No makeup on the face, no facewash etc. Still planning on seeing the derm for the patch test in august. Very curious to understand what has happened and why my lips went back to normal (thank God for that tho). I hope this positive result is not temporary.\n\nUPD 31 July: jinxed it, got red small bumps again. Used hydrocortisone, this will probably help. 10 days without it, personal record.\n\nUPD 12 September: +- one month eczema free. The patch test showed that Im slightly allergic to nickel, so I stopped wearing my rings (normally I wore them everyday). Anyway idk if the eczema went away because of that (I do wear my rings once in a couple of days now, and it doesnt come back) or because of some other reason. I was told its possible that if you reduce your level of stress it just stops. That could be the case for me. Or nickel. Idk. Just happy its over. \n\nThe only thing that doesnt go away is the red dark line on my underlip. That one didnt go away even when I was using hydrocortisone, so the derm suggested to use protopic for a couple of weeks for that particular spot. According to her there are no negative consequences of protopic but idk somehow I just dont trust it. Anyone any experience with protopic on the lips ? (Tacrolimus)\n\nUPD 19 September: I used b5 cicaplast lipbalm from La Roche Posay yesterday and woke up with blisters this morning. Idk of its related, but switch of the balm (I normally use Uriage) is the only change (except for stress and less sleep) in my routine from the past month. Very confusing because the allergy test showed Im not allergic to this balm (took it with me to patch test). So now back to hydrocortisone and I hope it will go away AND STAY AWAY.\n\nUPD 16 November: Im doing fine, problem seems to be solved by not wearing any rings and not using the la roche posay balm. My derm said is possible the patch test did not show allergy to this balm because the allergy is minor, while the skin on my lips was thinned by hydrocortisone and extra sensitive from all the medication I used so it seems legit to her that I get a reaction on my lips and not on my back where the skin is thicker. Anyway, if you are still reading here, it means you are struggling as well and are looking for any help. Those would be my tips for anyone going through the same thing:\n- have culture tests to exclude any bacterial infections \n- WASH YOUR HANDS\n- dont eat spicy food\n- dont drink with a metal straw in case you might be allergic for nickel \n- have an allergy test (might show nothing, might show something, but at least youd know)\n- stop using ANY products on your skin around the lips except for pure Vaseline\n- give it TIME! It took literally 1 year for my lips to heal. Between the worse outbreaks and complete healing +- 5 months. Your skin needs time, your life isnt ruined even if it might seem like it is sometimes."""

This is a big part of the reason I have self esteem issues today, and why I started to see a therapist a little while ago. I was diagnosed since I was in about 1st grade and since then for most of my life I have struggled to maintain concentration and focus. This goes for school, work and activities I enjoy. Part of the reason I resisted all forms of help for my ADHD is that I thought it made me dumber than other people which is why I always just rejected the idea I had a disability.\n\nI'm at the point in my life now where I want to start being more independent and not rely on my  grandmother for things I can do on my own. But I can never seem to sit down and learn something. When I'm doing research, reading or even listening to something my mind goes to a million things at once, even when I'm invested in it. Even typing this out right now is taking forever because I keep losing focus on what I'm typing and get distracted by random thoughts about nothing.\n\n After talking to my therapist for a bit I came to the realization that I had to acknowledge that fact that I had ADHD. And if I want to get better and improve my life than I had to come to terms and start treating my ADHD.\n\nI want to start by saying I am very hesitant about medication, not completely 100% opposed to it just very hesitant. I'm a guy who has never liked the idea of taking things that can mess with my mind/body. I have never drank alcohol or smoked anything in my life and don't plan to, I don't even drink coffee or energy drinks either. Part of this is do to the fact that I don't want to be addicted to anything as I have an addictive personality and I don't want to have anything I can get addicted to that is bad for me. Even when I have headaches or any pain I almost never even take an advil unless I get a doctor's recommendation or if the pain is just unbearable. Another reason I  also never want to not be myself. I had a friend in high school who took medication for his ADHD. The few times that he didn't it was like he was like a whole other person, just very unhinged and excessive. I don't know if that will be me If i start medicating or who i will be when I'm on/off it and it scares me to think about it. Then again idk if my friend had others problems or if he needed other medication so he might be a different story. Also  if I get on medication will I need to take it all the time to maintain focus or will I forever have to rely on it.\n\nIf possible I'd like to sharpen my focus without medication. I have been trying meditation for the past couple of days but it has been challenging to say the least. Like it almost hurts my mind to try to stay focused on one thing for more than a few seconds. Maybe it will get better over time because I just started but it's really disheartening. I'd also like to know what other people do to battle or overcome their ADHD because right now I only know of medication and meditation. \n\nBut maybe the most important thing to me is that I don't want people to know I have ADHD. It seems contrary to what other people say here but to me I'd rather be seen as lazy, uncaring, dumb and unmotivated than seen as someone with a disability. Even me saying that I have a disability to myself makes me cringe, it make me feel like I'm not normal. It probably has a lot to do with my mom and how I grew up but acknowledging I have a disability to me makes me feel like I'm below other people and that I'm stupid. This is the reason why I have repressed this and is one the reasons I'm so insecure and have low self esteem. The only people that know about this are my family and a few close friends, and I'd like to keep it that way.\n\nMy therapist said that how I may choose to go about working of my ADHD is up to me and me alone, and that they will do there best to support me no matter my choice, but that accepting that I need to work of it may be for the best and may be key part to improving my life and fixing my self esteem issues. I know now if I don't start trying to take these steps to fix myself it will never get any better. And after finding this subreddit where people seem to be open talking about this it makes me feel not alone and like I can talk about this. So I'd thought I'd share what I had to say and maybe see if anyone had any advice for me. But don't worry I'm going to do my own research as well so I can be well informed.\n\nThanks if you read this to the end, sorry I'm not the best writer. If I didn't make something clear or messed up something let me know."""

I told him about the first time, got my antibiotic, and it cleared up.\n\n(Historically penicillin and I have had a great relationship when it comes to infections)\n\nIn February, it happened again (34yrs). I had since gotten a new ENT since my other one retired. I told him that this has happened two more times before, but cleared up with a standard course of antibiotics. He saw some redness, but it wasnt too bad. He concluded it may be viral, and put me on a week-long prednisone taper.\n\nFor the duration of the prednisone taper, I felt fine. The first day of no prednisone - it came back. I didnt have the ability to go back to the ENT so soon again, so I just kind of *hoped* itd go away.\n\nThen it go weird - because it DID. Sort of.\n\nIt actually would go away and come back intermittently in the last two months. It sort of changed when it presented, but it was a spicy/itchy throat.\n\nI went back to the ENT yesterday because I had the time, and also because my throat was KILLING ME non-stop (minus sleeping) the last 5 days. Interchangeable episodes of non-stop itching that maked me want to scratch it with a fork (never did) and then non-stop spicy feeling like I had eaten jalapeos. It had also started to move to my tongue. It made everything kind of worse to do, nothing helped - no antihistamines, otc pain med, nyquil, afrin, water, etc. helped.\n\nHe looked and there were no additional symptoms. No GERD issues (Im on meds). Hes ruled out strep, tonsillitis, leukemia/cancer. He caved and gave me the antibiotic (its been over 5yrs since Ive taken any). He gave me some other comfort measures, as well.\n\nMy mom was surprised he didnt do a culture to see what KIND of bacteria may be causing this.

cyclobenzaprine,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ww348o/i_dont_know_how_to_help_my_mom/,b'I dont know how to help my mom',,"b'My mom has always struggled with depression and anxiety. Over the past couple years its gotten progressively and then exponentially worse. Its now reached a stage of paranoia and delusions and repetitive behaviors and comments. Its almost like she has dementia except we think she might be misusing if not abusing her medication. \n\nTo prelude this, shes been prescribed a host of heavy meds for a long time, most of them to sleep. At night she takes Xanax, Cyclobenzaprine, trazadone, and some other stuff. Both of my parents are deaf. My dad is very successful, outgoing, and happy. My mom is kind of the opposite. She wouldnt be able to survive without my dad. Which is fine, because she doesnt have to. None of this has to do with their deafness. Its just who they are. But its getting to the point where my mom can barely function let alone be normal. \n\nSo about a year and a half ago she stopped smoking weed, which helped with her pain. She didnt like some of the side effects it gave her. Thats when she started going downhill. At first she thought she was withdrawing from weed. Then she started having neck pain. Over time the neck pain spread to her back, which then became pelvic pain. All the while her depression and anxiety get worse and worse. She tried different antidepressants and couldnt stick to any of them. We think shes stopped taking her meds as prescribed, both on purpose and because shes lost the ability to keep track. One time she told me she took four Xanax because she couldnt sleep. \n\nShes always had chronic pain, and Ive always chalked it up to her depression and anxiety, and it turns out I was right. But now its gotten so bad that shes not even talking about her different maladies. Shes gone crazy. She says her and my dad are broke, when theyre absolutely not broke. I know for a fact that my dad has a seven figure net worth at least because Ive seen some of his finances personally. Also, I run his business now. She also says me and my fianc are broke. She says my dad is going senile. She says she has an infection because theres poop in her blood. I mistakenly told her that this would be sepsis and she would be dying, and then she said she was going to look up sepsis. She claims shes been pooping her pants, and maybe she has, but she refuses to go anywhere out of embarrassment. \n\nIve always known that to some degree shes been hooked on her prescriptions. Naturally shes physically dependent on them. But I didnt really think she was this attached, to the point where shed completely fuck her mind up to continue using them. Its not until relatively recently, after I went to rehab and stopped abusing drugs, that I realized shes probably been deteriorating for a long time. I used to be so angry at her as a kid because she couldnt process things on the same level as me or other people. I thought she was just an idiot. Now I look back and realize I was getting angry at someone who needed help. My dad probably shouldve realized this too, but hes like a golden retriever. Hes just happy and as long as things are relatively okay around him he doesnt ask many questions. \n\nAnyway, my mom has been in therapy and seen psychiatrists. We have taken my mom to the ER to try and get her help. They just processed her, asked her if she was going to hurt herself, whether she wanted to stay, and let her go. After getting rejected from the Mayo Clinic, Ive gotten her appointments at the Cleveland Clinic. But theyre not until November 17. That seems like way too much time. It took forever for me to get her psychiatrist to fill out the intake referral form for Johns Hopkins. That has another long waiting list anyway. \n\nThe Cleveland Clinic will provide a holistic diagnosis, which is what I think she needs. She needs a doctor to look at her head to toe and begin working at the root causes, which probably involves getting her off a lot of the junk shes on and seeing whats really plaguing her. \n\nBut until then, I have absolutely no idea what to do. Theres no program or doctor or anything for this. None of the doctors shes seen have really cared or tried to help her beyond the obviously bunk complaints she brings to them. Shes clearly a psychiatric patient and yet no one has been able to help. Her psychs just keep writing scripts, her therapists dont help even though theyve tried, no one provides any sort of relief. Its hard to imagine just sitting around and waiting for almost three months. Ive talked to so many people to try and figure out someplace for her. No one knows anything. Im getting so pissed off that no one can help her.'"

My insurance covers nothing until I meet my deductible... I have generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and depression.  Probably undiagnosed ADHD.\n\nMy history: \n\nI was on sertraline for years in my early 20s.  It would make me nauseous but help the  depression ease up a little. Wasn\'t super great but it worked ok.  I was also on atenolol for social anxiety. I liked my doctor and she understood my issues with needles/doctors and never pressured me.\n\nI moved states and had to find a new doctor, but the one i ended up going to made my have a panic attack.  I wasn\'t able to get myself to go to a doctor for a few years so I ran out of meds and ended up off of them. \n\nI have been slowly getting worse and worse. I\'m flip flopping between unbearably anxious always and extremely depressed with tiny spurts of feeling really good and doing allllll the things. Mind racing all over the place, anxious, worrying about everything, beating myself up for not doing more or getting better to being just numb, doing nothing. Most of the time I feel ""stuck"" just unable to get anything done, dont enjoy anything, cant take care of my house, sometimes its a battle just to get myself to eat food. I go through periods of using exercise as a coping mechanism/distraction to just not working out at all. When I manage to find a hyperfixation for a few days, its so wonderful to be able to do something (even if its not any of the stuff I need to do).\n\nThis summer(July), after months of agony over finding a pcp, I tried to get back on the sertraline and atenolol and not only did it not help, but I was so incredibly nauseous I would throw up multiple times every day.

She tried to refer me to her ""usual"" psychiatrist but they weren\'t accepting new patients so I was on my own finding one. \n\nRecently (September), I started seeing a PMHNP. She said that I probably have undiagnosed ADHD and probably some OCD in addition to my anxiety/depression. The ADHD was not surprising, I\'ve been wondering that for a while. But the OCD was a surprise. She referred me to psychiatric testing for an official diagnosis but it looked like it would cost $2-3k, which I don\'t have. So she started me on wellbutrin xl. It seemed to work at first with a side effect of me being very spacey and forgetful.  Now it doesn\'t help with my anxiety and depression at all, and the spaceyness and forgetfulness is still present. Its ruining my job performance and I still don\'t feel better. She mentioned vyvanse would probbaly be her move, but Id need an official ADHD diagnosis.\n\nI\'m trying so hard to find the right person and treatment but theres so many options out there and its just so so expensive and taxing on me. I just don\'t know what to do. But I am very aware that Im just getting worse. I dont leave my house. I don\'t see people. I wear headphones at the grocery store to avoid others. I lay in bed for hours doing nothing. I will spend all weekend beating myself up for not being able to do anything- cleaning dishes, any sort of fun hobby, watching a show. I do dance and learn dance choreographies from home because it helps my brain shut off, so I think I get plenty of exercise. But even then I struggle to get myself to start/ enjoy it very often.\n\nAm I on the right path?  Do I go back to the PMHNP? How could I get an official diagnosis without the price tag of $2-3k? \n\nI\'m so overwhelmed with making decisions, any guidance would be appreciated.\n\nThank you'"

Bit of a weird one - will be long but might be of professional interest to dentists so I wont try to edit too much. \n\nAn appointment with paediatric dentistry at our local hospital appointment is upcoming and Im posting here to try and formulate useful questions to ask at the appointment rather than hoping for definitive answers.\n\nProblem: My daughter is 10 and a half and seems to have multiple additional teeth, top and bottom, both at the front of the mouth and at the rear. \n\nAt least one is completely erupted, another partially erupted. So far they look fairly well formed and much like the teeth they are beside. \n\nShe also has multiple areas in the gum that have that strained skin look with what appears to be white bumps behind. I suspect she has at least 5 extra teeth, perhaps more. \nHer adult teeth are looking crowded and she is complaining of pain, which seems to be a combo of normal eruption pain plus pressure on neighbouring teeth.\n\nHer older half brother (21) had one additional tooth that was little and malformed and was extracted before he had a brace fitted - no big deal.\n\nBackground: My daughter has an extremely complicated medical history, having been diagnosed with a rare life threatening immune disorder ([secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis triggered by EBV - Epstein Barr virus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5766650/)) just before her 7th birthday. \nThe hospital dental department initially saw her while in paediatric ICU - this was purely because (like all 6 year olds) she had several wobbly teeth - these were dentist-extracted to avoid any safety issues while she was sedated and reliant on mechanical ventilation via a throat tube. Purely practical stuff, but its why shes already on the hospital dental teams books.\n\nMy daughters main doctor is a haematologist/oncologist (HLH isnt technically cancer but its grouped with cancer for treatment/research/charity purposes and the drugs initially used to treat it are also used for some forms of childhood leukaemia) but shes also seen a consultant immunologist and professor in immunogentics. Shes had blood tests for [exome sequencing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exome_sequencing) and no obvious genetic reason has yet been found for her catastrophic reaction to the usually pretty mild EBV. Some results are still outstanding due to covid dominating the specialist laboratory provision - shes no longer a priority patient due to having achieved remission at the end of 2019.\n\nThroughout covid my daughter has been considered extremely clinically vulnerable and has been kept in isolation. She hasnt seen a dentist since spring 2020 - (shes now had covid, sailed through it and is keen to join the real world).\n\nWe had a phone call triage with a registrar from the hospital dental team a few days ago and have been called in for a face to face with a department consultant.\n\nMy questions for you, dentists of Reddit (or at least the few of you who have had time to read this!)are:\n\n1.When/how do supernumerary teeth form? \nMy daughter has had a head CT scan and two MRI scans, plus a dental x Ray and nothing has been brought to my attention (whereas I knew to expect my son to eventually need braces via dental x rays from when he was around 4/5 years of age) is it possible that supernumerary teeth are formed spontaneously at a much later date than primary/secondary teeth?\n\n2. Could this be related to the drugs used to put her HLH in remission? She had massive doses of corticosteroid drug Dexamethasone plus cytotoxic chemotherapy drug Etoposide and calcineurin inhibitor, Cyclosporine (most often used for organ transplant patients). I know cyclosporine can cause overgrowth of gums but this was not a side effect my daughter experienced (she did, however, develop excessive facial and body hair growth, aka hirsutism, and developed Cushings syndrome as a side of the steroid)\n\n3. Is it possible that there is an underlying condition that connects both the hyperdontia and the HLH? I have read that Ehlers Danlos patients can have one or other and my daughter is ridiculously bendy (hypermobile?) but having been assessed by a respected immunologist and having had some genetic testing I wouldve expected potential connective tissue disorders to to have come up by now?\n\n4. How likely is it that its just poor luck to have loads of extra teeth and a life threatening rare illness and there are no connections between them?\n\n5. If my daughter turned up in your practice what further tests or diagnostic imaging would you commission? \nWhat is your standard approach to supernumerary teeth and would you proceed as normal with a child with a complicated medical history? \n\nAnything else I should be thinking about?\n\n\nApart from the teeth and ongoing PTSD type symptoms my daughter is doing brilliantly, has never relapsed and still sees her haematologist for 6 monthly check ups. \nWere beyond grateful to our entire hospital team from cleaners to consultants and Im sure well have ongoing excellent care from the hospital dental team. \n\n\nIm asking here simply to cast a wide net as HLH is rare and doesnt really properly belong to any medical specialism (its an orphan disease affecting white blood cells, which in turn damages red cells, hence us seeing both a haematologist and an immunologist) and if this dental issue is a rare symptom of a rare orphan, or an unusual side effect from treating that rare orphan, I might not find a HCP who has come across it in my own region!\n\nThanks for reading and in advance for any answers or pointers you have.'"

Told it\'s mild parasthesia and could just be from an injury and would likely heal over time, recommends PT and taking advil.\n\n\n\n\n\nA chiropractor I saw during all this thought she noticed Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, so i mentioned that to PT and Neurologist who basically both said ""maybe"" but no follow up on that. The PT noticed nerve tension on left side and gave me a bunch of nerve glide exercises to try and loosen that and my scalenes. (i had to cease PT because of Covid, but im trying to do these at home).\n\nI was starting to feel mildly better having a possible diagnosis, but I was still having days where I felt just incredibly shakey, uneven, anxious. Noticing a feeling of passing out when I stand, not all the time, but enough that it is worrying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost recently I noticed nerve pain in my left outer thigh, wrapping around low left buttock, and into left groin. Feels like the skin is hyper sensitive to the touch. I also later found my left shoulder itching and took this [picture showing random hives here](https://imgur.com/a/3AVLKtL).\n\nNow that the symptoms have made their way to my leg, I\'m no longer feeling good about Thoracic Outlet and starting to feel like I have some frightening systemic nerve inflammation/problem. Many days I find myself shakey, anxious, feeling like chest palpitates, cold.\n\n\nOther pertinent medical history I can think of:\n\n * I had a Thyroid panel after my TSH came back high (5.680). My T4 and T3  levels were in normal ranges however. I was treated for growth hormone deficiency as a kid for 2-3 years with HgH.\n\n * There is a history of auto-immune. I have Eosinophillic Esophagitis, my dad as Type 1 Diabetes & Celiac, my Grandma had Lupus, I have an Aunt who has MS.\n\n * My liver AST has been high 52 U/L, 48 U/L on two separate tests (I stopped drinking anything for the second test and have cut out alcohol entirely at this point). About 4 years ago I got very sick with Epstein Barr virus (mono).\n\n * I had a Lyme test come back negative, and something called ""inflammation markers?"" come back negative as well (sorry can\'t remember the details of this one).\n\n * I had an HPV shot (first of the three) on 1/29/31. The injection was left arm and definitely hit a nerve because it hurt a lot. Wondering if this could be a severe reaction to the vaccine.\n\n * I have some uneasy feelings in my left upper abdomen, like fullness, not pain. I\'ve had issues with constipation in the past and my doctor did say things sound quiet there.\n\nSorry this is so long, it helps me to write it all down and my hope is it\'ll help someone here recommend things to check/ask for.

I'd never wake up with them. Most of the time I just felt crappy but some were bad enough to need advil.\n\nAt first I thought it was because of eye strain, so I went to the optometrist, got a new prescription (slightly progressives) plus blue light filtering lenses. Headaches didn't go away. \n\nI then realized my jaw (TMJ) has been clicking and sore since I got fillings at the dentist at the end of January and so I went back to the dentist, they filed down my fillings to correct my bite, but the dentist said if I was clenching/grinding because of my bite and that was causing the headaches it would be in my sleep and I'd wake up with them, not during the day. So, he suggested it was stress related. \n\nI then did some prodding around to figure out the pressure points that were the cause of my headache and again it was my jaw (TMJ). So, I was trying to do exercises for my jaw to fix the clicking. This didn't help the headaches. \n\nI went to my family doctor, she said based on ruling these other things out (I also new they weren't caffeine withdrawal or dehydration headaches) she said they must be tension headaches caused from bad posture, sedentary lifestyle, all day looking at my phone/computer and perhaps also not eating or drinking water til noon most days. A combination of things. She prescribed massage and chiropractics (which I have not done yet but I'm planning on doing both massage and physio therapy).\n\nI then got thinking that maybe my tension isn't coming just from my jaw alone and perhaps from my neck. I deduced that my always slouched/hunched, looking down at my phone, looking down at my laptop positions were shortening/tightening my front neck muscles which was pulling my jaw. At the time of figuring this out I was starting to wake up with jaw pain. \n\nI started doing simple neck stretches (set an alarm and tried to remember to do them every two hours) and the headaches are gone. \n\nTLDR: Was getting tension headaches everyday, took a while to figure out that it was tightened neck muscles causing jaw pain and tension headaches.

Life was super easy and enjoyable. I had big goals for myself.    \nThen one day I got a viral infection. Whatever for me but it took me down pretty hard. I was pissing and coughing blood, had a 104 fever, the works. Went to a low cost clinic, they didn't know what it was and gave me Cipro then sent me on my way.  I eventually recovered but had lasting affects that I brushed off.        \nUntil I ended up in the ER from going unconscious and convulsing. They accused me of drug seeking even though I had a clean UA and never even wanted drugs? I just wanted answers. They dismissed me with a whopping bill.     \n\nI stopped going out in public as I feared I'd be forced back into the ER again.   \n\nI tried to get setup with a general dr and was told to drink more water with a shrug.    \n\nMy attacks got worse. They consumed my life and I was starting to get panic attacks at every twinge of bodily discomfort.     \n\nI was put on Lexapro and it caused my body to go into full paralysis and I felt a fear I've never experienced in my life. I couldn't move, breathe, scream, I couldn't feel anything but terror. Once again, drs brushed this off and got mad at me for wanting to stop the meds.    \n\nI went to a therapist and she told me my emotions are flat and dull and to practice how to respond to things by watching sad or funny movies. This only made me feel like a sociopath.     \n\nShe told me she thinks we won't make much progress unless I get back on meds and referred me to a psychiatrist that never even had the time of day to fit me in.     \n\nAnd my health is still deteriorating. I feel so sick everyday. Muscle chills, fevers, cold sweats, fainting, migraines, diarrhea, vomiting, loud ringing in my ears, vision is vibrating, day long severe vertigo attacks.    \n\nI've seen countless specialists and doctors. I have so many diagnoses. I'm a hopeless case and doctors really just want to yeet me back to mental health so I've given up.      \n\nI was able to find others like me with similar stories, similar diagnoses. They seem to be in the same boat.  Some finally figure it out but most are lost.     \n\nAnd now I have an extreme fear of medical professionals. The fact they will push meds on you but won't help you if you react to them scares the shit out of me."""

Ive even had it happen when I doze off on the couch for just a minute. I can sometimes feel it beginning - I feel spasms inside my head and behind my eyes when it is starting, because Im not asleep yet. There might be exploding head syndrome along with it but Im not sure if thats just part of the paralysis episodes or if its a separate thing. The only pattern I can find is that it happens most often when Im very tired, and it usually starts when I become lucid and realize that Im dreaming. I have woken up screaming a few times from the fear, and once I stayed up crying for the rest of the night because I was afraid to go back to sleep. I wasnt even sure that I was awake and repeatedly begged my partner to convince me that I was actually awake, because that night I had woken up several times and called out for help or left the room, only for none of it to be real, it was all part of the sleep paralysis dreams.\n\nMy therapist and psychiatrist both say its just stress.

benzonatate,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical_advice/comments/11n7ajr/should_i_go_to_urgent_care/,b'Should I go to urgent care?',,"b'Last Saturday I came down with COVID. I have both moderna shots and the booster (not the updated booster) but man it\'s been rough. Around Monday evening the sore throat that feels like a sunburn gave way to a single point of intense pain on the back of my throat. I have been waking up at night sweating and with this point searing in pain after having soaked in my nasal drainage for a few hours. I take Tylenol and ibeauprofin, try hard to swallow hard or spit up all the viscous snot (thus agitating the point) and go back to sleep for a few hours before waking up with the same pain and sweating. When it\'s finally morning and I wake up I am exhausted and have lots of pain at this point. But after I sit up for a while, take more of the Tylenol and ibeauprofin, maybe gargle some saltwater, the pain mostly subsides and I can swallow again. Today however I felt light headed, so light headed I didn\'t feel stable sitting up. After trying to get my throat under control I had to lie back down. This was unexpected as for the most part my COVID symptoms went away on Tuesday. I thought maybe it could have been the Benzonatate a telehealth doctor prescribed yesterday, or a lack of calories as I have only been able to eat a bowl of soup a day since Monday as anything else hurt that part of my throat too much. Normally I would just leave it and assume I\'d get better eventually but some have told me I could have strep and as I have an international flight a week from Sunday I really REALLY don\'t want to be sick for. So in summary. Got COVID, symptoms mostly gone except for a painful nodule in the back of my throat (I have pictures), light headedness but that might be other things, and a what I think might be a fever but could just be my house having shit climate control and I can\'t verify because I don\'t have a thermometer. I have a trip I can\'t miss coming up but don\'t especially want to spend $500 to go to urgent care just to be told I have COVID and it will go away ""at some point"".

dilaudid,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/tuxzyl/help_my_dads_53m_condition_is_quickly_declining/,"b""Help - my dad's (53M) condition is quickly declining and I want to know if there is anything we could be missing (hepatic encephalopathy from liver cirrhosis + AS + delirium tremens)""",,"b"" My dad has been in the hospital for almost nine days and his condition is rapidly deteriorating. He first went to the ER after he was unable to sleep for five days straight, and complaining of a very bloated upset belly. He is an alcoholic (though was sober for six months last year, then started drinking again probably early fall) and in previous years, he abused prescription drugs like dilaudid. He also has a severe case of ankylosing spondylitis with many of the complications that often come along with the disease. So between his AS and alcoholism, on top of the fact that he doesn't eat or sleep much normally, he has not been in great health for quite some time. However, he has never really had any scares of liver failure previously. For what it's worth, he told me on the phone just before he went to the hospital that he felt like he was dying.\n\nThe doctors admitted him and began treating him for alcohol withdrawal and ran some tests and found that he had liver cirrhosis. His alcohol withdrawal was really rough and he quickly fell into a horrible case of delirium tremens, hallucinating and completely delirious (mentally he was relatively normal Thursday night when he was admitted, then on Friday he was already delirious). On top of that, the doctors think he has hepatic encephalopathy from liver cirrhosis so he has been completely out of it (mentally) for nine days. They've been treating him with lactulose for the encephalopathy and of course ativan for the withdrawal and severe agitation, and now have him on dilaudid because he has been writhing in pain for nine days straight. They're also treating him with antibiotics in case of any infection.\n\nFor the first six days, he would be awake and talking for much of the time but most of what he said wouldn't make sense; though he would vaguely respond to people at times. I wasn't able to visit him until he had been in the hospital six days, and at that point he was pretty bad and mumbling incoherently mostly but he responded to me when I asked if he knew who I was, and when I said I love you, he said I love you too. But it was hard to make out. Yesterday and today though, day nine, he is not responding to anyone at all, nor is he speaking or hardly even opening his eyes (when he does, the whites are very yellow). But he was writhing and moaning in pain despite the doctors giving him extraordinary amounts of ativan and some dilaudid too, plus he's on methadone. They've had him restrained and laying almost flat for about eight days and his lungs started accumulating liquid. On a good day, my dad experiences incredible amounts of pain from his AS and I know laying in a bed for days straight would absolutely destroy his back so I'm sure that's much of the reason he's in so much pain.\n\nThe doctors were hoping his withdrawal-induced delirium and confusion would clear up naturally within 5-7 days, but they haven't and he is only getting worse (unable to speak now and unresponsive). His stomach is extremely bloated but upon taking an ultrasound of my dad's belly, apparently there's not a ton of fluid built up but actually quite a bit of air. The doctors are stumped as to why the air build up. Since his condition is only getting worse, the doctors decided it's best to run some test to rule everything out but the only way to run these tests are to intubate him and sedate him heavily because he squirms around in pain and can't hold still otherwise. So, they have him intubated and sedated right now, and also propped up so he's not laying on his back (he looks so much more comfortable and peaceful now as opposed to the entire week before where he was just writhing in pain all day). They ran a CT scan today and will have the results tomorrow, and will also do a spinal tap and MRI. I will note that his vitals are pretty good and he did have one small fever since being there, but nothing major.\n\nBasically I'm wondering and at this point begging anyone who knows anything if there is something the doctors might be missing? If they don't find anything after running these tests, it's just going to be a matter of keeping him as comfortable as possible as he dies a slow death, completely unresponsive and basically unconscious. He is only 53. Does this all sound like simply hepatic encephalopathy, and if so, can that actually kill a person so suddenly even though they had no major warning signs before (that I know of, anyway)? If it is HE, what should we expect for the last few days of his life to look like, and how long would we expect until he were to pass away? Is it still possible that he might recover even though things have only gotten worse, if it is HE? Is there something the doctors can do that they aren't currently doing/treating him for? I'm so devastated especially since he's clearly in so much pain when he's not heavily sedated and he's not even aware of what's going on around him. It's like his entire existence this past nine days is pain, with no awareness of anything except for pain. And that fucking kills me. I just want to talk to my dad again and tell him how much he means to me and know that he's hearing it. I want to hear him say he loves me at least one more time.

Dentist is stumped, doesnt show up on x-rays'",,"b'M 22. Potentially worth noting I have a narrow pallete but only crowding on my lower jaw. Braces years ago, no retainer, my top teeth are still very straight.\n\nI describe the pain as a deep ache, it comes and goes. Sometimes its a 2/10 sometimes its a 6/10, sometimes its not there. It is not sensitive to anything specific (read what my dentist did below). Sometimes my lip tingles but its rare. It is localized in the first top left molar but sometimes travels to the ones behind it.\n\nI take both ibuprofen and acetaminophen occasionally, only the ibuprofen helps with the pain, and only very slightly (like not even worth taking a pill level of relief)\n\nSo timeline:\n\nAbout 2 years ago I started to get a bit of discomfort on my upper left side near my first and sometimes second molars. It was super occasional and extremely mild so I didnt think much of it (I know I know, bad of me).\n\nAfter about a year, it was getting more noticeable and frequent. In february (2022) I noticed my wisdom teeth were coming in (felt one poking through) and my whole jaw on that side would ache similarly to how this feels, so I assumed that was the cause of my discomfort. I saw my dentist who referred me to my oral surgeon, and at that time I mentioned my tooth. Because of money issues we could not x-ray it, and he said we would take a proper look at it when we can.\n\nI saw my oral surgeon in March. We took an x-ray, I did in fact need my wisdom teeth out. I had 1 impacted upper one in my RIGHT side, the left one (pain side) was vertical as it should be. I mentioned my painful tooth. He said he sees nothing on his x-ray, but its not the same kind as the one the dentist gives me.\n\nIn May I had my surgery (I had to wait because I had to save money). At this point my tooth was aching a lot as I described above. The surgery went very well. After the surgery, I had 4 dry sockets and a mild infection in the lower left. I went back and my surgeon did another x-ray, confirmed the infection, and gave me another round of amox which in fact cleared it up.\n\nIn June I saw my dentist again because during my surgery they knocked a filling off of my bottom left second molar. At this time I was healed but my holes were still open. I mentioned my tooth still hurts, and asked if they would look at the new x-rays my surgeon took after my surgery because I still could not afford ones from them. They called for a fax and got them within a few minutes, pulled them up, explained to me again how they were different than their regular x-rays, and then to the best of their ability confirmed they saw nothing abnormal.\n\n**At this point my tooth pain is almost constant and really hard to ignore. Its there from the moment I wake up until I go to bed, only occasionally letting up randomly through the day. It makes my bottom jaw tremble.**\n\nYesterday I saw my dentist for an oral exam and cleaning. I told him my tooth was still hurting and I think it must be a bad cavity. They did x-rays on my whole mouth and I do have some very small cavities that shouldnt be hurting mebut not in these teeth. He showed me my x-rays and explained what he looks for and how these teeth are perfectly healthy. He did some tests on these teeth, knocking them with tools, scratching, cold air, cold water, a weird icy gel. Nothing increased the pain. He asked me about sweet foods and I said no increase of pain. He poked at my closed wisdom holes and pressed all around my pallete and gums and even around my uvula. He asked me if I had sinus issues and I said no so he had me stand up and touch my toes to see if the pressure makes it hurt more but it made no difference. He said my gum seemed very healthy too. Ive never seen bewilderment in a medical professionals eyes so I started to get worried. He told me he has no idea why it hurts, it shouldnt hurt.\n\nHes told me to talk to my family doctor about checking my sinuses, which I am going to do, but I dont think its my sinus. Its a deep ache within the tooth and gum area, on the outside more than the inside.\n\nJust wondering if anyone has any other ideas on what it could be, as it didnt show up on either x-ray. Im really suffering here! Ouch!!!'"

And I\'m talking some of my favorite foods, pizza, tacos. About a month ago I pretty much stopped being able to eat. I\'d look at food and my stomach would immediately churn and I would feel like I was gonna vomit immediately. Last week I spent over $150 on doordash in a single day ordering meals from every single one of my favorite food places, and I couldn\'t get past more than a single bite. So it\'s not for lack of trying. I\'ve dumped so much money into trying to cook anything that I would find appetizing. When I walked through the grocery store I felt nauseated even looking st the food. Not even candy which is my downfall. I\'ve been surviving by having a baguette plate where I just cut up like 10 slices of French bread and leave them on a plate and munch on them throughout the day to keep myself upright. This morning I weighed myself and I\'m down to 146 lbs. So far I\'ve waited to seek medical help because I thought it was potentially a depressive episode, but I suppose now it\'s going to turn into a bit of a rush job because the part where I\'ve started fainting spells is here. I know this isn\'t good but part of me is turning my nose up at the possibility that I\'m going to get committed into the hospital for an eating disorder or something of the sort. I live alone, I\'ve got two dogs and I\'m paycheck to paycheck. I cannot afford to pay someone to watch my dogs and I cannot afford to lose my job. \n\nSo to recap, I\'m extremely hungry. I feel ravenous like I could eat 6 pizzas in one foul swoop. The moment I even smell pizza or get it close to my mouth I wanna throw up. If I eat, I throw up. No pain in my abdomen. No other random symptoms. Tested negative for covid. No fever. 172lbs > 146 lbs. Fainting spells starting today. \n\nHas anyone gone through something similar? Did anything in particular work for you to get over it? If I seek medical treatment, am I going to get committed over something like this (have to seek out something to do with my dogs, maybe call a favor from out of state family.) Any advice is appreciated, idk what I\'m doing.'"

It discusses with some people researching westernized pattern stress disorder by looking at macack monkeys in africa, cause as Robert Sapolsky puts it, the pressure that workers are placed under matches that of these monkeys who forage for food for four hours in the morning and use the rest of the day treating each other like crap.. The stress in the west is like how people at the bottom are expected to work 80 hour weeks to live and how graduates are pressured to pay off impossible student loans, etc..  \n\nIn the documentary it reveals why stress causes ulcers and one lady claims that it could be what is clogging your arteries. \n\nWhich of these cause lesions in the arteries: high blood sugar, adrenalin.. \n\nWhy is the cholesterol in the arteries? Would it be to cover the lesions to prevent a rupture? I know cholesterol is used in the brain to insulate the wiring between the neurons, this is why children epilepsy have epilepsy is a reduction of cholesterol in the brain, and why patients taking crestor are forgetful (which should be taken before bed cause thats when the brain generates the most cholesterol). So cholesterol has a purpose. Wouldn't it use cholestrol than platelets, as the blood flow is too great for a cut to heal, as this is the bodies blood cell superhighway. \n\nIf it is the case, then what causes clogging of the arteries is things like stress, blood sugar and adrenalin, and cholesterol is the bodies short term solution, that results long term in clogging?  Also according to Sapolsky, what stress does is suppress the immune system (ulcers form when immune fails to deal with bacteria that causes them) cognitive function (cramming for final tests in college , leave you blank the day of the test and slow ---- road rage in traffic jams , man kills another with shotgun have - you heard that rumor), tissue regrowth and suppreses reproduction (olympic gymnast unable to bare children during preparation). And the incapacity to deal with the stress feeds back into the problem. \n\nAlso what was the theory as to why the covid virus was unleashed? Stressed animals soldby stressed handlers, inside markets surrounded by beasts from distant habitats. I wondered during covid why Robert Sapolsky wasn't being interviewed."""

NSAID eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/lia9sj/pregnancy_and_sciatic_pain_from_a_disc/,b'Pregnancy and sciatic pain (from a disc)',,"b""Hey!  \n\n\nI've stalked this sub for a couple of weeks now, and it's very interesting to read everyone's stories, so I thought I'd ask for advice as well. I apologize in advance for the long-winded story, but I feel like if anyone understands and sympathises, it's people from this community.\n\nFirst and foremost, I'm currently pregnant - 27 weeks, but pregnancy did not cause my sciatic pain - I wish. Back in March 2020 I deadlifted too heavy and hurt my lower back (was in a lot of pain for about 2 weeks - but only in lower back). It fixed itself somewhat; meaning I was able to continue working out, but some positions caused a bit of right leg pain. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn December (when I was already about 20 weeks pregnant) I decided to do some Pilates, and after that, the pain started to travel down my right leg - sitting was uncomfortable, and standing up after sitting caused some shooting pains. Nothing too bad, and walking made it better. However, the pain started to get worse and worse, despite me still being active. I started getting some pain in the middle of the night when I would wake up to use the bathroom - going back to bed after that was uncomfortable - I had a hard time finding a position where it wouldn't hurt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to finally being able to see a neurologist in January, who pretty quickly said (after doing the straight leg test and a quick examination) it was L5 radiculopathy (aka sciatica), and suggested that I might try water aerobics, and I probably wouldn't get any relief from PT. She also suggested that I already stay home from work and just try to take it easy. I followed her instructions - I'm currently on my sick leave and won't have to go back to work for a long time (perks of living in Europe). Around January 18th, I also decided to go try water aerobics. Now this is where it got *real.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring the aerobics I felt fine, but the day after - oh boy... I have never felt pain like that in my entire life. It hurts *constantly*. Walking is painful (or any kind of pressure on my leg), laying down is painful (I only have one very specific position where I'm somewhat pain-free), turning around while laying down is the worst, coughing/sneezing is horrible, turning my body is painful - in short, *everything* hurts, and it's so bad in the morning. I wake up and start my day with tears in my eyes, because it's so bad. The neurologist did prescribe 150mg of Diclac (a NSAID), and it's the only thing that will calm down the pain for about 24 hours. But since I'm pregnant, I can only take it until about 33 weeks (an internal md's advice), and definitely not every day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe internal doc also sent me to get an x-ray (the queues for MRIs are long, and the exposure from an x-ray is safer for the baby as well) to see if anything is so bad that it required emergency surgery. They could see that there is significant narrowing between the L5-S1 vertebrae, but nothing that would warrant surgery while pregnant. I also have been seeing a PT and we've been trying to do light stretching and exercises in a warm pool, but doing them in the water hurts as well. No amount of stretching or moving (I've tried a bunch from youtube PTs) has actually helped with the pain, it just hurts to do them, and it doesn't feel good at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here I am - 27 weeks pregnant (13 weeks!! to go), in horrible pain every day. And I know it's going to get worse as the baby continues to grow and push on my spine as well. Any advice on how to handle the pain? After having the baby, should I push for immediate surgery? I cannot even imagine how it would be like to take care of the baby while being in such tremendous pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone (pregnant or not!) has any advice for me, I'd greatly appreciate it."""

anticonvulsant vomit,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/11jp6lz/dismissed_by_psych_helpadvice/,b'Dismissed by psych Help/Advice?',,"b'This is probably going to be a longer post. I was diagnosed with bipolar in October, when I was seeking out a psychiatrist to put me back on meds for anxiety/depression as I had been diagnosed with those over two years ago by my pediatrician shortly before turning 18 hence why I couldnt contact my ped to put me back on those meds as I aged out of her care and didnt have/still dont have a primary physician. During my intake and explaining numerous things concerning my current and recent moods/mood history/diagnosis history/medication history, I was diagnosed as Bipolar 2 with anxiety and ADHD. I didnt want to believe it at first, however it is absolutely correct, especially after talking extensively with my dad where we both recognized the same kinds of patterns in mood history as him. I start treatment with trileptal and Zoloft which are working relatively solidly at managing the symptoms most effecting my quality of life (uncontrollable rage and just the intensity of the mood swings). I started retaking my hormonal birth control pill (was having unprotected sex, meds kinda helped me realize I should be at least taking some precaution to prevent pregnancy as I live in a red state) which is prescribed through the pill club to me, and requires you to update your medications. When I updated, I included the trileptal, which ultimately caused my account to be suspended due to the interaction between hormonal birth control and anticonvulsants. I brought this to my psych asking to switch my medication because I didnt want to endure a procedure such as the IUD (dont have the additional time or resources to afford this, plus pain). He put me on depakote, because he agreed there was an interaction between the trileptal and found none with depakote, which almost immediately caused hours of vomiting and general increase of suicidal thoughts. I called the office and they instructed me to stop taking said medication and to come in for a sooner appointment. When I went in, my psych (who is older than dirt and male), firstly, didnt even know I was off that medication, and secondly, thought I was on a different medication altogether. He then told me that I didnt have any other options than to abstain from sex if I wasnt gonna take care of my birth control situation. When i tried to ask about alternative treatments for bipolar, such as lithium, which he had mentioned was a treatment, he said he refused to prescribe me anything other than anticonvulsants because he didnt want to deal with any side effects I might bother him about. I began to raise my voice because I was at a loss at what to do, and he told me that I was too difficult to treat, the office manager came in as he could hear the back and forth (very tiny office, psychs office connects to office managers with a door). The office manager told me I had to leave if I was going to argue with the doctor, I asked my psych what else could be done and he said nothing and that I needed to leave since I refused to follow his treatment plan. So I left the office with no medication to treat my bipolar (no mood stabilizer or antidepressant) and was told I was being dismissed as a client. Additionally, I left a google review urging others to not receive care from here and explained my interaction with him that day, he replied to my review which is attached to my name and explained the interaction as he saw it. This confirmed the fact that I received treatment from him and specifically mentions that I refused to stop taking my birth control, as well as calling me vulgar, which I took pretty hard as I felt I was trying very hard to not let anything offensive/cursing come out so he couldnt just write me off as being crazy. I now have no access to any medication, which is immensely difficult for anyone plagued with this disorder, but has been especially hard as a completely financially independent college student with all my schooling funded by academic scholarships requiring me to be stable enough to merely survive but also maintain an above average GPA with no psychiatric accommodations as he cancelled the forms being faxed over to my colleges office of disability to get accommodations. I guess Im looking for both support and guidance about this entire situation. Was I genuinely rightfully dismissed? Is there anything I can do about the reply to the review I left other than taking it down? I just dont want others to make the same mistake of seeking treatment from someone who lacks basic empathy and understanding of bipolar patients.'"

This isn\'t the first time a Dr has tried to give me SSRI\'s for this. I, however, react really badly to them. They make me feel out of control and manic like. They also make my anxiety way worse so I haven\'t taken it but a few times. I told my physician and she gave me a mood stabilizer to go with it. It didn\'t help so again I stopped taking them both. She set up an appointment for me to go see a psychiatrist because she believes im bipolar because of how the SSRI\'s make me feel. Now for the drug abuse part..\n\nEver since high school I have been interested in different drugs. During my senior year I started to take Benadryl and cough syrup (not together) since they were easy to get down at the store. I started smoking cannabis after I graduated. I honestly still smoke it and also smoke CBD hemp to help manage my anxiety, insomnia, and lack of appetite. But going back to after high school..\n\nI experimented with shrooms and other psychedelics and they were cool but made me in a bad place afterwards so I didn\'t really do them much. I tried Xanax, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and Dilaudid and never got addicted to them, just took them every now and then. Well one day I got sent to the hospital because one of my friends was worried about me killing myself. I use to freak out on people when they didn\'t wanna spend time with me because I felt they didn\'t like me or something. Im not sure. From middle school until about 3 years after high school I would do this. I felt like no one wanted to be around me so I would make sure they didn\'t I guess? Im not sure. \n\nBut anyways, when that happened, the cops found some weed and I got charged with it and was on probation for a bit so I couldn\'t smoke. I started smoking k2 (spice) in place. At first it was nice. It felt just like weed and I enjoyed it. Eventually it took over my life. I lost my job and ended up staying at home all day doing nothing but smoking k2. \n\nEventually I stopped smoking it and the withdrawals were the worst thing I\'ve ever felt in my life. It messed with me physically and emotionally and mentally. I feel like it\'s one of the main causes for any mental illnesses or other problems I now have. \n\nBut after getting off k2 and being able to smoke weed again I was back to somewhat normal me. I still had no job and honestly wasn\'t looking for one even though I needed to support myself. \n\nOne day one of my ""friends"" asked if I wanted to try meth. I had tried cocaine a couple times and it wasn\'t anything special to me. I was more into downers. But I smoked some out of a pipe and it made me feel.. normal? It completely destroyed my social and general anxiety and gave me ambition to get up and find a job and do something with my life. \n\nI found a job, stopped smoking meth to pass a drug test and started again. Life was great (other than what I was spending on meth). Eventually the price got to be too much and I stopped using it. Since then I have only smoked weed and CBD hemp. No other drugs (other than Kratom and kava). \n\nMy question is though, if I tell my psychiatrist all this, will she still be apt to give me a benzo for my panic attacks? They get really bad to the point I almost pass out. I pace back and forth and feel like screaming. The pain in my stomach and chest is horrendous. I don\'t know what else to do except try to get something to help. \n\nI know this was really long so thank you for reading through.'"
amoxicillin,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/12dhapx,b'Skin Condition - doctors tbink folliculitis',"Image801.jpg, Image802.jpg, Image803.jpg","b'I have been experiencing strange condition since January. It started when I woke up with a cluster of 3 small red bumps on my hand that my immediate assumption were bug bites. After they disnt resolve for a few weeks, i realized they were not bumps. The condition usually first appears in the morning on my hands, fingers or arms. I will wake up with a flat red area. By day 2, the redness and surface area will fade and ill be left with a tiny raised red bump. Doeant really itch, maybe from tkme to time. The bumps take about 3 to 4 weeks to totally flatten, but always seem to leave some type of mark/scar. About a month ago a doctor described it as an inflammation under my skin, and folliculitis.  He gave me an anti bacterial soap (triclosan 1%) and cream (prednisolone/gentamicin sulphate). This appeared to improve the condition for a few weeks, with a few recurring bumps. Then, it came back again with new bumps every few days and tne existing bumps never really going away. Now I am being put on a 7 day course of amoxicillin and continuing the soap and cream. They ran rheumatologicsl blood tests and I am okay. I do have eczema on my lower legs and my mom and sister both suffer from a variety of skin issues, psoriasis and my mom has rheumatoid arthritis. I also have itch all over my body for about a year but my doctor thinks its anxiety and psychological.  Hoping someone knows what this may be (or can confirm it does look like folliculitis so i can trust my doctors lol) \n\nPosting some pics of before and after    like my wrist, ypull see day one its a large flat red area and day 2 becomes small red bumps. \n\n\n Thanks!'"
Advil problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/13wbzdy/alignment_sciatica_si_joint/,"b'Alignment, sciatica, SI Joint'",,"b'Hi everyone,\n\nSorry for the long post in advance. I was hoping to give a quick history of my symptoms for the past six months and hear some of your feedback and/or questions. \n\nIve been dealing with sciatica for the past 6 months, possibly caused by lifting a heavy desk.\n\nThe first month I didnt really know what was happening and hoped it would pass. \n\nIt got worse so I went to my doctor after a few months and he said likely lower back mechanical issues, said he thought it was not disc issue, and sent me to physio.\n\nPhysio said he thought it was a disc issue and set me up with core strength, side plank, bird dog type exercises. I did them religiously and he increased their difficulty for 2 months but things were getting slowly worse week by week.\n\nI did tell my physio 2-3 months back that its weird my left leg feels longer than my right but he didnt think much of it. \n\nThere have been days where the pain is less, but generally I feel pain in down my left side only. In my buttocks 24/7, up into my lower back I feel it most of the time, and then down my hamstring, back of my calf, sometimes around the front of my lower ankle as well, both heels get numbness (probably more of a pins and needles feeling since Im not physically losing sensation) and my toes as well, mostly left big toe but sometimes the other 4 on that foot too.\n\nI was not seeing progress with physio and did read back mechanic a few times and my pain is mostly all flexion related.\n\nGetting my left shoe on is very painful and challenging. \n\nI did the big 3 in addition to my physio for a few days but I actually seem to be getting worse and really stopped all my exercises at that point because I was feeling near constant pain since then. Ive been just resting and icing and light walking for probably 45 days now with zero progress. \n\nSince it was not getting better I went back to doctor for imaging request plus new issue I noticed, alignment is bad in my back. \n\n[Two images of my poor alignment.](https://imgur.com/a/NoKSuNu)\n\nMy doctor felt my SI joint from behind (didnt even need to look at me with shirt off like these pictures) and told me he is certain it is a problem with my SI joint.\n\nWhats interesting is now that he has told me this the pain that I was certain was in my piriformis area really does seem to be directly on that SI joint.\n\n **next steps**\nMy doctor said he is very confident. Its not a disc issue now and also that a CT scan or MRI would had no value. \n\nHe suggested seeing a chiropractor. Personally, Im not a fan of chiropractors and Ive never been to one due to some bias instilled in me throughout my life. I told him as much and he suggested he almost never suggests chiropractor either except with SI joint issues.\n\nIm still waiting for the hospital to get back to me about scheduling a CT scan but I do have a MRI scheduled for next week, so Im hoping that provides some information one way or another. \n\nThe pain is pretty bad most mornings, mellows out during the day, and by evening its bad again. My doctor has offered medication, but so far Im only taking Advil, ibuprofen, and more recently some muscle relaxers in the form of Robax usually in the evening an hour or so before bed.\n\nWhat do you guys think about these images, the diagnosis thus far, thoughts on medication or not, injection for both pain relief or SI diagnosis (my doctor is always 100% sure hes right just by looking, but Id prefer a confirmed diagnosis and saw a surgeon speaking on YouTube about the injection method) and what would your next steps be?\n\nThank you!!'"
amitriptyline,https://www.reddit.com/r/DermatologyQuestions/comments/13g13zn/itchy_scalp_pregabalin_remedy_my_experience/,b'Itchy scalp - pregabalin remedy - my experience',,"b"" Hi,\n\nI'm a guy in my early 30's.\n\nI've spent many hours scouring reddit for a remedy for my itchy scalp issue that started about 18 months ago so I think I should share what has alleviated (at least 90%) of the problem so I might be able to help someone experiencing the same thing.\n\nTo preface my experience I should say Ive always been prone to allergies such as hay fever (badly some years), itchy mouth from certain foods and rashes from certain detergents. I had eczema as a child and generally suffer from dry skin.\n\nHowever, I never noticed any ongoing issue with my scalp itching other than maybe a bit of dandruff, which I treated with your standard head and shoulders and then the problem was gone. \n\nBut around 18 months ago my scalp starting itching and became worse and worse. No matter what anti dandruff shampoo I used i.e head and shoulders, the t-gel or nizoral it wouldn't make any difference. The itch would start and stop randomly and move from area to area on my head but predominantly on the top - it was at times unbearable. I stopped eating certain foods, took antihistamines and tried new clothing detergents but nothing helped. I started to notice hair loss and the itchiness was really starting to affect me mentally as I couldn't sleep and I couldn't concentrate on anything. The only thing that alleviated the symptoms was alcohol and this was clearly not a good solution.\n\nI went to an urgent treatment centre one night when I was going crazy. The doctor who couldn't see anything much in the way of a rash prescribed fexofenadine hydrochloride and nizoral shampoo and maybe a steroid shampoo (I forget). This didn't help so I booked an appointment with a private dermatologist as I was getting desperate and didnt want to wait for the time to be referred via an NHS appointment. Again, they said they couldn't see anything much wrong with my scalp other than maybe some pustules, so they prescribed me a long course (maybe 3 months) of antibiotics, a steroid shampoo and an antihistamine. But this didnt help. When I went back to the doctor after 3 months they said that it looked like the pustules had cleared up and there was no sign of rash but the itch persisted so they sent me to another dermatologist who specialised in hair.\n\nI explained the itch and hair loss and they prescribed finasteride 1mg, 2.5mg minoxidil and another steroid shampoo/cream. The basis of this was to stop the hair loss and they thought potentially the itch could be caused by male pattern baldness. 3 months later and still no improvement so I was also prescribed isotretinoin as the doctor noticed some spots on my head. At the next appointment the doctor noted that the spots were gone but the itch was the same for me. So in addition I was prescribed 3mg of naltrexone, which is a tiny dose of a drug used to treat alcoholics but had shown some success in treating pruritus. The doctor mentioned if this didnt work then the next stage would be to try [amitriptyline](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/amitriptyline-for-depression/) or pregabalin.\n\nAfter 6 weeks of no relief I did some research on pregabalin and read a few papers on its effectiveness on relieving pruritus. I then took the decision to trial pregabalin and ordered it online from abroad. I know this goes against best safe practice but the private doctors appointments were getting expensive and I was desperate. \n\nI trialled 300mg pregabalin on myself and noticed the difference within hours. From then I took 300mg once a day before bed as it tended to make me drowsy. For the past 4 months or so Ive taken between 300 to 600mg a day and have found this prevents 90% of the itchiness and its something I think about rarely. I still also take the 2.5mg minoxidil and 1mg finasteride daily so Im on quite the cocktail. \n\nI think my hair has grown back thicker in the areas I was losing it, but hard to be 100% sure. The most important thing to me is relief from the itching. I have since visited my doctor and he has requested for my GP to prescribe me the 300 to 600mg of pregabalin that I have been taking.\n\nI should of course say that trialling pregabalin on yourself isnt advisable but if antibiotics, antihistamines, steroid creams and diet changes arent helping then maybe request it from your GP."""

This discomfort has led to multiple coping strategies that have created **muscular ache around the temporomandibular joint** **(particularly on the left).** I was referred to an **endodontist that prescribed Cracked Tooth Syndrome** as a potential prognosis, but there was no crack visible on the tooth, and they stated that the issue could be multifaceted. I am **awaiting an orofacial pain specialist opinion.** A week ago, I **had a root canal,** and this has **not resolved the problem.** \n\nI have spent hours researching my issue for months, but have found nothing that accounts for my situation. There have been no signs of decay (which all root canal articles point to), and there is no case for dentin hypersensitivity now that the nerve is gone. I am at a loss, and I hoping that someone has seen something like this.\n\n>**TIMELINE:** Back in February this year, I  had a routine fissure sealant appointment to cover up exposed dentin. Despite telling my dentist that I was highly ""occusally aware"" (term learned later) and that **there was too much sealant over the lower left first molar for my bite to be comfortable,** he dismissed it and said that I would get used to it.  \n>  \n>**The sealant was reduced two weeks later** after complaining that I was getting pain when biting downm however, it remained just a little too much (probably 1/2mm too much) over one particular spot that continued to hurt. Two weeks later, **the sealant was one again adjusted,** but the **pain remained.** Two weeks later (begin on April), that tooth got a filling at the site of the pain. However, the **filling solved nothing.** A month later (May), I was referred to an endodontist who prescribed multi-factorial Cracked Tooth Syndrome as a potential culprit, potentially due to a crack in the dentin.  \n>  \n>After trying to install an orthodontic band (in June) made the situation worse (i.e. it made my bite horrifically misaligned), it was removed in the same appointment after an observation period. Two weeks later, **the tooth was reduced and crowned with a temporary crown**. This resolved the temperature sensitivity, understandably, but **the pain on biting down still remained,** as does the passive discomfort.  \n>  \n>**I pushed for a root canal** (something I initially asked for in May) after the dentist suggested that we wait potentially a month or more for an orofacial pain opinion via the NHS, which I am still waiting for. My major concerns with waiting for another opinion came down to the fact that if this suffering could be ended with a root canal, I didn\'t want to wait 1-2 more months to do it. Unfortunately, almost a week post-procedure, the same symptoms I have experienced remained, and I am feeling at the end of my rope.\n\n**The lingering discomfort dominates my focus, and it makes doing my work incredibly difficult.** Medications like **paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen)** have been ineffective in reducing the pain or the discomfort. I have begun to **wonder to what extent it is a nerve-related issue,** but I do not know where to start, and my searches have led me nowhere. \n\nIf anyone has observed a case like mine before, perhaps you would have a key bit of information that could lead to the resolution of this life-controlling pain.

Also mentioned in that post that my hr sometimes dips into the 50s during the day.  Didn\'t happen again, didn\'t get a response here so sort of figured it was no biggie, just a random thing. \n\nAbout 10 days ago, talked later with PsyD and decided that part of my depression may be due to not getting shit done, which is likely not helped by the fact that we stopped adderall months ago so maybe we should try bringing it back, keeping an eye on blood pressure and heart rate, etc -- we had stopped because I had a bit of high blood pressure for awhile, but that was actually due to being on Florinef for my LOW blood pressure and now that I\'m really fat I don\'t need the salt retention med so the cardiologist stopped Florinef, blood pressure is back to my normal 95/75-ish even with Adderall. Cool.\n\nSince then I\'ve been really watching my heart rate with the Adderall back on board. Early mornings before I take it hr seems to average 75ish. Two hours after the Adderall, it\'s higher averaging 85ish. The weird shit: nearly any day I can have a resting hr that briefly hits 90s, but in the same day, will drop into the 50s, even in the 4 hours after I take Adderall when I\'d expect it to be higher. Generally neither the extra high or extra low last more than 30 minutes. But the lows are coming more frequently now.  Instead of once a day for 15ish minutes, or a couple blips, for about a week now I\'m noticing that it\'s going down for 45minutes or more, 3 or more times a day. Last night we were watching Kill Bill (so not a chill, meditative movie) and talking, laughing...but I\'m looking at my watch data this morning, and all through the movie my hr was in the 50s.

anticonvulsant problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/wiek1g/possible_rupture_of_tendon_or_ligament_in_jaw/,b'Possible rupture of tendon or ligament in jaw',,"b'Hi,\n\nThis will be a bit long and complicated story but I appreciate anyone who is willing to bear with me and maybe even give some input. So, here it goes:\n\nIn May I had a root canal procedure done on my left second premolar. On June 1st, I had an impacted left lower wisdom tooth removed. It was a complicated procedure. Since I also had to remove my upper left wisdom tooth, I wanted it to be done on the same day, but the surgeon for some reason did not want to, and scheduled the procedure for the 8th of June. On that day, I did not feel that the jaw was healed enough for another surgery and asked the oral surgeon for his opinion and he wanted to proceed with it. I agreed because: 1. I trusted he know what he is doing and 2. wanted to be done with it as soon as possible because I have to start treatment for MS as soon as I recover from wisdom teeth surgery. During surgery, at one point I heard the surgeon say to the assistant that he damaged something a tiny bit. I did not ask what after surgery.\n\nBecause I was eating smoothies and yogurt for a week already, after the second surgery I was starving, on the second day, I started eating normally because it seemed like I can. However, it was all good until I bit a hard piece and my jaw slipped to the side and I heard a very loud pop. It did not hurt. My jaw felt a bit loose. I could continue to eat but I had to be careful how I move my jaw because it was a bit loose. When I looked at the mirror, my jaw also looked a bit loose while I was opening and closing it. I have had TMJ problems for years, after Another wisdom teeth surgery in 2016, so I was used to jaw popping and deviating while opening. Although this seemed strange, I did not think much of it since there was no immediate pain. The pain started in the days that followed, but I attributed it to surgery. It only came when I bit into something and chewed. I went for control and to remove stitches, mentioned pain but not that popping incident, and since the wound looked okay they thought everything is okay. Pain when chewing worsened and I also developed eye pain, especially with eye movement. I went to the surgeon, and told him about the pain, he did x ray, and everything looked fine.\n\nThe day after that, I woke up and was almost blind in my left eye. Went to the emergency, got diagnosed with optic neuritis. No one wanted to talk about surgeries I had, because I have MS so it was a clear case of ON for them. After that, I went through hell. The pain worsened so much, I was in and out of ER without any answers. My jaw hurt, I had shooting pains from jaw up to top of my head, temples, tension headache in the back of my head and my neck. My left cheek felt tender and painful to touch, but it was not swollen and I could open my jaw. I went to the Faculty of dentistry where I got the procedure done every week or even a couple of times a week. Always without answers. My neurologist put me on anticonvulsants because he thought I had trigeminal neuralgia. Nobody wanted to talk about the connection between ON and surgeries. And when I asked if maybe I fucked up something with hard foods too early, they said no and brushed it off. I even went to maxillofacial surgery, and they said it is TMJ disorder without a thorough exam and sent me on my merry way.\n\nI still continued going to oral surgery, and they decided to do the revision of the upper wisdom tooth extraction site. After revision, I was in horrible pain, but the pain soon subsided because I was eating only smoothing and icing that area. However, whenever I tried to start eating anything I had to chew however soft it was, the pain would return. And if I continued doing that, pain in the eye would start. I also developed ear pain. After I went back on a smoothie diet, iced my jaw, and rested it as much as possible, the pain subsided. If I try to use my jaw, it returns.\n\nLast week, I did so much research because I was feeling that doctors were missing something. First, I stumbled upon temporal tendonitis, and it perfectly matched my pain patterns. I feel pain in the upper and lower molars, pain in the temple, back of the head, eye pain, and ear pain. Pain is aggravated when chewing. Then I remembered that loud pop and jaw looseness and now I feel pretty sure that I had some tendon or ligament rupture, that I continued to re-injury and that became very inflamed which triggered ON in my left eye. Tomorrow I will go again to the maxillofacial surgery department and hopefully, now I will get some proper answers and help.\n\nI am scared that because 2 months went by since the injury, permanent damage is done. And I am scared that it was a complete rupture and now it healed improperly. Does anyone have any experience with jaw tendons and ligaments? Does loud pop always indicate a complete tear? Can it be repaired even after 2 months? Will it be able to heal or will I be doomed to eat smoothies for the rest of my life and always live with the risk of it again triggering ON?'"

NSAID swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/13yykdy/update_sudden_attack_while_traveling_abroad/,b'Update: sudden attack while traveling abroad',,"b'See my post history for info.  I wanted to update my case since its not such a dire one and is resolving relatively quickly. \n\nSo I got back to the US on Monday and saw my primary care doc today. She confirmed that it is sciatica (technically lumbar radiculopathy) and that its almost certainly not a spinal issue in my case, given my age (57) and history. More likely swelling from a pulled muscle in my lower back.  Either from sleeping in the weird hotel bed or washing a bunch of travel laundry in the hotel bath the previous evening. Apparently ruptured discs and other disasters are more common in the younger folks, who knew?\n\nIts already miles better, 10 days out, especially sleeping in my own bed.  I still have some achiness and a little numbness. I also pulled a muscle in the calf of my opposite leg, likely from all the limping. So that sucked. \n\nThe doctor I saw in Amsterdam gave me prescription strength NSAIDs and Valium to sleep. Ive now graduated to OTC ibuprofen and a muscle relaxant for nighttime. \n\nRiding a bike was probably the only thing I could do without pain. I still managed to hobble at least 5 miles or so a day on the vacation. \n\nAt its worst, I would put the pain at 7-8/10. Ive had a baby without epidural and would put the pain and cramping feeling right up there with advanced labor contractions. Now its at about a 2/10 and entirely manageable. \n\nIm to do some specific exercises, use ice and heat, take ibuprofen, and if it isnt resolved in a few weeks, Ill get PT.  If it worsens, then scans are in order. \n\nSo, not every case is a massive injury, and some can resolve in a couple weeks. There may be hope. Hang in there.'"

All doctor confirmed diagnosis in bold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHad healthy baby at age 20, non-eventful. Then it took 5 years to get pregnant again with multiple miscarriages. Laparoscopic laser treatment of **endometriosis**. Progesterone tablets on the 6th pregnancy (age 25) immediately allowed me to carry.  Developed **symphysis pubis diastasis** at month 5. 2.5cm pre-birth, 3.5 1 month post, PT+binders resolved issues. Otherwise, uneventful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 23, had lots of bowel issues. Seemingly random diarrhea, investigated - results ""off"", but no answer. Colonoscopy revealed minor inflammation, nothing else. Diagnosis? ""No idea, just manage it with Imodium."" Bowel issues continue today. Found mild issues with heartburn - prescribed Aciphex for 4 months. **Tooth enamel begins to deteriorate** rapidly, supernumerary tooth found about 6 months post-wisdom removal. Also found out that two of my teeth are baby teeth, there were no adult teeth behind them. (All 4 of my boys also have it, the twins are mirror, so their missing teeth are opposing.) In other words, **both hypodontia and anodontia**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 24, high WBC - 14k, 16k, 15k. Began getting **migraines**, told to begin Excedrin migraine as needed. Lethargy written off due to pregnancy issues, general malaise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 25, had aforementioned baby. Took 8 months to fully walk again. Treatment of PT + Norco 10-750 (at the time, legal acetaminophen dosage). Had and continue to have **paradoxical opiate effect**. I am not only pain free, I\'m energetic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 26, inpatient, high WBC - 26k. NO OTHER SYMPTOMS. Kept 3 days and blasted with IV antibiotics. Migraines increasing in frequency. **Shoulder muscle randomly tears**. No trauma.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 26, on depo to manage endometriosis, no other hormone meds - I get pregnant.  With identical twins. Progesterone started immediately. I also begin sleeping with ankles tied together to prevent SPD recurrence. Uneventful until week 22.  Twins have stage 3 twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (**TTTS)**. (While I realize this is likely unrelated, I want to be fully complete in all complications and meds given for it.) Went in to labor night before surgery measuring 42 weeks, had mag bag. Laser ablation, 2 liters fluid removed, babies survive surgery. Begin steroid shots as no one had ever made it full term with my condition. Carried to 37 weeks, went into labor the day of induction. Mild SPD. Uneventful labor and delivery. 5 month recovery for SPD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 27, migraines increase in intensity and duration. Norco 10-325 prescribed for breakthrough migraines. **Vit D deficiency** discovered. OTC prescribed. Moles begin sprouting like weeds across face and neck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 28, begin developing ""locking"" ankle once a month or so. Told I\'m too young to have issues, probably related to bedrest from pregnancies and my weight. Lethargy increases. Teeth begin cracking. Struggle to get to sleep. 36 hour days start. Prescribed Ambien (which continues today, same 10mg dose) and sleep study with latency finds ""**abnormality in sleep pattern but no idea why**"". Doc felt if Ambien is treating it, we could stop there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 29, endometriosis gets severe enough to require partial **hysterectomy (ovaries intact)**. **B12 deficiency** discovered later in year. OTC prescribed. **Back pain** begins. First laser ablation of nerves in lower back. Helps greatly. Norco for breakthrough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 30, diagnosed **anxiety and depression**. Buspar and Lexapro prescribed. Lethargy doesn\'t change. Bruising seems to get easier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 31, **ADHD**. Due to Norco prescription, I eschew Ritalin and go with Strattera - non-stim treatment, trying to minimize interacting effects of meds. Felt no symptoms, but PCP heard some lung funkiness and ordered a CT. Lung CT reveals **pneumonia and partially collapsed lower left lung. Levaquin** prescribed\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 32, both **B12 and Vit D more deficient**. B12 shots for 4 weeks. Vit D RX of 50k once a week for 6 weeks. I begin to hate food. Laser ablation on back again, after it gave out bending over to pick up a cake out of bottom fridge shelf. Food intake reduced to twice a day. Mild itchy, very very light red, very very tiny bumps, rash begins on back. Moles continue to increase across shoulders and back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 33, my mid-range vocals begin to disappear. Raspy, scratchy. I attribute to smoking, but it seemed odd I\'d keep soprano and tenor notes, but lose alto. Ankle begins swelling, locking more often. Another ablation on lower back. Food intake once a day, but still no weight loss. Major dental surgery, 2nd molars removed. Again ask two docs (back and PCP) about ankle, told I\'m ""too young to have major problems"". **Rash** gets treatment with Voltaren. Improves some, but it still comes back in waves today. **Migraines** get so severe that I\'m down every week, and a few times a month, lasting 2-3 days. Prescribed **Amitriptilyn**. This med has worked well for a few years, increased dose 6 months ago. Working well again. Dropped Lexapro since Amitriptilyn is another anti-depressant. Maybe 2-3 times a month I add on Excedrin. Developed **prism** in eyesight. Eyes begin to jump like I\'m being shaken if I try to focus for more than a few minutes on a close project, like knitting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAge 34, begin falling when ankle completely gives out. Ask back doc if my gait is a problem. Insists it\'s not. I demand an MRI anyway. **Osteochondritis Dissecans** found.  Osteochondral Allograft Transplantation (OATs) done using cartilage from side of talus. Denovo denied by insurance. After 4 months, I drop 40 lbs in next 4 months, while on limited walking ability due to the OATs surgery. Same eating patterns as before, once a day.  Weight loss stops. Lethargy increases. Bruising seems easier, but also sticks around longer. (Example, today, I have a bruise from hitting my leg on Christmas Eve. It\'s still purple and only now just started yellowing.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooked into surrogacy for a girl. Labs and exam reveal I\'m near menopause, I\'ve only a few follicles left. Doc notes that even with my medical history and hysterectomy, it\'s still very early to be getting these results. While I should have entered earlier in general, less than 5 years post-op hysterectomy shouldn\'t have nosedived so fast. Surrogacy ruled out as they aren\'t able to harvest eggs. Moles checked by dermatologist, two biopsied after removal from face due to location blocking peripheral vision, determined none of concern, despite increasing in size and frequency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Age 35 (currently)***, visit ENT as my right ear begins to block completely like swimmer\'s ear, while being nowhere near water. ENT does scope as well as vacuum right ear which was blocked by wax (I do not use Q-tips). Scope reveals damaged vocal chords due to **laryngopharyngeal reflux**. Never felt the heartburn feeling of reflux but clearly did damage. Given two months treatment on pantoprazole with continued OTC Prilosec for 2 more months. ENT believes ear problems are **TMJ** associated with the missing molars.\n\nOATs fix begins failing in the last month. Ankle swelling is beginning again, as well as pain. Mild, very sparse locking. Beginning pain in hips, right wrist joints. Diarrhea is pretty much ALL my bowel movements now - though the texture and... err... ""explosiveness"" vary - about once a month, I\'m wakened in the night due to it. The last few weeks, I\'ve gotten morning nausea. Happens upon waking, disappears 60-90 minutes later and I\'m fine. Last 3 days, clear mucus goes with diarrhea, usually a ""sputter"" when I\'d only intended to urinate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the last 2 months or so, I don\'t even want to drink anything. I don\'t get nauseated or gag reflex issues from intake, I just really, really don\'t want anything. Yet, I still continue to maintain at 200lbs, even with mild exercise added in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI continue to hear from various docs and PCP that I\'m ""too young"" to have any real big problems, so ""let\'s just wait and see if it resolves"".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current symptoms: diarrhea, nausea, migraines, restlessness, lethargy, joint pain, joint failure, back pain, insomnia, thin nails, jumping eyes, continued tooth degradation, vitamin deficiency, hormone deficiency, random shortness of breath, heart skips a beat once or twice a week while resting, force feeding and drinking, consistently varying - but always high - WBC, right ear pain and blocked sound.**\n\nMy FitBit tells me that my resting heart rate is also on the increase.

Advil itch,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/2ckv8p/wife_has_multiple_personalitiespersonas/,b'Wife has multiple personalities/personas?',,"b'My wife has recently revealed to me that she has two personas that she \'slips into\' when she is nervous. One is a tough Scandinavian(Maybe Icelandic? She seems kind of nordic to me, especially her name, but I\'m not sure of ""her"" ""county of origin"") woman, who wears a lot of dark and revealing clothing, and she\'s very confidant and sexually appealing. (Her words, not mine, I think my wife is always beautiful) and the other is softer woman, she is outgoing, wears bright colors and dresses, and jokingly calls herself a fairy queen, because she loves flowers or floral prints. She will go so far to wear wigs and makeup to further change her appearance. (Not completely odd, but she usually doesn\'t even wear makeup)\n\nI don\'t know if I should be worried. She doesn\'t want to talk to a therapist about it, because she is happy and it seems to help her, and I don\'t know if there is a negative effect to this.\n\nThough it worried me today when my wife told me she wanted people to refer to her as her persona\'s name when she is in that persona. These two persona\'s represent two big personality traits she **thinks** she is not, confidant and attractive.\n\nShe\'s also rarely referred to a third persona that used to ""take over for her"" when she was younger and afraid, but I\'ve never personally seen this persona, or heard her mentioned in quite some time.\n\nShe\'s has been diagnosed with PTSD because of her traumatic childhood, and I\'ve been suspecting for about 6 months that she might also be bipolar. I\'ve been reading as much as I can about it, and I\'m **not** self diagnosing, but it sound EXACTLY like her, and that worries me. She was taking a LOT of meds before she refused to see her therapist anymore and quit them all cold turkey and she hated it to the point that I have to fight her just to get her to take Advil for a headache. Her therapist didn\'t really care about her and would constantly and repeatedly tell her to do things that never worked for her, or she wouldn\'t tell her how to do them. (EX. Telling her multiple times to tap her hands when she is nervous, didn\'t work. Told her to buy anti itch cream for her She has anger problems, she bottles it up til she explodes, therapist told her to find a healthy outlet or way to express it. She asked for help on how because she honestly doesn\'t know, and she just kept saying ""Try something that works for you."" and then promptly ended the session 20 minutes early. It\'s only the first therapist we\'ve tried, but it\'s kind of put her off the idea of therapists.) Her therapist also dismissed her self harm merely because it wasn\'t cutting. My wife hits herself very hard when she does something ""wrong"" or when she is frustrated, and she\'s left bruises on her hands and arms when she bites herself for the same reason. She also obsessively scratches and picks at things. I\'ve managed to keep her from scarring her face, her chest and arms, but her shins/ankles look awful.\n\nHer life flip flopped when she moved away from her father\'s house. She didn\'t even know anything was wrong with her until she left, because even though her father is an awesome guy, he isn\'t a doctors kind of person and has a lot of stereotypical misconceptions about mental health which make my wife afraid to talk to him about her problems.. She has chronic anemia (to the point that she would be so tired she would stop where she was and lay on the floor and fall asleep. Not like narcolepsy where she would just pass out, but she would get too tired to move, purposefully lay on the floor and then sleep) and was often told she just needed a nap. Luckily her dad is a meat and potatoes kind of guy, so she was getting constant iron. But I can\'t afford that, so her only choice is iron pills, which make her sick. And most of her bad memories were repressed or she consciously ignored them and didn\'t even realize they were that bad.\n\nIt\'s frustrating as hell because I want so bad to help her. to see her run home and hug me excitedly when I come home from work like she used to when we first moved out together. But now she\'s so lonely and anxious sometimes she doesn\'t even get out of bed and just cries all day. Where we live, riding the bus isn\'t exactly convenient, and she gets extremely anxious even when in a car, so driving herself isn\'t an option now. She refuses to have roommates, because the last couple were awful. She spends the entire week home alone and she lives for the weekends, when we can leave the house together. She is terrified of leaving alone, because when she has an anxiety/panic attack, she completely shuts down, or just runs away. It\'s like fight or flight, but more like shut down or flight. \n\nShe had an anxiety attack when she was walking home in the dark about two years ago when she missed her bus home and she shut down so badly I had to leave work immediately and hunt her down in the city. Nothing happened to her, to which I am immensely relieved, but now she\'s terrified of it happening again, so she just *doesn\'t* leave the house alone, unless it\'s to check the mail.\n\nI\'m trying to get us out of the apartment we\'re in at the end of our lease, which is soon, but she\'s being stressful about that too.\n\nI\'m sorry, this turned into a kind of rant, but I guess I needed to let it out. If someone has some advice for me, please **PLEASE** message me or reply. I\'m so desperate to see my wife smile again that I would do anything. '"

I went to my therapist the next day told her what happened, and she sent me to the psych ward.\n\nIve been out of the psych ward since last Wednesday, and two days to before leaving they bumped my Effexor from 150 mg to 225.

I didnt like it at all.\n\nNow, lets get to this weekend due to my suicide attempt my friends have been coming over more often and forcing me to get out of the house. \n\nFriday night, we go out bowling and I smoke a lot of weed.

I failed to realize I had barely any food or water in my system. I did smoke a large amount of weed before going to the airport. I was doing this to ease the sickness. I was feeling. I also have a psychiatrist appointment that day, I had planned to bring all this up\n\nAs Im getting to the psychiatrist, I feel like Im going to die. I have to park about half a mile away and walk. The whole time Im drenched in sweat and having all the same side effects. Let me also add that the lack of sleep was making me start the hallucinate and be a little delusional.\n\nI get into the psychiatrist office they set me down at the computer to do the pre-screening. Thats when I start really feeling ill. I am sweating profusely in this cold building, and I am going to throw up, I look around for a trashcan, Nothing. My vision starts to blur in my motor skills. Kind of go to shit.\n\nI get up to walk to the bathroom down the hall and around the corner. I made it about 10 feet and projectile vomit all over the wall. I try to keep walking to the bathroom again projectile vomiting Probably another 10 feet down the walk. And then once more right after the second. I fall down against the wall and shout for a nurse. They called the ambulance and thats when everything was kind of a blur.\n\n As Im leaving the therapist, I ask him should I stop taking the extra 75, and he told me its up to the hospital whatever they say, the doctor in ER knows nothing about depression meds, she said she has no idea.\n\nThe hospital ran blood, urine heart brain, and the rest of the usual tests,Everything came out fine.\n\n I mentioned pain in my lower, right stomach. So they did a CAT scan and said my appendix was swollen and I could have appendicitis. They told me if I feel pain in the area or get a fever come back to the ER immediately and released me with no meds and really no information. \n\nI get home I get some food and still feel like dog shit, I manage to fall asleep around 6 PM waking up around 8 PM. I wake up, still feeling nauseous and gassy, but not as bad as I was earlier. \n\nI dont have a thermometer at home, but I did wake up hot and sweating.\n\nI took a regular dose of liquid, melatonin, and hopefully a knock out for the rest of the night and feel better in the morning because this aint cutting it!\n\nI guess my question is, am I safe to cut out the 75 mg until further notice due to only being on the dose for a short period of time?

Diverticulosis and possible IBS.\n\nGood afternoon, doctors!\n\nI have been recently struggling with an odd pain sensation in twitching throughout my body. \n\nA few months ago, I noticed a popping in my ears with significant ear pain that let me to go to an urgent care, as I thought it was just an ear infection. Unfortunately, it wasnt an ear infection but they couldnt find any evidence of anything that was wrong, so they gave me general pain medicine and told me to follow up with a primary care provider. This was accompanied by some swollen lymph nodes on the side of my neck, as well as behind my ear. \n\nI followed up with my primary care provider, and she gave me an entire blood panel, and some of my numbers were high, but she was not concerned and suggested that it could be indicative of a viral or bacterial infection that my body was fighting that I wasnt aware of, which is what was causing the lymph node issue. Eventually, the ear pain went away but she did refer me to an ENT. The ENT performed a pressure test as well as a hearing test, and just a general examination of my ears, and could not find anything that was wrong with them, and sent me to come back in six weeks. I came back after six weeks and she diagnosed me with TMJ with a prominent clicking in my left jaw (which was on the left side where the popping and pain from my ear was). The popping of my jaw is pretty loud and my jaw moves to the side when I open it wide, and the popping of the ears and pain has begun to refer to the right side as well. \n\nLiterally two days after I had that follow up with the ENT, I started getting a weird tongue root pain at the base of my tongue that made it difficult for me to talk. It felt like I was having some weird tongue strain that caused the soft palate on the roof of my mouth to hurt, as well as some general discomfort throughout my face and mouth. I return to an urgent clinic to where the doctor suggested that it could be related to my TMJ and to invest in a mouthguard and gave me some muscle relaxers (cyclobenzaprine 5-10mg a day as needed). I stopped taking the muscle relaxer when the pain from my tongue went away, as I was starting to have side effects that were not comfortable to me (head racing, anxiousness, insomnia, etc). \n\nRight after taking the medicine for the first time, I begin to notice my left ring finger and pinky finger to become intermittently numb. This is sort of a come and go thing, and eventually went away, but it came back and got so intensely store. The entire hand and arm started to feel sore, like a nerve is pinched, and it causes a burning sensation, as well as general tingling and numbness throughout my entire arm and hand. this started on the left side, and then seemingly began to move to the right all the while Im having twitching throughout my entire body, namely, my tongue, and face and legs as well. I also suffered from extreme anxiety, so I think the anxiety from the situation was causing a lot of my twitching.\n\nI visited a doctor yesterday and he took an x-ray of my head and neck region, and noticed that my spine (C5-C8) was straight instead of curved and suggested to me that this is likely the root of my issue and to fix my posture and visit a chiropractor for alignment and to do some general PT at home with a denneroll and other PT workouts. He told me to start there and if it doesnt resolve to seek other options.\n\nThe pain from my tongue comes and goes, but the discomfort on both of my arms is consistent and aggravates after doing tasks, like folding laundry, or bending down to pick something up. Its like a numbness/soreness/zapping/pins/needles/shaky feeling. Im just really concerned that theres something more sinister wrong with me, or is it truly possible that the straightness of my spine is to cause for the majority of these issues, including my TMJ, and my anxiety is just aggravating them?\n\nThanks for your advice and counsel.'"

I had a severe reaction to the IV Dilaudid they did not tell me they were giving me.',,"b'I went to the ER for a kidney infection. I described my pain as a dull ache, and asked for ibuprofen since I hadnt taken any yet that day. They agreed that the plan of action was to give me pain meds, stronger antibiotics than urgent care initially gave, IV fluids, and Zofran for nausea. They started the IV meds and I was hit with instant adrenaline shock, euphoria, throat closed as I gasped for air, feeling like I was blacking out, racing heart, and felt increasing panic with each passing second. I told the nurse, Something is wrong, something is wrong, what IS that, PLEASE stop it and finally (very delayed) she interrupted the infusion and flushed the line with saline. She told me they gave a low dose of IV Dilaudid, because thats what they usually give for flank pain. She joked with me that Im very small (103 lb 51 female). I asked for ibuprofen, not a strong narcotic. She never acknowledged that I had an obvious allergic reaction. I spent the next 3 hours calm and numb, but beside myself coping with being uncomfortably high and panicked. I asked if theyd be willing to give a single dose of an anti-anxiety med like Ativan to help with this, and they declined, because that was not the reason for the visit, and later on I can address this with a psychiatrist and therapist. I was not having a mental breakdown - my body was reacting to the medication they administered. When it came time to discharge me and send me home, I told them how awful I felt and that I was going to throw up. They sent me home crying with a vomit bag. I spent the next 5 hours vomiting at home, and the next 48 hours restless and agitated. I am so upset by this whole experience, the fact that I asked for ibuprofen and instead I was given a strong narcotic without my consent, especially because I had to drive myself home. Another reason is that I used to be a regular drug user and take oxycodone - Im 100% clean from that and would prefer to keep it that way unless I absolutely needed the treatment for severe pain. There was a camera in the ER room. Would it be appropriate and necessary to ask for this footage, if I have a right to obtain that as a patient? Is this story worth telling to someone higher up at the hospital, or do I let it go? The nurse was very kind and I dont want to get her in trouble, but I also want to advocate for myself and make sure that my reaction was properly noted - I was NOT just a lightweight like she implied - I truly believe if I hadnt instructed her to stop the medicine, I wouldve gone into anaphylactic shock or needed Narcan.'"

When deciding on whether to move forward with surgery, I read about 100 of these, and most of them were pretty scary. Thought I\'d share my positive account.\n\nTLDR: MRI to surgery in about a month - So far, everything\'s going great!\n\nI\'ve had lower back pain as long as I can remember, was treated when I was 20 for it. So this could have all started as far back as then, but for the last three years I\'ve had severe flare-ups resulting in Urgent Care visits. Sciatic pain accompanied the lower back pain, mostly in the buttocks and hips. Flare-ups would happen once or twice a year and last one to two months. I was on a three-week bicycle tour in June of last year and the back pain was at a level of severity that I had not previously known. Still had to ride 80 mile days with 8k feet of climbing every day. Chocked it up to tight hamstrings (notoriously inflexible). When I went to the docs upon arriving back in the States, he also believed it to be tight hamstrings, but something wasn\'t quite right. I requested an MRI, he said no need, I urged, he ordered it. When the symptoms started resolving, as they usually had, I didn\'t schedule the MRI.\n\nEnd of November of 2019, another painful flare-up, the sciatica being worse this time, along with tingling in feet and testicles (though the tingling subsided with core exercises). I still had the MRI referral so I got it. Results: herniations at l4/l5 and l5/s1 - the former being enormous (14+mm). Severe spinal stenosis, DDD, the like. Not tight hamstrings. Primary physician said surgery likely because of how long I\'ve been having symptoms. First neurosurgeon visit, he scheduled me for Microdiscectomy / Hemilaminectomy / Facectomy. 2nd opinion said it was the right move. A neurosurgeon friend of a friend said ""Holy shit, you need surgery.""\n\nI felt surgery was necessary, but was terrified of surgical failure and having to eventually get a fusion. The pain and severity of the MRI findings eventually made my decision, and I went through with surgery on January 9th.\n\nArrived at the hospital, told them how sick I get under anesthesia. Whatever they gave me for the nausea worked - no nausea in the slightest, a first for me. Woke up after surgery with zero sciatic pain and I felt more aware then the two other times I\'ve been under. They wanted me walking right away, and I was home in bed before I knew it (less than two hours from waking up from surgery). Seemed crazy quick, but they must have it down pat.\n\nThe first few days were painful in the incision area. I was given only enough percocet for a day and a half. Put a call into the doc on Friday (day 1 post-op) and never heard back till the following Tuesday. They apologized for dropping the ball on this. After the perc ran out, I used Tylenol with codeine for a few days. I was up walking around the house a bunch on Day 1 post-op. Day 2 I took a really short walk around the block.\n\nDay 3 I walked a little bit more, and was surprised with how mobile I felt. By Day 5 I was walking two-three miles a day, which I\'ve kept up every day. Yesterday (Day 9) I walked 4.5 miles. I think this might have been pushing it, but I feel best when I\'m moving so decided to listen to my body.\n\nRecovery has been uneventful, and much easier than I anticipated based on other accounts. I\'ve had a few ""scares"" - bumping into furniture, some weird aches and pains here and there, scared I was getting a blood clot - but everything seems okay still.\n\nTomorrow I have my first follow up. My body is pretty stiff and I can\'t wait to start PT / begin stretching. Though I still have surgical pain, I believe my lower back pain was helped with the surgery as well (doc said it could go either way on that front). Will follow up on this as surgical pain diminishes. Still no sciatic pain AT ALL. A tiny bit of tingling in the feet here and there, but almost phantom-like.\n\nHappy to answer any questions and follow-up again if wanted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: A couple things that worked for me I thought I\'d share:\n\n* Using a sports bladder to drink water. This way, when you\'re laying down recovering, you can stay super hydrated. And it also makes you pee a ton, which is good for forcing you to get up and move every hour.\n* Kombucha / probiotics / psyllium husk in smoothies - keep that gut healthy! Poops have been great, no constipation at all. \n* Grabber device is super helpful. As is a Sock Aid - put on your own socks!\n* Toilet seat riser - 5 inch rise, made it very easy for the first week to use the toilet. \n* Have a wife. Lots of yummy meals and I got out of cleaning the first few days :) \n* Keep moving.'"

Each year, it seemed like a new one got added to the list.  2020 just handed me a xylitol allergy, so now I can\'t use any toothpastes sold in American stores.  Everything has artificial sweeteners or sugar alcohols in it.  \n\nI\'ve been brushing with baking soda and water for the past month.  Today I went to my dentist and he just said ""Find a toothpaste that doesn\'t have them,"" and I begged him for a chlorhexidine mouthwash prescription since baking soda and water is not going to be sufficient long-term.  He gave me one prescription with no refills, saying it would stain my teeth and I shouldn\'t use it too much.  The CVS told me the chlorhexidine has saccharin in it, so they gave me the number of a compounding pharmacy that ""might"" be able to make it for me.  \n\n(If you are curious about the nature of the allergy, my throat and tongue swell up, I get a headache, a sore throat, runny nose, and watery eyes.  I floss every day, so when I eat something I\'m allergic to, I bleed which is unusual.  If I continuously eat it, I begin wheezing and become short of breath.  Benadryl helps.)\n\nI don\'t really want to have to pay an arm and a leg for compounded toothpastes or mouthwashes.  I have Keystone First Medicaid.  I picked up an ayurvedic herbal toothpaste today at the Indian grocery store, but that is more from desperation than the belief that brushing fruit extracts onto my teeth is great.  \n\nThe list of sugar alcohols that are currently safe are: sorbitol, erythritol (monk fruit extract), and maltitol.  Possibly more, but those are just the ones I run into on a daily basis.  \n\n**Please let me know:**\n\n* what suggestions you have\n* if you miraculously know a toothpaste I can use\n* if you know a fluoridated, unsweetened mouthwash.  \n* If there is a way to get compounded toothpastes / mouthwashes covered by insurance.

I am on PPI medication for the GERD (diagnosed in November after an endoscopy), and I have been diagnosed with IBS for years upon a colonoscopy after the onset of symptoms over a decade ago. I was supposed to have an endoscopy at the beginning of the week, but a complication arrived - I have previously been diagnosed with Von Willebrand\'s (the mild form) and the medication I use before procedures (DDAVP nasal) was recalled according to the anesthetist office arranging the prep and appointments. I had a blood draw and the hematologist has the test results and I\'m waiting to hear back from the anesthetist folks to arrange another endoscopy with the GI results (phew!). From the relatively small amount of blood, and the red color, I would guess that I either have an ulcer or keep tearing something during the vomiting spells. Hopefully the endoscopy will confirm this, I can get treatment, and go about my life.\n\nThe thing is, I don\'t know what\'s bringing on headaches so severe that the only things that have been helping have been prescribed Vicodin and (legal, in my state) weed.\n\nSome potentially relevant things: I have had IBS symptoms following a penicillin shot around age 20. After a bout of bloody diarrhea following a week long illness, I went for the colonoscopy, started elimination diets, and so forth. My gallbladder has been tested a couple of times, the first where it was barely functional, and the second where it worked fine. I have periodic IBS flare-ups, but it has mostly been manageable so far, and while I have trigger foods I can\'t pinpoint a root cause for the flare-ups. Usually it manifests as discomfort/indigestion/diarrhea, but sometimes I throw up the contents of my stomach undigested hours after having eaten the food. I live in the USA and have decent health insurance, but not unlimited funds for wild goose chase tests. I\'d really just like to be pointed in some good directions to look for a diagnosis.

corticosteroid swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/71s88n/allergist_wont_see_me_because_of_antihistamine/,"b""Allergist won't see me because of antihistamine addiction.""",,"b'Edit: Holy cow. What a whirlwind ride this has been since finding out its not just allergies. \n\nI got the CT Scan for the nasal polyps. They said all but one sinus was 100% blocked. They said no allergy medicine, steroid, decongestants, anything could have done jack for me. So, 3 days ago, they did ""The ol\' scraperoo"". Took out ALL the nasal polyps, and widened my sinuses for better drainage. It took about 7 hours from when i was put under to when i woke up. Apparently it may have been the worst case that the ENT has seen, and the files from it are being discussed around the whole office as something like a freak show (or maybe something to learn from, lol). It\'s only been 3 days since they did this, and this is WILD! I CAN BREATHE! I am so delighted already about this. I can\'t believe I\'ve been suffering for so long, panting out of my mouth, not able to smell, sniffle, or breathe even for a few minutes for the past year, thinking this was my life forever. \n\nBut, it comes at a price. I do have a very strict daily regimen of care to try to keep it this way. With how bad the polyps had gotten, that fast, it will be a challenge to keep them under control. For the rest of my life, I will be on:\nA daily nasal rinse to rinse out allergens from my sinuses.\nA daily nasal steroid to keep polyps in check and keep swelling down.\nA daily Singulair, a daily antihistamine, a daily inhaled corticosteroid  (i also have asthma), and a daily saline spray to keep things in check and keep from suffering.\n\nBut hell. If that\'s the price to breathe, so worth it. And people can understand me! No one has said, ""Oh, you sound sick"" in the last two days yet!!!\n\nAlso, I BEAT THE ANTIHISTAMINE ADDICTION! All it took was switching from zyrtec to Claritin, and Claritin is easy to miss days of. If I miss a day of zyrtec, I itched like wildfire. Like fire ants were biting my while body. If I miss a Claritin- nothing!\n\n\nEdit: Thanks all for letting me rant, I just needed peoppe who\'ve experienced this to listen.\n\nThanks to those of you who suggested I need an ENT for the nasal polyps. I see him at the end of the month! We are getting there!\n\nAlso, the itching I\'m talking about when I stop taking Zyrtec isn\'t an allergy issue (that I know of). Zyrtec causes some strange sort of withdrawal for some people, where, regardless of exposure to allergies, about 24 hours after taking it, your entire body starts itching like crazy. So bad people can\'t help but scratch their skin open. It\'s known, but so far it looks like the medical companies haven\'t looked into it that I can find. So, while I appreciate the suggestions of staying at hotels, and the suggestions of having to suck it up and be sniffly, this is a strange withdrawal type thing, not an ""I\'m allergic to something"" thing. As far as I can tell, the Zyrtec doesn\'t do anything for my allergies anyway at this point. I just take it so I don\'t itch.\n\nSo, I\'m using another antihistamine right now, and that means I make it 16-20 hours before the itching starts. Hopefully by the time I\'m done with the ENT, I can stop taking the new antihistamine and see an allergist. \n\n-End edit-\n\n\nI have severe allergies. Environmental, indoor, dust mites, all of it. In the last 3 years (I\'m 31), it\'s suddenly gotten way worse. My regular doctor can\'t help me anymore than he has (Antihistamine, nasal steroid, Singulair, tried Benadryl, tried every allergy medicine that exists, had surgery to straighten my septum and reduce turbinates). So he suggested I see an allergist again. Cool, I would love not to feel like this every day.\n\nI can\'t breathe out of my nose. Ever. It\'s too congested. I have nasal polyps I can see in the mirror. Half the time, my sinuses are so clogged, I hear like I\'m underwater. My nose runs all night when I try to lay down.\n\nSo today I called to make the appointment with high expectations. They literally will not even talk to me because I can\'t stop taking antihistamines for 3 days. My body is addicted to the antihistamines. I would literally, seriously, rather die than deal with that extreme itching that comes with not taking an antihistamine. \n\nSo, I guess this is my life now. I\'ll just be that weird mouth breather. That\'s fine. No, don\'t worry that no one can understand me on the phone since I sound so congested. Everything is just fine.'"

I knew that it doesn\'t cure Bruxism, but I figured it would stop the pressure on my teeth and redirect it to the nightguard. Two problems:\n\n1. The nightguard is slowly destroyed over the course of six months until it reaches the point where my teeth can touch while the nightguard is in place (huge holes where teeth should go). The nightguard I use is professionally made (melded for my teeth) and very thick (apparently the maximum thickness that my dentist can make it). He tried thinner materials for the nightguard at first, but they were destroyed in under a month.\n\n2. The nightguard doesn\'t absorb nearly enough pressure from bruxing. I recently (3 months ago) was told by my dentist that a piece of my tooth was gone. I asked him how that was possible since I never remembered losing pieces of my teeth. He said that based on the continued (though reduced) wear to my other teeth, the nightguard is not completely absorbing the force from my grinding/clenching behavior.\n\nI\'ve done research on methods for dealing with bruxism, and there is not much information at all on the subject really. There are no bruxism specialists (well, no field in denistry that encompasses bruxism besides general denistry, I mean). My dentist (when I asked what could be done) shrugged and said ""Try biofeedback of some sort.""\n\nBiofeedback seems like the most promising option, but electric-shock-based biofeedback appears to rely on unreliable muscle sensors. Patients can unconsciously learn to avoid the avoid triggering the biofeedback device by using different muscles for bruxing. Additionally, the body can get used to the shocks over time and just ignore the device.\n\nSound-based biofeedback seems even less reliable, as it has the same problems with sensing bruxing and even greater likelihood of the body ignoring the sound made by the device.\n\nTaste-based biofeedback sounds intriguing, but the process is privately patented and there is no commercial device available. I wouldn\'t know where to begin with turning the schematics for that device into a real metal appliance.\n\nI have a lot of neck and shoulder pain and pretty horrible headaches most of the time, in addition, my jaw muscles are pretty overly developed, which looks pretty weird.

Because of the flight time/time zone  difference, I was awake for a total of ~48 hours by the time I returned home. I slept for approx 12 hours. Later on Saturday May 6, I began to feel that old familiar burning sensation of PHN on my back torso. Then as the week progressed and still now, I also developed the worst flare up of eczema Ive ever had. Usually I get a tiny patch under my chin. But this time I have large areas of eczema all over my face and on the back of my neck. Itching is unbearable, and along with the PHN (which has not subsided at all), Im feeling kinda miserable.\n\nI am taking Advil for the PHN and Benadryl and Claritin for the eczema and seasonal allergies, (which returned to their normal levels once I was back in my home state). Edited post to add that I also use Cortisone 10 cream on the eczema patches for itch relief.\n\nMy guess is the stress of being awake for 48 hours, flying in a germy pressurized metal tube breathing recycled air for around 12 hours (including a 3 hour layover in another airport), and then the onslaught of returning to my home environment full of allergens. My poor immune system just took a shit and is overreacting.\nThe eczema is migrating all over my face and not really clearing up, the PHN is also migrating to the front of my torso and the pain level has not subsided at all. \n\nFINALLY TO THE POINT OF MY POST..\nShould I see my regular doctor? Should I find a dermatologist? Should I just wait this out and continue to medicate with OTC meds that only relieve the symptoms? Is there anything I can do? Neither the PHN or the eczema has ever been this bad. Im at a loss!'"

Advil vomit,https://www.reddit.com/r/headaches/comments/dkdn28/weird_headaches_feels_like_something_is_wrong/,b'Weird Headaches: Feels Like Something is Wrong',,"b'Hello,\n\nI am a 24 year old female on no meds who was diagnosed with a case of vestibular neuritis, beginning August 17th. I woke up that day extremely dizzy and nauseous, vomited twice, and had some diarrhea. The dizziness (spinning, like vertigo), lasted another two days, though no more vomiting. It started to get a bit better, and then the dizziness rapidly shifted feeling - from spinning to rocking, as if I was on a boat. I was taking Gravol to control the ensuing nausea (as I am already quite prone to motion sickness). Initially I was unable to read or look at a computer, but I was able to lie down and watch mindless TV. These symptoms gradually abated after about 7 weeks.\n\nDuring this time I went to see two ENTs and a neurologist, and had an MRI (on August 27th, found to be normal). After describing my symptoms, I was diagnosed with vestibular neuritis rather than vestibular migraines (that was a concern, as I am generally prone to migraines, though never before have I experienced something of this nature), since I was not experiencing headaches during this time.\n\nAt my last appointment with my ENT on September 20th, the doctor had me lie down with my head hanging over the edge of the table to test how I felt. I immediately felt nauseous, and when I went home I wasnt feeling well and I went to sleep. I woke up and felt quite intense pressure in my neck and at the top left side of my head.\n\nSince this time I have had these odd pressure-pain headaches almost every day. They travel around, generally beginning at the base of my skull, to follow along to either the top left or right of my head, and often concentrate near my temples (above my ear). At first I thought they might be tension headaches, but I also feel tenderness around the areas where the pain is, and its been weeks that Ive had these symptoms now. Neither regular Advil, Tylenol, nor Voltaren/Naproxen alleviate the pain, and Im starting to worry that theres something wrong.\n\nI have also had some jaw pain on-and-off since August, and although this might be potentially unrelated, I have had symptoms of costichondritis as well as soreness around the joints in my arms and my lower legs since early September.\n\nI am getting quite anxious, and I do not know what to do - I know what normal headaches and migraines feel like, and these arent them. Does anyone have any ideas? Should I consider getting another MRI, considering the headache symptoms started about a month after the initial dizziness (and thus after my first - and only - MRI)?\n\nThank you.'"

I wonder if the acetaminophen would have made a big difference. I happened to have some dayquil and took a swig of that (probably another 15mg of dex). 2-3 hours go by. still nothing. I figure to call it quits on the cough medicine and just have some soup and keep loading up on water. I start feeling a little hazy, but I didn\'t think anything of it. another 45 minutes go by and i\'m really starting to feel funny, but just stay calm and keep drinking water. Another hour goes by and I feel REALLY REALLY weird. Mind you at this point, the first dose I had should have worn off, if not the second dose as well. I\'m freaking out a little and feel like i\'m about to pass out. I go in the bathroom. My eyes are completely dilated. I\'m like... shit. what happened. The dayquil WAS in a sunny area.. maybe the composition broke down and changed? I know I shook it well before taking it so it\'s not like I got more of one thing than the other...

The main effects are anxiety and paranoia.

If you\'re having weird effects from meds not being monitored by a doctor, don\'t sleep. wait for the effects to wear off first) I stayed up til 3am til I felt okay to sleep and was iffy the next day.\n\nTL;DR Took 2 doses of cough syrup while on bupropion and had a very unpleasant trip that crawled up on me and continuously got worse very slowly for hours mainly causing anxiety and paranoia.'"

On July 31st I started having diarrhea, on the August 8th I was diagnosed with diverticulitis. This whole sickness brought back my anxiety which I hadn\'t had in over 8 years. They put me on Augmentin. Every day I would come home from work and lay in my recliner in the living room in misery and exhaustion until I fell asleep to Youtube. After I finish the course I was still sick, they gave me one dose of Bactrim and Flagyl. I did not take the Bactrim again due to anxiety, and the flagyl I took about two days more. Somewhere in between all this I started to just sometimes sleep on the couch in the living room or on a mattress in the floor. Right in front of the TV, it kind of helped me sleep it seemed. I guess I picked this up from ""hey you are always falling asleep here, why not sleep here."" \n\nThis pattern got more and more to where I would only sleep in the living room. I had a bunch more trips to the ER, due to the anxiety and such. One night, we spent all night in the ER... Get home at 3am, sleep in the living room. Wake up at 5am and went back to the ER. 2 hours of sleep, and when we got home we just fought it until that night. Well, I tried to sleep in the recliner and couldn\'t through the day. Little noises would bother me, like I was on high alert or something. Or I would just fall asleep and almost immediately wake back up. So that night I sleep on the couch and probably get 3-4 hours of sleep. \n\nThe next night I started having troubles falling asleep, getting up going for rides to try to help, toss and turn. I get 2 hours of sleep. Next night 3 hours.\n\nLast night try to go to sleep. In the living room in the floor after taking a calming ride and a Hydroxyzine. I can\'t do it.

Like I am conscious of everything going on... \n\nAlso as I lay there with my eyes closed, I feel like I feel I am vibrating a little.\n\nSometimes I fall asleep by my mind running off on little tangents that make absolutely no sense.

Sleeping in front of a bright TV? Usually sleep in front of a TV, but not so close.  Could this be the whole case? Do you see any other glaring mistakes or causes? My anxiety has been taking control of me it seems, could this be the reason? If it is the switching of the room how hard would the transition to sleeping normally be?

I was ultimately cured of the sinus infection but the day after finishing the medication I started having sleep issues and have continued having sleep issues to this day. \n\nI've seen my doctor multiple times and we've tried olanzapine and then trazodone combined with melatonin and a weighted blanket. Sometimes I'm able to fall asleep with just melatonin and weighted blanket, other times I wake up around 12am from light sleep and need to take half a pill of trazodone and even then sleep isn't guaranteed. Sometimes I end up laying awake the entire night or falling asleep at 5am. I'm now looking into trying CBT-i but it hasn't been useful as I've been reliant on trazodone to fall asleep for the past week. I've also tried using the Calm app but it also hasn't been super helpful. \n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience with Amoxicillin and how did you work on fixing your sleep?

I feel like I often don't deserve what I get, but I don't feel super smart. I feel like I can't accept even a routine scholarship because I don't feel worthy, even though my parents and everyone I know tells me that I am smart.\n\nI also have been keeping some things apart from my parents and family. I've never told them or hinted that I don't have faith in their god. They've never expressed any distrust of those who are like me, but I have zero clue how they would react and I'm totally dependent on them for my living. \n\nIn my mind, I regularly am thinking about the whole world and how people who are just like me live lives worse than my own and so I feel guilty for it when I know I'm not. I can't ignore it, and I feel like I can't help but tell others about these things, to the point where I neglect classes and dates. \n\nI have regularly stopped what I've doing for minutes at a time, up to an hour, just suddenly mentally paralyzed by thoughts I don't want to have, usually in the middle of the night. Sometimes it's about oblivion (the non religious view of it), sometimes it's about my family, sometimes it's about other things, but I try everything like trying to hug myself or the parent I live with if she's nearby, just to make it stop. \n\nI regularly stay up at night, with very random, wild, and convoluted sleep cycles.\n\nI have a lot of difficulty crying, even when I know that others would probably do so when I feel the way I do, and being unable to do so makes me doubt my own problems and understanding of whether I'm in a good situation or not.\n\nI regularly feel other effects, even being unable to take showers on a regular basis because the white surrounding me without a real difference from one centimetre to the next makes me feel dissociated from myself.\n\nI should also tell you that I have autism, high functioning autism.\n\nI don't drink much alcohol, maybe 65 grams of pure alcohol over a one month period, and I don't take any other drugs other than OTC NSAIDs for a wicked cough, nor any prescription drugs.\n\nI've had other problems like this in the past, like extreme aerophobia where the flight attendants literally had to drag me onto the plane with me holding a blanket at the really embarrassing age of weeks away from being 13, when a few days before I had a hallucination that Satan was next to my bed as I woke from a nightmare and I ran upstairs and slept there for days. For a year when I was 15, I was embroiled in an extremely painful existential crisis, mostly over faith but also how I was to grow older. I couldn't shower for weeks at a time because of the problem I mentioned before.\n\nI have been unable to explain how I feel to anyone in person. My doctor isn't stupid, but I don't feel like she's the doctor I chose, and because of the way my finances and difficulty with independent travel on the spot are, with bad public transport in a very low density suburb, I feel dependent on my parents for getting even basic medical care. \n\nThe one good thing is that I'm not suicidal, but I certainly don't feel happy about my life.

I sort of felt like for this situation he should\'ve been seen by an oral surgeon. It took nearly 4 hours. Honestly I thought my husband\'s teeth were so bad that he should\'ve just opted to get dentures. He\'s had 5-10 fillings in back teeth, 3-4 teeth pulled, most of the top front teeth are all either knocked out or snapped at the gum line and most of the remaining teeth that are there have no enamel\nleft, and have severe cavities at the gum line. I thought for sure there was just no other option than to take them all out and have dentures put in.\nBut...The dentist convinced my husband to opt for having a\nseries of procedures instead because he had ""a few usable teeth"" remaining. \nTo date this dentist has added 4 new fillings, 4 route canals and 2 crowns. Last night they were going in to removed the remaining teeth so that my husband could be given a partial and although I thought he would be sent to oral surgeon, it was done in office with a local anesthetic. I was told it was done that way because the dentist was trying to ""help us"" reserve some available funds on the insurance so\nthat we could bill for a temporary partial, a nicer permanent partial and a couple implants, and keep our part of the cost down. So far we\'re in for over $1,000 out of pocket even with really good dental insurance that most people would kill to have. \nMy husband is in a world of pain right now, he was given ibuprofen and penicillin but it\'s not really doing much for him. When he woke up his pillow was covered in blood that leaked from his mouth. His lips, cheeks, and even under his eyes are all swollen. His gums have a decent amount of swelling and stitches.\n\n**Now that I\'ve given you a history, here are my questions...**\n\n**1- Do you agree with the procedures not being done by a surgeon and the way this was\ndone in office with only local anesthetic and no narcotic pain medication?**\n\n**2 - He was sent home with the temporary partial, how long should he wait to wear it? I have perfect teeth so I don\'t know from experience but I think common sense says he should wait at least until the swelling goes down, and maybe even until fully healed. \nThe dentist said he could wear it right away though, so rather than go to work with all his front\nteeth missing, and rather than take my advice, my stubborn husband forced the damn partial into his mouth this morning even with all that swelling and with fresh sutures in his gums**\n\n**3- Would you have ever advised a patient of yours to have this amount of work done rather than having all the teeth removed and giving them dentures? Is it just a matter of opinion, or is there a standard for how much dental work is too much to recommend a patient endure?**'"

I\'m a selfish asshole, and I only care about me, but it\'s impossible not to when there\'s so much stimuli dancing around my mind, frustrating me, angering me, guilting me, putting me into a position of powerlessness.. and then other days I\'m cheery and the things that the other day nearly made me want to rip my own skin off, I\'ll not even bat an eye towards, going so far as to laugh. My moods go to complete shit, and I have absolutely no control over it, and it is all consuming. I am so assumptive of things, that I realize now that it seems like it almost borders on paranoia.

Still literally sitting still, still hanging onto the hope that my poor coping techniques will one day magically just start to work. I\'m at a point where I realize that for therapies and counselling to be effective that I need to be medicated, because I get nowhere where I am. The all consuming pessimist in me knows that it\'ll fail once again, so let\'s not bother. Everything \\*\\*always\\*\\* falls apart, no matter how good it seems and no matter if I\'ve manged it longer this time than the last. My life is miserable. I\'ve got stockholm syndrome and my captor is my own self.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\'m so fucking scared to try this medication though. I\'ve never had anything beyond ssri\'s and wellbutrin (which didnt work out too well). These classes of drugs scare me. I don\'t want to be a drone. I like my happy two or three days every couple months - or do I really? Maybe being content and mostly happy the majority of the time is better. I don\'t know. See, I\'m already assuming I know exactly how this is going to work out when in reality, I don\'t have a fucking clue. It could be a god send, it could not work anything like I imagine, I could end up with a life long debilitating condition as a result, who knows, I gotta try it right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy am I so fucking scared to have the life I deserve?'"

Its a long read but I hope it helps someone out there get tested if they are on the fence about whether or not they have ADHD!\n\nLet me start by saying that I was diagnosed with ADHD At 10 years old but decided to gaslight myself into believing that I was misdiagnosed because I was a good student (I just couldnt sit still in elementary school). My parents put me on Concerta for a week and it made me so aggressive that I actually pushed my best friend (I would never ever hurt anyone). As a result, I avoided meds for the next 21 years of my life because of an irrational fear of being dependent on medicine that could turn me into a different person. I was so weird about meds that I even avoided pain meds like Advil and Tylenol.\n\nWhen it came to school, I always worked myself to the point of sickness and exhaustion just to get a B or A in my classes. I always thought I just needed to work harder than everyone, to the point where I was sick with a stress induced cold/flu every month! I was skipping class week after week because I barely even had time to sleep with how much I had to study to keep up. But I kept my grades high regardless. I thought maybe I had an autoimmune disorder, and that I would just have to live with sickness for my whole life. \n\nSocially, I always felt just slightly different from my peers. I like to think that I am incredibly personable and a great listener, but I always felt like I was stuck right between introverted and extroverted. I go through week long periods of recovery where I MUST be alone after a few days of intense social interaction. And sometimes I feel socially awkward out of nowhere and have a hard time speaking my thoughts coherently. My friends used to get upset that I would never reach out to them and always waited for them to make plans with me. When confronting them about how I feel and my insecurities, they always told me that it was just in my head because they love hanging out with me and chatting. As a result, I chocked my mood swings and recovery periods to manic depression and assumed I would just have to live with it forever. I told myself that I was just an introverted extrovert.\n\nThings continued like this for a while until this fall semester, the start of my senior year studying computer science at university. Something was not right. I was skipping half my classes and just couldnt get myself interested in the material. I was smoking daily to cope with a deep depression and stopped reaching out to people. I was just sick, lonely, and felt like a failure. I couldnt even get myself to go to the grocery store to buy food for myself. I hit rock bottom when I failed two midterms and realized that my dream of cum laude had vanished before my eyes.\n\nI decided to get retested by a psychologist and was once again was diagnosed with ADHD-C. I was scared and sad that something was wrong with my brain and didnt want to believe it. My doctor prescribed 10mg or adderall 1-2x/day for my school days and I was apprehensive given my past. I finally decided to just try it on one of my 8 hour school days and figured that if it made me feel weird I could just stop immediately.\n\nThat day literally changed my life forever. For the first time in my life, I could actually understand each word coming out of my professors mouth. It was crystal clear! I also felt this new, deep love for learning. I was fascinated by my classes and couldnt wait to watch YouTube videos on the content we were learning (yes, the very same classes just a week ago I was skipping). My restless legs stilled and I had no desire to fidget. No boredom, no sadness, no depression. Just a love for learning. It was the first time ever that I did not have to teach myself the content out of the textbook because I actually UNDERSTOOD the whole lecture!!\n\nAfter that first class, I had this uncontrollable urge to just speak to everyone and make so many new friends. I sent texts to old friends asking to hang out, filled up my weekend with plans, and started random conversations with people in my classes who I would NEVER talk to. I went from never reaching out to accidentally double or triple booking my nights with plans. I also got this weird feeling where I just want to tell everyone how amazing and beautiful they are are and call my family members to tell them I love them. So thats what I did, I called my mom and told her how lucky I am to have her in my life and texted my best friends letting them know I love them. This is SO unlike me, I NEVER reach out, I hate phone calls, and I have way too much anxiety to talk to strangers.\n\nThat full 8 hour day felt like a breeze. Normally, I would have come home and taken a nap, but instead I CHOSE to go to the grocery store after school! I cleaned my apartment and still had the energy to start my homework. \n\nIts been 2 weeks since that day and I have not missed a single class. Infact, for the first time in my life, I actually look forward to my longer school days. I start my homework on time, I reach out to friends, and my desire to smoke has disappeared. Ive even been going on dates again and have really been impressing boys with my new conversation skills. I am finally the person that I have always wanted to be. My fraternity friends say that I am a different person and that it is clear as day to them how much happier I am.  \n\nIf you are like me and felt socially awkward, or are working yourself to death, or are not taking care of your own health, PLEASE GO GET TESTED FOR ADHD. You do not need to live like this for the rest of your life. Thank you for hearing my story. If anyone else has had a similar experience (especially with social anxiety) I would love to hear and chat with you about it!'"

It has worked better than any antidepressant I have tried in the past, and I'm able to function normally now. I have every intention of continuing it.\n\nHowever, these benefits have come with one somewhat concerning side effect: my hair is thinning. I have noticed much more shedding than usual in my bed and on the carpet. When I do my laundry, the lint trap is full of my hair. I have always had very thick hair, but now it is possible to see my scalp in some areas. My hair also feels different than usual when I run my hand through it. The changes are especially apparent when my hair is wet.\n\nAll of this started about a month after I began taking the drug. I haven't experienced this sort of hair loss in response to stress in the past. And from [what I've read](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28763345/), it seems bupropion is more often the culprit of this than other antidepressants.\n\nI'd like to stay on this drug. The pros absolutely outweigh the cons. But are there any ways to mitigate this hair thinning while I am on it (other than the usual advice to live a healthy lifestyle)? Will the hair thinning attenuate as my body adapts to the drug?"""

A few weeks later I tried taking ibuprofen once a day since that actually helps the sciatic nerve. But on the second night I woke up with horrific heartburn. So I switched to voltarol gel. And not only did I get heartburn within two minutes of applying it (no joke!), but I swelled up again, my arms started hurting, and I got terrible brain fog as well as bizarre mood swings and crying spells that I associate with the withdrawal symptoms when coming off an antidepressant. Apparently even topical NSAIDs can cause stomach problems and water retention, and all NSAIDs carry the risk of causing depression, nervousness, and mood swings, particularly in people who have affective disorders (eg depression and bipolar). So I thought I would post about it given how many people on here are probably on one NSAID or another.'"

It is intensely sharp whenever I laugh, cry, or speak in anything above a normal voice. It is also painful when I swallow, although to a lesser degree, especially if I turn my head to the right. Sometimes the pain stretches into my left ear, sometimes not. It subsides for a swallow or two if I clear my throat first or stick out my tongue as far as I can.\n\nI imagine this sounds weird, but its been going on since the end of September, getting slowly but steadily worse, so Ive tried all kinds of stuff to get the pain to lessen. \n\nI have seen my EENT twice about it, but he has focused on lymph tissue and my tonsils. The two visits have turned up swollen lymph tissue around the tonsils, which antiseptic mouthwash cleared up, as well as swollen lymph nodes on the left side of my neck, for which he prescribed a weeks worth of penicillin. \nNeither of these treatments helped with the pain. \n\nIt is starting to move beyond an annoyance to something intense enough to move me to tears, which unfortunately makes it hurt much worse.

Sure enough, in the lymph tissue behind my left tonsil, theres a little nodule, almost like a zit or a blister. Thats the culprit.  \n\nCould it be a cyst?

It has seemed to mostly keep my blood pressure at around 120 over 80.\n\nI have no known family history of Multiple Sclerosis.\n\nFully vaccinated...for everything including Covid.\n\nI ran cross country and track in high school and college.  My running continued into my late twenties...but I mostly switched to another sport (which involves a lot of running).  Before all this happened, I considered myself to be active and agile and strong.  I worked out regularly.  I have worked occasionally as a gardener for the past several years.\n\nMy diet is probably higher than normal for dairy products and I probably eat a lot of flour as I like to make sourdough bread and other baking products often.  The one thing that is high in my blood tests were my cholesterol numbers...probably because my family likes whole milk, cheese, and yogurt so much.  My doctor was not concerned about that though.\n\nI injured myself in early 2021 doing a box jump.  Missed it. Landed on my shins.  Gouged a chunk of skin out of my right shin.  Still have a scar.  On my left shin, I got a big deep bruise.  I thought I healed up fine from this injury.\n\nGot Covid on August 1st.  About three days into that I woke up from a nap.  Was about to get up when my left shin felt started having a burning searing, spasmy pain.  I realized later that this was exactly across from my scar on my right leg.  The pain is above a 7 when it starts...but usually settles down to an ache and then sometimes goes away.  Sometimes it just aches and aches.  So, went to urgent care clinic.  They took an ultrasound to rule out a blood clot/DVT.   They said they found some wall thickening.  Diagnosed me with a chronic pain condition called Superficial Thromboplebitis. Prescribed me to take Paxlovid and an over the counter NSAID. \n\nThings that set off the pain: If I got out of a cold shower into hot air or came from air conditioning into a hot car.  That would really set it off.  Also kneeling on my knee would set off the ache and if I was not careful, would probably set off the high level pain.\n\nAnyways, I took the Paxlovid and one expired Aleve and the pain ceased pretty much immediately.  I almost forgot about it.\n\nOn October 13th, I had just finished walking a half mile in the morning, when the pain/ache returned.  I was a few days into a cold.

I also had a poison ivy-like skin reaction to the gel that they used during the Ultrasound.  As a gardener, I often get Poison Ivy, so I keep a Prednisone taper prescription on hand. I used it here. I believe it worked stopping my allergic reaction for the rash.  I do not believe the rash was related to whatever else is bothering me, however, taking Prednisone may have affected it.  Using this steroid may have been the reason why the pain settled down for awhile.\n\nThe pain mostly was manageable for awhile, but became high level again on about November 4th.  This is when I finally got to see a better doctor.  He ordered several blood tests and an EMG.  Also referred me to see a specialist for Long Term Covid and also a spine doctor.  Told me to start taking 1800 mg Ibuprofen a day.  The blood tests showed that I was normal or negative for just about everything. \n\nAfter that November 4th appointment, I had more symptoms appear. Basically I got a bunch of spots in my calves and shins and especially on the insides of my lower legs including my ankles that felt like the muscle was catching or pinching. Stretching did not help. This bothered me so much that I could barely walk. I believe the Ibuprofen dosage eventually allowed the symptoms to pass.almost completely. \n\nI also got my last Covid booster shortly after this appointment.\n\nSo, with no symptoms, that is when I got the EMG, saw the covid and spine doctors.  EMG said that my nerves were functioning appropriately.  Covid specialist said that I did not check off enough of the Covid boxes to be considered having Long Term Covid. Spine doctor indicated that my pain did not radiate down the nerves from my back, so a cause coming from my back was unlikely. He did say that I should get an MRIso I am working on that.\n\nThe Covid person told me to not take so much Ibuprofen. So, I started taking Aleve and Aleve PM instead. The Aleve PM kinda sort helps me sleep through the pain.\n\nI am also requesting a test for Lyme Disease and Hypothyroidismbecause they both can cause Peripheral Neuropathy.\n\nBasically, my one painful spot comes and goes. And I have a variety of other symptoms. Mostly I just feel various spots in my body. They just feel weird. In my right calf and shin. And especially in my left forearm. My right forearm and wrist. In my left lower back. Other symptoms are that I woke up yesterday to the tips of my fingers being numb. I was able to shake them and get feeling back. I have had a slight head ache occasionally. \n\nBecause of my one painful spot, I can only limp around. I have rarely left my house in the last three weeks. It is really hard to work out when you cant use one of your legs, so I have not worked out in quite a while.\n\nOne other symptom is that my temperature seems consistently low. 97.2 is common. Once, I measured 96.6 at the doctors office. And my feet and ankles are almost always cold to the touch of my hands. I have been wearing a ton of clothes and hat lately and being buried underneath blankets at nightway more than I used to. I know it is recently winterbut my body just does not seem to generate much heat. I used to wake up in the morning in a cocoon of heatand now it seems like there is no heat when I wake up.\n\nFeel free to ask me questions.'"

Tetracycline swelling,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/12sizfn,b'Feeling totally hopeless with my skin.',"Image344.jpg, Image345.jpg, Image346.jpg","b'Around age 12 I struggled with acne in my t-zone area. I saw a dermatologist who had me on clindamycin, differin, a facial scrub from their spa and cetaphil daily moisturizer with sunscreen. They also had me doing chemical peels with extractions twice a month. \n\nThis routine went on for years with no improvement. Throughout that time, they had me try minocycline, tetracycline, and other topical products I cant recall from their spa. Im not sure what caused such severe scarring on my forehead but it was around this time that it started to get bad.\n\nMy family struggled financially and my mom couldnt afford to keep up with the expenses of treatments and products especially since it seemed to be worsening my skin with scarring and not solving the acne issue.\n\nThroughout my teen years I managed it, but its always followed me. Around 19 I started to develop horrible cystic acne. I went to another dermatologist and was put on accurate. It was the only thing that ever made my skin clear and improved the appearance of my scars. Unfortunately I developed GI issues and had other side effects, causing me to quit usage after 3 months.\n\nIm now almost 29 and Im at a complete loss. Ive tried many different ingredients and topicals and my skin is extremely sensitive. \n\nFor the past year, the routine that my dermatologist has me on is Vanicream gentle cleanser, Tret, Vanicream daily hydration moisturizer and spf (I use Supergoop glow screen because its the only thing that doesnt break me out.) She also recommended 2-3 sessions of Diamond Glow facial. I did my first Diamond Glow a month ago and it didnt seem to do much of anything. The esthetician went over my lips during the facial and now my lips have been constantly peeling on the top and bottom. They also swelled up one day like they were reacting to something. My dermatologist said she thinks I have lip excema. Needless to say, I dont really care to do another Diamond Glow. \n\nIm at a loss and am looking for other opinions on what the best path / treatment plan is for my skin. Ive had no luck finding people who struggle with similar forehead scarring and any possible treatment. I should also note that I do not pick at or touch active acne besides throwing on a pimple patch, my skin just scars incredibly easily. What are your thoughts?'"

It was very slow to start but it was definitely there. Went over to a friends and when I left i was extremely exhausted and the migraine was getting worse.

I got up at 8am and nothing had changed, everything just got worse. My migraine is really painful and its making my eyes feel like theyre going to swell up and burst, my temples feel like theres someone just pushing their knuckles into it, my teeth feel like they could fall out. I got a stuffy nose too so i cant breathe through it at all and that also adding to my tooth and jaw pain. Every time I stand i get short of breath and my body feels heavy and exhausted. My muscles feel soooooo tired even though ive done nothing but lay down. I took tylenol this morning(i think it was expired), and threw that plus everything id drank(just a lot of water) up. That was around 9am and I havent vomited since. I took 6 advil today, 2 every 4 hours but it stopped working after the first time i took it. My bladder also just lets loose whenever I stand up. Im extremely hot but im covered in goosebumps and sometimes i shiver my skin hurts too but that happens almost every single time i get sick.

Advil vomit,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/wgyutl/not_sure_whats_wrong_with_me_mentally_anyone_find/,b'Not sure whats wrong with me mentally. Anyone find themselves getting so distracted?',,"b'Idk whats going on with my brain lately  (Female 25). So Ill start with some background to everything. When I was in highschool I was told I was depressed and had anxiety so that was nothing new. When I started working at a call centre (20) I noticed more than just depression and anxiety. I went and got help which is when I was diagnosed with OCD. I went through so many medications before I found one that worked. Something traumatic happened 2 years later and then I was diagnosed with PTSD as well as panic attack disorder. In high school I was a healthy weight but after the years I gained over 100+ pounds sitting at 261 (22). I decided to come off my medication and started dieting and working out. I lost all the weight and got back down to 145(23) I noticed my mental health was doing great. With covid kicking in things got bad again and I ended up in a psychward. It was the beginning of having memory loss. I asked if it could be adhd distracting me or making me forgetful but they said no. They said it was probably the PTSD. Any how things started to get better except I started having my first aura migraine.(24) The migraines were so intense it caused slurred speach, tingling sensation in half my body, and I would vomit for hours on end crying praying I would die. These attacks crippled me from work and happened once every 3 months. I seen a neurologist and had an mri (I have braces so it blocked a lot of it and said Ill have to re do when braces come off) and basically they told me to take Advil and magnesium and sent me on my merry little way. Now the point for adding all of this in is because Im wondering if my OCD or Migraines could have caused this. So heres what has been happening:\n\nWhen people talk to me Im having a hard time hearing/listening. My boyfriend calls me deaf all the time and says I should get my hearing tested. The thing is, its not that I CANT hear him. If a train is going off in the background or cars are driving by, my brain immediately focuses on that. Its like my brain tunes everything else out including the person talking to me to focus more on the sound in the background. I feel bad because when someone starts talking to me and lets say a washer or dryer is going, I constantly have to keep asking them to repeat themselves and telling them I cant hear them. \nMy dad and brother both have ADHD but I was told I dont have it. Its not that my mind is wondering causing me to day dream while others speak, its just sounds. \nAnother thing that has started up that stresses me out so bad I cry, I cant get any tasks done. My bedroom needs cleaning but everytime I start cleaning it, I find myself doing something else. Example: I started cleaning my room, saw my cat on the bed so I went and patted her. As Im patting her I notice my phone so I pick it up. Next thing you know an hour has gone by and Im watching videos. I catch myself doing that so I put it down and start cleaning again. I run across my boyfriends laptop and now Im on there web browsing and another 20 mins has passed. I once again catch myself and start cleaning my room but found my bible and decided to start reading it. Next thing you know so much time has passed I throw tv on and go to bed. Now my father is upset with me because I was suppose to make some important phone calls for him but didnt make it as I didnt finish my first task of cleaning my room. My room should only take me 10 mins tops to clean but now it has taken me 3 days. All I have to do is empty the room garbage, vacuum, dust, and tidy my desk but it seems so impossible with all these distractions. My OCD has me wanting to clean my room FIRST before doing his task as I like doing things in order.\nMy friends are mad at me because Im constantly late for our hangouts because I go through the same thing. Trying to get ready to leave the house is the worst. I use to be so organized and now I feel like my life is a mess. I now ended up recently losing my job because retaining all the new information is so hard for me. I cant retain information and Im so forgetful now. Idk what to do. My doctor originally blamed ptsd for this but 1000% think it has nothing to do with it as I feel I dont even have ptsd anymore. Could my ocd be causing this? Ive asked about it being adhd but the doctor said if I had it I would have been diagnosed long before now. I feel like my life is being crippled by what ever is happening to me. Not sure if aura migraines can effect the brain. If anyone else has gone through this what helped?'"

clonazepam,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/101ah9n/dealing_with_extreme_social_anxiety/,b'Dealing with extreme social anxiety?',,"b'(25F)\nThroughout my life, I have had trouble with casual parties and family-gatherings. They tend to not only overwhelm me, but also shut me down completely. I cope in those situations with hurting myself lightly, the pain usually distracts me. Things like, scratching to the flesh in one spot for example. \n\nIn Marriages, I tend to simply look for a secluded spot after the initial ceremony and shiver until someone notices me and takes me out of situations. The last time, my mom went to look for me because she knows I have trouble. We went walking and spend 1 hour in a clearing until I had calmed down.\n\nCasual settings like a party between friends can also trigger this extreme response from me, as long as there are 5-6 or more people around me. The most confusing part about it, is that in a work related environment it is a non-issue. There I simply function regardless of how many people I have to deal with.\n\nWhere this extreme response comes from, might be because my father\'s side of the family used to mock and bully me during family-gatherings. Things like calling me good-for-nothing, useless, never achieving anything. I understand that, that is only partly responsible. But I think it played a huge part in my developing child brain and thus now has this complete breakdown in those settings. I feel like someone is going to call me those things at any moment I\'m surrounded by people despite me having completed High-School without even trying, being so good at anything I do, people tend to avoid me when playing with me online.. It led to me having such a high standard for myself, that anything *but* the first place invokes feelings of being not good enough.\n\nIn a game\'s terms; whenever I would end up on 2nd place in a skill based game against other people, I would spend the next 7 days no-lifing the game until I\'d never lose the 1st place ever again.\n\nThat was a lot. Sorry, I didn\'t intend it to encompass half my life\'s story, but I\'m genuinely looking for advice. I can\'t keep going on like this. The feeling of panic and fear I get while being around family and groups of friends is so overwhelmingly negative, I develop bad habits because of it. And the perfectionism it created, left me standing without any friends many times online. Does anyone have any advice? I\'d really welcome it. (I also hope this doesn\'t violate the no medical advice rule. I have aspergers and was thinking there might be people here with similar problems and would like to know how they deal with it.^^"")'"

Advil eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/297vjw/how_to_survive_claravis_isotretinoin_accutane/,"b'[HOW TO] Survive Claravis (Isotretinoin, Accutane)'",,"b'Before I decided to embark on this adventure (yes, it is) I looked across reddit to find information regarding personal experience/ advice/ dos and don\'ts while taking Claravis.  I\'m going to do my best to summarize my experience so far.  I hope that this helps you in making a very important decision.\n\nThe first thing that you **HAVE** to understand is that this is a **FULL TIME COMMITMENT.**  No picking, no alcohol, and hydrate, in that order.  For the last 4+ months I have had to travel everywhere I go with two different tubs of lotion, chapsticks, and a scripted reasoning for why I had to carry around all of this stuff.\n\n***PRODUCTS:*** Tub of Aqaufor for lips, and severely dry skin.  Tub of Cetaphil for dry skin.  I use the body lotion on my face, it was the only thing strong enough to get me through most of the day.  I have chapsticks at my desk at work, two in my car, and at least one in my pocket.  **The first month is crucial: you have to experiment and figure out which brands work for you best.**  I use the girly egg thing from CVS, does wonders.\n\n***WATER:*** You have to hydrate.  If you do not, you will feel groggy and dry.  Not just your skin, but your insides.  Your lungs will feel dry, your blood will feel dry.  Before taking Claravis I drank more water then anyone that I knew.  I\'ve literally doubled my intake, you notice a difference.\n\n***PICKING:*** Claravis gets rid of old skin fast.  If you have a pimple coming in, **LEAVE IT!**  Your skin is so fragile, that when you pick at it, or even pop it, it leaves an enormous crater where the pimple once was and takes days to heal.  The claravis will get rid of the pimple on its own.  If it does not, wait until it is a nice whitehead, take a hot compress and get it soft.  Scrape the whitehead off and push from the inside of your cheek with your tongue to get whatever you can out.  The medicine will handle the rest.\n\n***MOUTH:*** Before bed, I usually shower, put on a fresh coat of lotion, and lather my lips in aquafor.  **ESPECIALLY THE CORNERS OF YOUR MOUTH.**  The most annoying thing by far was in the second month when I didn\'t pay attention to the corners and started playing basketball, sweating, and licking my lips a lot and drying them out.  They crack, turn red, and are impossible to heal.  Almost every hour for the last 2 months I put a fresh coat of aqua on the corner just to keep them wet.  I sleep with an inch of aqua on the corners.  **DONT LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU!**\n\n***NOSE:*** Your nose will be beyond dry.  I have some of the worst allergies my allergist has ever seen.  Years ago, I had sinus surgery to make my breathing bearable.  The dryness will help people with allergies, but using tissues will cause your nose to bleed.  Don\'t expect too many nosebleeds.  I\'ve only had one in four months and it was when I got out of bed.  When I go to sleep, I like to get some aqua up there and keep everything moist.\n\n**EYES:**  Your eyes will get dry.  You will wake up with an enormous amount of ""sleep"" in them and it will be hard to even open them some mornings.  Get a tissue and wipe it out.  If this is really bad you could be getting an ulcer but in my experience, just wipe it out and you will be okay.  Don\'t rub them.  Eyedrops help.\n\n***STOMACH:*** I experienced bad stomach pain early.  I cut out a lot of bad foods, and realized that maybe it was just my diet...I have lost my appetite.  Therefore, I try to make my food intake count and eat healthier things instead of snacks.  Because I lost my 3 meal schedule, I was trying to make up for it by snacking, therefore causing the stomach pain.  Be aware that your appetite can change.\n\n**FATIGUE:** Push yourself to be active.  It will make you want to sit at home and watch movies.  That is all and well, assuming that you have had a productive day.  Get out of the house and get outdoors.  Exercise was difficult to maintain at first.  I used to go to the gym 5 days a week.  Once I started Claravis, I go 7 days and sometimes as early as 6am.  Push yourself and beat the potential side effects.  **They will only effect you if you let them.**  More on this later.\n\n**DRINKING:** You take monthly blood tests to monitor your liver.  I have chosen to not drink while on Claravis.  Some people do.  It\'s your journey.  It can be very dangerous to do so.  More on this later as well.\n\n**DEPRESSION:** I can see how this drug can make you depressed.  I have felt myself becoming more emotional then before taking Claravis.  However, if you are taking it, you hate your skin.  **HOW CAN YOU BE UPSET WHEN YOUR SKIN IS FINALLY CLEAR??!**  If you really do have trouble, don\'t hide it.  I told everyone at work, all of my friends, and generally anyone that asks why I have so much lotion and chapstick with me that I am taking Claravis and have told my coworkers and friends that if they notice any changes, to tell me.  Mood swings happen, and there are days where you just wake up on the wrong side of the bed.  The best thing to do is just get through the day and know that tomorrow will be better.  I haven\'t had two bad days in a row yet.\n\nUnderstand that taking Isotrentinoin is an adventure.  It isn\'t advil, or something that you just have to remember to take and that is it.  It takes over your life.  It is a commitment that you have to work through.  The first month or two is difficult because you are putting all of this work in and not seeing many results.  Eventually your skin clears.  And when it does, you can sit back, relax, and do your routines that you have perfected over the month or so time you have been waiting and experimenting with.  \n\nFigure out what works best for you.  Try something new every day in the first weeks: where you put lotion, where does it help, where does it not get dry.  Everyone is different and the best advice that I can give you is to work hard on making it an easier ride.  There are days where I wont put any lotion on at all and see where I am drying out the most.  \n\nI will offer you a tip that I picked up just to let you know how crazy you are going to get with your routines.  After I shower, I dry my body, then take two separate hand towels.  The first, is to pat my face dry.  I then take a second hand towel and delicately scrape off all of the dead dry skin that I can find.  Why wait for it to peel off when it is just sitting there waiting to peel.  Don\'t push hard, but work some extra stuff off.  \n\nAfter over four months, I have nearly perfect skin.  There is an occasional breakout but by the next day, the medicine takes control and gets rid of it.  It really is amazing to monitor to and watch happen.  Sometimes you will have a large zit brewing, and hours later it is totally gone.  I do not suggest doing this in the winter, as the cold weather will eat at your skin.  And men, shaving is a pain.  \n\n**Use this as an opportunity to better yourself, not just your skin.**  If you aren\'t drinking for 6 months, exercise everyday, eat healthier, and make better decisions.  Be open about your medicine, and talk to people about it.  The worst thing that you can do it keep it a secret.  I think that that leads to depression.\n\nTaking my pill every morning and night doesnt even feel like it is for my skin.  I almost feel like it a reminder to be a better person, and to treat my body better.  The skin clearing up has become a secondary perk.  Six months is a LONG time.  I\'m not even done with what I signed up for but I couldn\'t be happier with my decision.\n\nAny and all questions are welcome.  None to big, and none to small.  Happy to help.  Expect updates as I continue my adventure.\n\nEDIT: Officially done with my 5 month dose. It\'s been three full days, and I am still dry, if not more than before...could be explained by the weather or an outside factor.  So far so good!'"

Sorry about this post but I need to tell it somewhere because I think it can help me.\nI am 18. Since I can remember Ive been struggling with things in my life. I was always a weird kid, I had friends and I have a good contact with them till now I do not have problems talking with people most of the time. But I am weird. At least that is what people say. But Id like to start from the beginning I think. \nSo back in the early days of high school I was a very very quiet kid. But not shy. Ive always loved talking about useles stuff with people. Nothing that would make me friends with them but more like weird things. I am not sure how it looked back then because I cannot remember but that is how I felt. Ive been suicidal. I am not sure how much or even if that was real. Ive been listening to Kurt cobein sometimes I talked about this stuff and it might be weird to other. Basically a depressed teenager. Nothing special. During this time I think I started or just I am not able to remember stuff that now seems odd. Like being obsessed with friends. Like sometimes I was really paranoid with them like why they do not like me and they are not taking me with them. This are some old memories from this times. Other memories just vanished. Like I cant really remember what I was doing then. Only a few girls who I had crush on and it was odd also. Ive always thought to myself that it is just teenage stuff or maybe slight depression that I can cope with. I tried to consume as much information on this as possible. Like Ted talks about stuff like that and other things. I wanted to know what is going on. I did not thought to go to a therapist at all.\nFew years later i catches a feeling to my friend that I have been friends since childhood. I thought nothing special just awkward kid who cannot really do social interactions very well. Once I told her in a weird way that Id like to be her boyfriend. She reacted weirdly. She rejected me and she was trying to be nice. And I was living my life just fine. But since she was and she still is my friend we were doing stuff together. I promise I am getting to the point here. So she was acting like once she is interested in me like talking nice stuff and saying things that I should stay with her or sth. 6 months after that she actually invited me on a date I think. We went on a walk 2 times. I think I was acting totally fine. Like talking about Norma stuff nothing weird I promise. I was just happy that she wanted to meet me. After that she didnt want to go out with me anymore. Nothing special that how it works I think. And from there I started to losing my mind. Like firstly I was fine but it looked like at least for me , I really tried to move on but I couldnt, that she feels something towards me. And I wasnt able to think straight. I was literally obsessed with her. Not in any creepy way. Like she was always on my mind. After almost every drink that I had I was crying. Especially when she was around. My mood was really really bad when it looked like she doesnt like me or very good when suddenly it looked like it is the other way. I know it sounds weird like hell. But I promise I felt this too. I just couldnt stop it. Having mental breakdowns cutting myself and once even talking to me if the cut would be deep enough that I can bleed out I wont do anything about it Id like to die. This thought were always there. I can remember that few years back I was standing in the kitchen with a knife to my wrests but this was like coping mechanisms for me. I am not sure if I would be ever able to do that. And now 1 and a half year after all this with her started I still am dependent on her. I was doing lsd few times. Tried codeine a few times. I was drinking a lot. I can call myself a reckless driver. I have a really big mood swings. I am able to get up from bed and be like wowow what am I doing this is crazy let gets something done and I fell fucking grwat. Or if I text someone or her and a conversation goes in a certain seat that makes me feel better it changes my day like 190 degrees. But there are days that I am not able to do stuff like I am crying and I think about suicdie and her and aaaah isnt frustrating. In this point I am not sure if this is about her because I think I had this feeling about other girls. This weird obsession. Mood swings dependent on stuff that is going on with relations with other people. Ive been to a psychologist once and I told him what I was feeling in that exact moment but I feel like it was just a glimpse of what I felt there and then. Sometimes I feel like talking to someone or going on a ride or changing a room or going out could make me a really happy person but getting back to my room is bad almost always. The doctor said I should find somebody that tests people with autism spectrum that are adults because he things it might be a problem and since then I think there are things that make me think about stuff different then others  and there is that thing when even little noises could make me really really frustrated but I do not know what to do. I just feel bad . I do not want to write anymore because nobody will probably read that so if you did thanks you can let me know what so you think about me and tell me something nice. Love you'"

I believe it works pretty effectively even on the small 0.25mg dosage Im on\n\n* Escitalopram 10mg\n\n  * I believe I was prescribed the for anxiety and depression and this should take 4-8 weeks to kick in (I\'m about 2 and a half weeks into this)\n\nFor ADHD:\n\n* Adderall XR 10mg\n\n  * I believe I was prescribed this for the adhd (they say the plan is to increase this every 2 weeks until I get the desired effect). So far I think it *might* be helping??? but its too close to placebo to call effective. I have noticed feeling less hungry though, which is great.\n\n---\n\nOk, context out of the way, what are my fears?\n\nThe recommended instructions for Clonazepam say to take 2 per day as needed (which I assume to mean that I don\'t take it on days I am not in anxiety filled situations. The psychiatrist said they expect Ill take one a day in the morning (where I said the most anxiety comes usually from a scheduled work meeting).\n\nThe last weekend I did so anyways, but this weekend did not.\n\nThis monday morning early morning like 3AM (I didn\'t really get much sleep so this is when I woke up), I felt fucking awful. Like I lay there anxious as I\'ve ever been with no particular thoughts about anything anxiety inducing in particular but just kept thinking ""I should just fucking kill myself and be done with it"" and dreaming of the blissful lack of pain/fade to white and then nothing at the end of jumping off a tall building.\n\nThe whole time I realized this was super unhealthy and uncharacteristically strong. Like for the past ... over a decade of my life I have generally been depressed and thought casually , but never with strong emotion about it, and I still maintain that my plan is to only see it as an option when my options for trying to treat it seem like they are running out (in practical terms meaning that after I\'ve tried with at least one more psychiatrist if this doesn\'t work out, gotten a psychologist I vibe with this psychiatrist etc) I would throw in the towel.\n\nAnyhow my point here is, for around 2 weeks I have been much less anxiety filled and have had a much less depressed mood than normal with hope for my future given the positive effects I had seen with both the Adderall and Clonazepam. I don\'t feel like I was actually at any danger of killing myself, but the emotion to do so so suddenly despite my the previous 2 weeks or so of a heightened mood has me worried about my medications.\n\nIs it the Escitalopram with the rare side effects of suicide ideation or is it my not taking clonazepam for one day? \n I knew clonazepam built up dependency, but is it that quickly??? \n\nI don\'t know the answers to any of those, but it was genuinely extremely scary. Like someone had pointed a depression/anxiety-anator at my head and pulled the trigger.\n\nHas anyone experienced anything like this?\n\nI think I\'m going to continue taking everything as prescribed every day, and bring this up with my psychiatrist when I meet them again next week, but I thought Id leave this here with the hopes to get some opinions, thoughts, and potentially some information for anyone who runs into my situation in the future and wonders if they are alone in this.\n\n---\n\nExtra details: late 20s, male, bmi 35'"

I waited another 2 weeks in this pain before I traveled across state lines for the holidays & my mom insisted I go to a doctor because the pain and swelling was unbearable, expanding into my back. I was rushed to the hospital and spent a week there. Thank God the clot did not travel into my heart, lungs, or brain. They were able to bust it. Due to a venous abnormality in my abdomen and my sedentary lifestyle (I use a wheelchair), they put me on warfarin - which I was on for years -  but now have been on Xerelto 20mg/daily for 6 or so years.\n\nWhen I survived this, anxiety and depression hit - and hard. I was scared of getting a clot. I was scared of an internal bleed. I was scared of a brain aneurysm, a heart attack - everything. Was my blood still to thick? Was it too thin? I have been somewhat successful in keeping it at bay through SSRI & SNRI medication, some therapy, getting started with meditation & acupuncture.

It is embarrassing, it is frustrating, and it seems like it is never going to go away. While we may be able to control some of it depending on what we eat and what our stress levels are like, sometimes breakouts can appear without any warning. Luckily, there are many natural ingredients like Aloe Vera, which can help you reduce your breakouts and cure your acne-prone skin.\n\n## [Aloe Vera for Acne](https://biocule.com/bioedge/research/aloe-barbadensis-leaf-juice)\n\nAloe vera is a natural anti-inflammatory that can help reduce red marks left on the skin by acne. Aloe vera contains lignin, which improves the skin's ability to hydrate itself, promoting cell turnover and healthy tissue growth. Aloe vera also contains salicylic acid, which helps clear dead skin cells that clog pores.\n\nAcne scars will fade in time, but aloe vera may help speed up the process. The anti-inflammatory properties of [aloe vera for acne scars](https://biocule.com/bioedge/research/aloe-barbadensis-leaf-juice) reduce swelling and redness, while its antimicrobial properties kill bacteria that may be contributing to the infection of individual pimples as well as breakouts as a whole.\n\n## [How to Use Aloe Vera for Acne Scars?](https://biocule.com/bioedge/research/aloe-barbadensis-leaf-juice)\n\n**Apply Aloe Vera Directly on Acne Scars -** Extract fresh aloe vera gel from a leaf of the aloe vera plant and apply directly to the affected area. Leave it on for half an hour, then wash the gel off with water. Pat your face dry and apply a moisturizer to hydrate your skin. Repeat this twice daily for best results.\n\n**Aloe Vera Mask -** Squeeze half a lemon into a bowl. Add two tablespoons of aloe vera gel and one tablespoon of cinnamon powder to it. Mix it together to make a paste and apply it evenly to your face. Leave it for 20 minutes and wash it off with water.\n\nYou can also use honey and aloe vera. Honey is a natural antiseptic that helps in healing acne scars while cinnamon has anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce the appearance of scars."""

For about 10 years, my internist had prescribed Dexilant for me for significant GERD even though I've had the WLS. I was symptom-free as long as I was religious with my Dexilant, taken at night. When the surgeon who does my ablations found out I'd been on Dexilant for so long, he blanched and told me to stop immediately. He prescribed lansoprazole 30mg daily, Famotidine 40 mg every night, and Gaviscon for breakthroughs. It is not working, I still suffer from pretty bad GERD. Why was the long-term use of Dexilant so bad? In your practice/experience, what other options are available? My diet is pretty standard post-WLS--high protein, low carb/low sugar. I do drink tea or coffee with cream every day, and wine occasionally though I can't track either of those to my GERD. Thank you in advance."""

Advil problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/mtysor/i_think_im_trying_to_kill_myself_through/,"b""I think I'm trying to kill myself through self-sabotage.""",,"b'Let me start off by stating I (M26, AA) have been recently diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Diagnosis came in 2019 and was previously misdiagnosed as ADHD, as common with many Black children. I\'ve tried meds, most recently last week, though we only recently go the dosage right to give me the perfect balance of productivity and mood control. Then my psychiatrist retired and my therapist shortly after due to COVID. I essentially have to start from scratch and I just took my last pill last week.\n\nRegardless of these facts I\'ve been extremely high functioning my entire life. Juggling multiple extra-curricular activities in high school, etc. Even now, I work full time (Financial Consultant), an studying full time (MA in Econ/MSc in IT), and juggle two businesses I both found and run. Though sometimes I get run down and let these things all falter at once even knowing I have the capability to juggle them all. I think I try to induce stressors in these areas because I end up producing some of my best work in pressure-based environments.\n\nRecently, my (26F) long distance fianc has been drinking more, going out bar hopping ""alone"" on the weekends, not answering her phone and generally ghosting at night. When confronted about it she outright refuses to give me an explanation in defiance. Suggesting that I\'m being annoying or needy to even ask. We had been talking about me tailing a trip to Houston to love and work with her for a few weeks to a month just to rekindle things but she backs out and ghosts me again every-time it\'s the day of. This has been going on since mid-February. It is now Mid-April. I think she\'s cheating but I just make an effort to try and believe what she tells me and leave it to her conscious (if she has one) to sort the rest out. It got so bad that she blocked me completely from everything with no explanation for 24 hours and I felt so down about myself that I wrote a suicide note with my Will included for my family to find in case I needed it. Downed a bottle of Red wine and a few Advil PMs hoping I wouldn\'t wake up. I ended up calling the suicide hotline twice that night (they were no help btw). She answered finally after I bugged her to death the next day and I had hope that things were resolved (I was delusional). \n\nIn addition to my girl problems, I have been waiting 18 months for a promotion at my company that I was previously granted. Some loophole in our company policy blocked me from being about to take the position until March of 2021 (Hired Sept 2019, Promoted Dec 2019). Due to COVID we now work permanently from home. Just last week I interviewed for the position again as a formality as it was suggested that I pretty much already had the gig. This was the same day I was pleading for my fianc to unblock me and give me some explanation. She eventually did later that day as I mentioned but my head was all over the place  going into the interview. I got news on Friday that they went with another candidate and I\'m starting now to feel as if there is a larger motive by my bosses to keep my undervalued and underpaid. My current job requires no degree, no certs, and 1 years financial exp. I have 2 bachelor\'s degrees in related fields, my Series 7 and 63, and minimum 5 years experience.\n\nNeedless to say these things combined with running out of meds, among other things that are too long to explain, have caused me to break down and start making drastic decisions. I work first thing Monday morning but I packed two bags, all of my work equipment, and drove 12 hours to Houston to surprise my fianc, only to find that she isn\'t where she said she would be. I know form experience I won\'t get ahold of her in time to set up my equipment at her place, clock in, and complete my shift. I risked my job for this trip and it\'s the dumbest thing I\'ve done so far this decade. And I did it off of an impulsive decision and blind trust in my woman. Or was it self sabotage? \n\nI\'m now considering leaving my job cold turkey before they can follow me, breaking the engagement off with my fianc, spending the engagement ring money on a well-deserved two week vacation out of the country (first time, am vaccinated), and coming back to start my own practice, focus on my businesses, and finish my studies. It sounds wonderful in my head but I can\'t decide if these thoughts are a result of me just wanting more for myself out of life, or if it is self sabotage and I\'m purposefully derailing my life out of self-hate and depression as a result of my disorder. The worst part is that I\'m also afraid that I may be subconsciously pushing myself to my own suicide on foreign land. Or doing impulsive things and hoping as a result I die as a result of my own reckless behavior. This wouldn\'t be the first time and I desperately want to believe that I am making the right set of decisions. \n\nPlease advise. I think I\'m going to go off the deep end if I don\'t find some kind of solace.'"

As a kid it never actually affected me (we have had cats my whole life up until Sept 2019) but over the years it got worse. If I was cuddling/patting my cat and I hadn't taken an antihistamine that day, I would slowly develop swollen, super itchy, watery eyes and a splotchy red rash on my face/neck - but when this happened I would take an antihistamine and the reaction would calm down soon enough. Ever since losing our last cat in September 2019, my allergy has got worse and antihistamines don't help any more. Any time I am around someone else's cat and I'm interacting with it in some way, after 40mins-1hr my eyes start getting itchy and swelling up.  I've recently had to switch to extra strength telfast pills + corticosteroid nose spray + allergy eye drops every day (my usual loratadine pills weren't cutting it anymore because it's been a VERY bad hayfever season where I live). I thought being on stronger antihistamines (and taking them religiously every day) would make me less sensitive to cats but I still get the same reaction. It seems like my body was more desensitized to cats when I had one and was around them every day, but now I haven't been living with any cats for a while, I've become super sensitized to it. It's like the antihistamines don't even make a difference to my cat allergy anymore. This is pretty gutting for me as my family would like to get another cat but I actually don't think I would be able to cope with my allergies. Is desensitization therapy my only route here? Is there anything else that has helped anyone with cat allergies? Life isn't fair when you're a huge animal lover with a cat allergy lol"""

The only reason for the APS diagnosis was extremely low  platelets (6k), APS antiboides, triple positive, and the fact that a  platelet infusion only brought them to 8k. I responded great with dexa  (x5 days) and predinsone (3 months) with Cellcept (MMF) which I\'m still  taking (2g/day). I also take a bunch of other medications (baby aspirin,  vit D, fenofibrate for triglycerides, which caused the pancreatitis  (2900+), and some psych meds: wellbutrin, pregabalin, clonazepam,  desvenlafaxine, and Ubiquinol and pre-probiotics as supplements). No  clots so far.\n\nThe problem is, I\'ve  felt cold (a sensation which starts as regular coldness and then turns  into some weird sensation which seems unbearable) in my head, face and  arms for about 3 months now. It didn\'t coincide with any addition or  substraction of any meds or supplements. No hypothyroidism, all tested  electrolytes in normal range, not anemic. Vit D normal levels now.\n\nI  don\'t know whether the main cause is psychriatic (anxiety/depression?),  metabolic (recent prediabetes diagnosis, on metformin now, though this  happened after the coldness started) or nervous system related (no  idea), or something else.\n\nI used  to smoke 15-20 cigs a day (I stopped for a year and am now at 4-5, but I  do vape a lot). I\'m obese (BMI 29-31), I walk 5000 ish steps a day  (some way more, some way less). My mother and sister have Lupus and  fibromyalgia, and my uncle had RA.\n\nThis  feeling of coldness begins whenever I wake up, (9-11am, sometimes 2 or 3  pm) until like 6 or 8 hours later. If I don\'t take or do anything, it  is literally unbearable and prevents from working, studying,  socializing, etc. However, both exercise and/or high doses of pregabalin  (300-450mg) plus clonazepam (3-6 drops) reduce it.

However I was instructed not to consume any alcohol bc of the  triglyceridemia. And I also don\'t want to become addicted to alcohol.\n\nAnyway,  my rheumathologist and psychiatrist think it might be some sort of  dysautonomia (I have no other symptomts of POTS, dysautonomia or CFS, I  did have fatigue but resolved with wellbutrin).\n\nMy  endocrinologist thinks it is because I have hypothyroidism (only because of positive and high TPO antibodies and borderline low T3, and  symptoms, even though thyroid US came back normal).\n\nI  think it might be related to brown fat; different types of cortisol  released while/after eating, or something else related to tissue  metabolism. Perhaps low T3 (I know it has no official diagnostic value).  I have noticed that both my face and scalp get hotter when I feel cold,  to the point where I get a low fever reading with my laser thermometer  even though I get a 36.4-36.6 reading with the armpit one.\n\nThis  sensation is horrible and is making me not want to do anything other  than vegetate for the firs half of each day. I\'ve tried Vitamin B1/6/12  supplements for a month without result. What else could it be??? Does it  have a ""solution"" in case it is some sort of very weird dysautonomia?  what is the next step after taking levothyroxine if it doesn\'t solve it  (and it turns out I don\'t actually have HT?\n\nCould it be low testosterone, or some sort of medication interaction which caused the symptom months after taking said meds?\n\nI\'m at a loss and pretty much want to go to sleep and not wake up every night. I don\'t think any doctor I\'ve seen truely understands how annoying/disabilitating this is. Thank you!'"

To fix this I was prescribed hydrocortisone cream (a steroid cream) to use for a week. I did so and the problem was sorted and my eczema completely disappeared for the most part.\n\nHowever, around a year ago (August 2021) I noticed it coming back, with my eyes being by far the worst. I knew hydrocortisone had worked before so I bought myself some. It worked after using it for a week however eczema kept coming back. Against my better judgment and rather stupidly, I ended up using hydrocortisone cream on the area around my eyes on and off for around 8-9 months - basically enough time to become addicted and reliant on the cream.\n\nIt was near the end of April 2022 that I decided to stop using the cream completely. For around 2 months I weened myself off the cream, dealing with some pretty rough side effects of corticosteroid withdrawal (dry eyes, rough skin, swelling). I have been 100% steroid free since July (around 3 months) and I am mostly happy with my eyes. My eczema has gone and all the painful/really bad side effects are gone.\n\nHowever, now I am dealing with redness around my eyelids, sometimes mild swelling (which goes away after applying a cold cloth or dunking my face in cold water, etc.) and the skin is rather sensitive and sometimes dry. I acknowledge I have damaged the skin around my eyes and will have to deal with that for a while however some days it is almost unnoticeable so I know I can eventually recover fully.\n\nI currently use a range of soothing eye ointments (hydrosil dry eye gel is one that has been particularly helpful) that I carry with me however these only do so much. I also notice that a piroten or Benadryl can help with the appearance of the skin (don't know if that information helps but trying to paint a full picture).\n\nThis is not an urgent issue and is definitely livable as I am no longer reliant on the steroid cream and most days it is not that noticeable (I also wear glasses most of the time which helps appearance-wise) but it is something I would ideally like to move past. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks :)"""

But, when I got home I did not feel right I just felt foggy and disconnected from my emotions and the things around me  I also had a pretty bad headache as well. I initially wrote all of this off because, I had just been given anesthesia and had a tooth pulled out so I wrote all this off. fast forward a week or so and I felt a little less foggy but I still felt disconnected but not as much as before I also started to have deep feelings of dread and depression type symptoms like complete loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping, and most troubling anhedonia which had been there since the surgery. As of now things have gotten slightly better I have don't really have as many feelings of dread or a complete loss of appetite but I still feel disconnected from my my emotions and reality and my anhedonia has improved slightly but is still there. I initially thought this was caused by the anesthesia (Propofol) but, I also feel like my jaw doesn't sit right although I have no pain in my mouth or teeth. I have been to the dentist and had a x-ray but they said it looked ok and there should not be any nerve damage. I also went to the doctor and had a blood test but they said there were no deficiencies and that I seemed pretty healthy.

I originally thought it was simply due to stress, by January of 2020 it got so severe I could no longer open my mouth and my diet turned to a lovely diet of liquids. I saw a regular dentist who tried a steroid pack along with cyclobenzaprine, that failed and he sent my on my way to physical therapy and a specialist. The specialist had a custom made mouth guard made for me and continued me on the cyclobenzaprine, along with diagnosing me with Disk Displacement without reduction on the left and with reduction on the right. \n\nPhysical therapy lasted for a few months and saw minimal improvement, the same with the medication and the mouth guard. We were able to increase my opening to around 25 mm, and the specialist also at that time told me that he didn't notice any of the typical signs of grinding or clenching, teeth were all in good shape, no cavities. I eventually started to degrade in condition and was later sent for a CT scan with nothing being seen out of the ordinary beside enlarged lymph nodes that on an MRI appeared to have gone back to normal. The specialist didn't know what else to do as I was at the point where I had an opening of less than 10 mm, so he sent me to an oral surgeon.\n\nThe oral surgeon said that because there was no proof of anything of the scan he wouldn't do anything, so I went to my normal doctor to see if they could send me to pain management to deal with the pain, my doctor also switched me to tizanidine and diclofenac to see if that could help. It hasn't.\n\nMy pain management doctor is now doing steroid injections into the joint to see how they work, so far there's been no improvement and my primary doctor is now beginning to be concerned due to my increasing loss in weight and dropping blood pressure which has been caused by not being able to eat much or drink.\n\nI don't know what to do, I've tried so many conservative treatments, but everything feels like it's been failing.

I have a weird fethis and that is dying by liver/oran failure generally anything that injure me turn me on. I also get turned on by dying in medical seting. When I was 15 I started to imagine myself getting liver failure or organ failure and strangely getting turned on by it. This is important for later, but this fethis was just a phase.  This is extremly weird I know, but I have always known there is something very wrong with me. I have aspergers, but i think i have some underlying mental condition. I Love being being wreckless, I set fire to stuff and get into huge fist fights outnumbered often losing. I am 19 and estimate I have been in 40+ fights. I have even been stabbed with a bottle once. I feel euphoric when i do it. Often after fist fights I masturbate because of the pure euphoria. I feel mentally very ill at times because I get sexually turned on by the weirdest stuff. Since May 2018 I have ran oral steroids which I bough from my drug dealer and bying them from the internett. The reason for running them was because I wanted to get big and muscular, because I have serious body image issues also i binge eat alot so i didnt wanna get fat, the binge eating would make me big. I started to run ran 50mg dianabol everyday. After 5 months i started to feel sick every morning and i puked alot of my food up. I reckoned this was my liver acting up, but the fucked up thing is when i recognized this the memories from being fifteen started to come back and lets say i Felt turned on all the time.\n\n I ran the Dianabol for 1 month more before I stopped it. I later went on a 2 month drug binge where I did alot pills and cocaine. In december I decided to run Trenavar at 120mg stacked with epistane 50mg every day. For the sole intention of getting big for attention, and to try and kill myself with liver failure because at this point i am very depressed and I just wanna die. I drank alot of alcohol when i was running this stack mainly because i wanted to escape and to kill myself. I drank maybe a six pack 3 times a week. After about 2 months of abusing my body for no reason other than getting turned on I started to abuse OTC codein which has paracetamol in it. This is where it became to much for me. After a 8 day binge i started to get pain in my liver. I could actually feel my liver when walking and working out. I started to feel dizzy. I stopped drinking and halfed my steroid dose. I Started to feel better after about 1 weeks and i kept running my stack. \n\nThen one fatefull saturday i was invited to a party, I never get invited to parties, because everyone deems me weird. I had to go. When I was at the party I drank extremly heavly over 0.5 liters of vodka and snorted alot of cocaine. The next morning i had pain where my kidnes where and when i peed the pee was black. I was in dire pain . I started to regret what i had done with my body. I had pain in my kidnes and a weird tingling sensastion in my stomach for 2 weeks. I Wanted to kill myself in this time period but i couldn't go through with it. I still felt turned on by damaging my liver and organs, but i was still extremly worried that i might have permantly injured myself so i stopped all alcohol and steroids. I waited intuil july 2019 when i went back on trendione at 90mg everyday. I Did this because I didnt want to loose my size.  It went only 6 days before i started to shit blood. and after 10 days i had dire pain in my liver. I stopped everything. Its august now and i am starting my apprentice job soon, but i feel like i have a foot in the grave. I have serious pain in my liver and my stomach is bloated. I have indigisten and i itch everywhere, but i get turned on by this knowning that i am in dire shit. I wonder what is wrong with me why i keep killingmyself and why i cant get turned on by women or men, but by objects and injuring myself. I also cut myself. I am scared of going to the doctors because then i have to admit what i have done and they will know that i am a drug abuser. \n\nCan someone also talk to me. I am very lonley at the moment. I am also in alot of pain"""
hydrochlorothiazide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/9q0jys/antipsychotics_and_antidepressants/,b'ANTIPSYCHOTICS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS',,"b'**I am searching for individuals in Canada who have experienced the same debilitating side effects and withdrawal effects from being prescribed antipsychotic mediations and other psychotropic medications with the intentions of approaching CBC to propose an investigation into the complacent prescribing of these medications and the destructive aftermath of taking these medications.**\n\n**The text below is a ""condensed"" letter I wrote to the Canadian Association of Mental Health (and others) describing my disturbing, perpetual ""journey"" on psychotropic medications.**\n\n**The complaint process was difficult in that I had not completely discontinued all psychotropic medications and was ""scattered"" missing an opportunity to address additional concerns regarding the prescribing psychiatrist. As psychiatric patients, we are often psychologically and physically vulnerable to the medications we are prescribed and the assumption is that we will be taking psychotropic medications for a lifetime and will never be ""cured"".**\n\n**Respectfully, as a woman who works in health care, I know that there is a population of individuals that benefit from these medications and will have to take psychotropic medications for their lifetime. Please understand that I am not critical or judgemental of these healthcare scenarios.**\n\nThe purpose in sharing the exhausting, and often consuming, chemical psychotropic medication cycle that affected my reality is to highlight the consequences of mechanically prescribing psychotropic medications, such as Risperidone, and the associated, and often disconcerting symptoms patients experience when these medications are changed or discontinued. Ill advised, I found myself running from one medication to another with the development of each new and troubling symptom contributing to increased physical and emotional discord. My quest for answers was frantic as my body and mind failed me. To my detriment, this franticness was witnessed by the prescribing psychiatrist and a host of other healthcare professionals leaving a permanent impression of madness that is not easily erased.\n\nListening to CBC radio and reviewing this conversation online provided links to numerous studies conducted and documented by reputable sources confirming my initial belief that many of the physical and psychological symptoms I endured over a 5 year period were primarily from psychotropic medication dosage changes, switching from one medication to another, discontinuing these medications completely and the painful emotions from having many of my concerns dismissed with condescension and evident irritability within a small healthcare community. I would find myself being labeled as a difficult patient and diagnosed with numerous psychiatric syndromes I had never been associated with in the past.\n\nI have a history of an eating disorder decades ago and received treatment at the Toronto General Hospital for 14 weeks beginning in January 1988. I experienced decreased, yet intermittent binging after receiving care at Toronto General Hospital. I found myself moving to a smaller city to be closer to my distant father in September 2003 and obtained an unreliable casual cashier position at a local hardware store. I arrived with a small supply of the antidepressant Prozac and considered discontinuing this medication when the supply was exhausted. My attempt to discontinue Prozac was unsuccessful and I was referred to a psychiatrist in March 2004.\n\nThe prescribing psychiatrist has a private psychiatric practice with full privileges at the local hospital, staffs an outpatient rapid response clinic and is also a clinical assistant professor specializing in mood and anxiety disorders at a reputable university typicalling seeing approximately 700 patients per year since 1997. These credentials suggest a mental health care professional with significant knowledge of the vast and diverse psychotropic medications he prescribes to hundreds of his patients on day to day basis.\n\nI was prescribed a different antidepressant in March 2004 that was later determined ineffective and replaced with the familiar Prozac in August 2004. I was then prescribed Risperidone in September 2004 to augment the Prozac for depression. I was not aware that benefits of Prozac required time to be achieved. I returned to this psychiatrists office requesting higher and higher doses of Risperidone on three separate occasions specifically for this medications sedating properties and I was never advised of the potential irreversible side effects of Risperidone and the difficulty discontinuing this medication when this medication was first initiated and with each subsequent requested dosage increase. \n\nLiterature reports that many patients will not experience the full benefit of antidepressants therapy immediately and the benefits may take as long as 8 weeks. Perhaps Risperidone would never have been prescribed had I waited the course till the full benefits of Prozac therapy were achieved; and, conceivably, I could still be taking Prozac today. \n\nI addressed my concerns about taking Risperidone with the prescribing psychiatrist in April 2008 when I discovered this medication was utilized as a chemical restraint in the elderly population with dementia often presenting with difficult behaviours. I did not want to take Risperidone after this discovery yet believed the prescribing psychiatrist--a paternal-like figure--must know best. I was both shy and timid when addressing my concerns about taking Risperidone only to end up being in agreement with current psychotropics or advised to trial another antipsychotic such as Invega. I opted not to trial Invega. I felt the onus of seeking alternatives to Risperidone fall upon my shoulders and my role in health care was insignificant when compared to the role of psychiatrist. I felt very unsupported.\n\nA typical prescription would read Prozac 80-120mg and Risperdal 2-4mg or simply Prozac 120mg and Risperdal 4mg. The prescribing psychiatrist documented that I often reduced both medications and, at one time, reduced the Prozac dosage as low a 20mg documenting relapse without ever investigating the purpose of my non-compliance. In addition, my medical charts reveal that a pharmacy had contacted the prescribing psychiatrist asking if they should fill an expired prescription for Risperidone and Prozac as I had reported having accumulated a surplus of medication. The prescription was filled and the prescriber made no inquiry into the surplus or stockpile of medication I had acquired or the notion of noncompliance. This lack of inquiry hindered the development of a therapeutic relationship that was never really initiated. \n\nThe antipsychotic medications began to change in late 2012: from Risperidone to Quetiapine, back to Risperidone *and* Quetiapine, to Trazodone, to Trazodone and Quetiapine and this chemical psychotropic medication cycle would continue to negatively affect my physical and psychological wellness in such profound ways leading me to believe that other psychotropic medications were ineffective contributing to increased medication changes perpetuating physical harm and psychological chaos for several years to follow. Unbeknownst to me, I would begin an era fraught with somatic symptoms including increased body pain query fibromyalgia, fatigue, skin rashes, gastrointestinal issues query irritable bowel syndrome, nausea, numbness and tingling, cognitive decline, increased anxiety (GAD), ADHD, fatigue and insomnia coupled with numerous psychiatric labels that I can not seem to escape. The newly acquired psychiatric labels assigned to me based upon the symptoms I presented with were perhaps the most harmful and destructive eroding my self- esteem and self-confidence in tasks that I had become proficient in.\n\nInsomnia developed when Quetiapine replaced Risperidone and I began to struggle with the demands of shift work where I was required to work within a team environment in a role to care for others. I would later return to the more powerful Risperidone. The prescribing psychiatrist documents in my medical charts that I did not find the Seroquel as helpful as the Risperdal, and decided to go back on the Risperdal, in addition to continuing on the Seroquel. She was aware of the increased risk of TD \\[Tardive Dyskinesia\\] by making the decision to go back on the Risperdal, in comparison to remaining solely on Seroquel. The irony in this statement is that I would not have found myself in that uncomfortable predicament of having to choose between one antipsychotic over another antipsychotic--Risperidone or Seroquel--had the prescribing psychiatrist obtained valid informed consent when the medication was initiated in September 2004. I propose this example of thorough documentation of informed consent is to avoid blame or responsibility for the prescribing psychiatrists failure to obtain informed consent when initially prescribing Risperidone and with subsequent dosage increases in the past.\n\nIn addition, I had to have older breast implants removed at the hospital I was employed at in 2013 and anticipated discontinuing Risperidone close to the surgery date. I was quite content with my body image in my early 50s and opted for a simple explantation without additional cosmetic surgery and I had established very satisfying and financially rewarding employment allowing me to reduce my mortgage significantly.\n\nThe unexpected and coincidental removal of ruptured and encapsulated silicone breast implants in 2013 coupled with the current-day controversy surrounding silicone breast implants at that time contributed to an even greater sense of confusion within me as I began to experience the host of challenging physical and psychological symptoms . There is a specific group of individuals consisting primarily or women who believe that silicone breast implants and silicone products are harmful and contribute to numerous physical and psychological health concerns including breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma. \n\nI knew enough to recognize the onset of the symptoms I experienced presented quickly but I could not determine if the symptoms were from psychotropic medication changes, psychotropic medication discontinuation or from 28 year old ruptured silicone breast implants. I was confused and with increased anxiety I asked the prescribing psychiatrist if any of my pain could be contributed to various psychotropic medications and their corresponding changes. His response was Not to my knowledge. There is sufficient documentation regarding the onset of the physical and psychological symptoms experienced in my medical notes from my local walk-in medical clinic; a medical clinic that would abruptly dismiss my concerns only to discover that genuine health concerns existed. I vividly recall a physician in this medical clinic, with great annoyance, attempt to convince me that I had a complex chronic disease by utilizing a tick-in-the-box symptom checker sheet.\n\nLoss of respect and faith in this medical clinic eventually replaced the painful feelings of being identified as a difficult and undesirable patient. \n\nMy coping skills diminished quickly with the numerous psychotropic medication changes originating from a conscious and documented attempt to discontinue Risperidone in 2012 leading me to believe that the Prozac I had taken since the late 1998 was no longer effective. I inquired about the efficacy of Prozac when taken for extended periods of time and the prescriber psychiatrist could not comment so I requested to switch to another antidepressant in April 2014. My ability to concentrate at work declined significantly as I began to soil myself with increasing frequency and I felt I had to transfer from an acute care position consisting of shiftwork that I truly loved to a disappointing and unsupportive part time position is residential care due to the unpredictability of my bowels. I was overwhelmed when, to use medical terminology, I was incontinent of a large loose, liquid BM in Walmart. This fecal incontinence affected my ability to manage at work and in daily life and I sought more frequent psychiatric counsel. The prescribing psychiatrist was unable to connect the increased loose fecal incontinence I experienced with the medication he prescribed in April 2014 until late August 2014. The prescribing psychiatrist suggested I consider the plant-based Vegan diet and implied that the aging process may be contributing to my physical symptoms. These symptoms exacerbated any mood disorder I may have had contributing to increased anxiety, depression and isolation coupled with feelings complete helplessness.\n\nThe prescribing psychiatrist did not consider a differential diagnosis and review the various psychotropic medication changes prescribed, beginning with Risperidone, as potential sources to the numerous side effects presented. I would learn years later that the medication causing fecal incontinence prescribed in April 2014 had been prescribed and deemed ineffective a decade earlier in 2004 and the prescribing psychiatrist neglected to refer to my medical charts when inadvertently re-prescribing this medication for a second time. \n\nI was very afraid as my mind and body began to fail me. The physical and psychological symptoms escalated and I called 811 in August 2014 and was advised to go to the emergency department in the hospital where I work. Emergency physicians often refer to a medication databank listing the patients dispensed medications to develop an understanding into the patients medical history and to gain potential insight into the cause of patients primary complaint leading to an emergency visit. My medication databank (Pharmanet) listed numerous and various psychotropic medications dispensed over several months and I was hurt to hear the emergency physician state that I was wasting his time during this isolated visit in August 2014. Thoughtless and disparaging comments and attitudes towards individuals with mental illness are common in the healthcare profession; a profession that should display more tolerance towards individuals with mental illness. Individuals holding positions of authority in healthcare should choose to be positive role models for others and lead by example. The emergency physicians statement clearly implied I was a burden and this notion would be reinforced by health care professionals in my community for years to come serving to exacerbate any struggles I may have had with depression and anxiety.\n\nI have been privy to many conversations regarding challenging patients and I regretfully admit to participating in some of these conversations. I distinctly recall caring for two women known throughout the healthcare facility as being demanding and unreasonable and it became difficult for me to care for them burdened with the notion that I too, could be one them. To my surprise, one of these women was transferred to the local hospice facility for end-of-life care and I felt a sense of guilt as I watched her mobilize to the hospice dinner table.\n\nI terminated my relationship with the prescribing psychiatrist of 10 years, from March 2004 to September 2014, and received chastising comments for my actions from my GP at the time. My GPs disapproval instilled feelings of guilt and the need for me to make amends by sending a 2014 Christmas card to the prescribing psychiatrist.\n\nI would connect with a new psychiatrist December 2014 and she suggested the mainstay of treatment should be psychotherapeutic in nature describing the purpose of this treatment format and how I would benefit from such treatment. I am saddened to read of the individual I had become as described in the new initial psychiatric assessment in December 2014. The negative experiences from psychotropic medication changes, discontinuing psychotropic medication and with healthcare professionals contributed to feeling like she is constantly being judged...she is afraid of being humiliated by others...she struggles with feeling like a fraud and that they can see her dysfunction...and is worried that her co-workers can see it in her. In addition, this initial consult reports chronic pain in her arms, shoulders, chest, through her legs for the last year and a half and has seen doctors who believe it might be fibromyalgia...there are chronic gastrointestinal symptoms with a possible diagnosis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome...her thought content was significant for decreased self-worth and she spoke about herself with quite disgust and shame.\n\nI had finally discontinued all psychotropic medications with the exception of a small dose of Oxazepam for sleep for well over a year when I first listened to this particular CBC White Coat Black Art podcast in May 2018. This podcast and corresponding website providing links to reputable academic sources strongly suggests that pertinent information regarding patient safety and the physical and psychological side effects related to psychotropic medication changes has been known, present and available for decades. I find myself wondering why the prescribing psychiatrist, with all of his credentials, did not consider the various medication changes as the source for the exacerbation of physical and psychiatric symptoms and the onset of new symptoms I presented with. In hindsight, perhaps it is possible that the prescribing psychiatrist did suspect that some of my symptoms were related to psychotropic medication changes when he prescribed Nabilone for pain; he just never articulated his suspicions to me or the healthcare providers at my local walk-in medical clinic.\n\nIn November 2016 I requested my medical notes from the psychiatrist who initiated the course of Risperidone more than twelve years ago with the intent of complaining to the College of Physicians and Surgeons after caring for an elderly woman who was prescribed levodopa/carbidopa three times a day. Many patients are prescribed levodopa/carbidopa yet there was no mention of this woman having Parkinsons disease during shift report. It was discovered this woman presented with Parkinsonian symptoms as a result of taking Olanzapine for several decades. I could be this woman 20 years from now. This woman was later diagnosed with Stickmans Disease by the local neurologist.\n\nI continued to struggle with the physical and psychological symptoms that began when I attempted to discontinue Risperidone in 2012. I had been diagnosed with ADHD the previous year and the physical and psychological symptoms persisted affecting my ability to focus and concentrate contributing to feelings of increased confusion and self-doubt. Equally disabling is the the ADHD diagnosis/label itself. I now understand that I have lived with the same brain my whole life but I became fearful of ADHDs presence with increased incidents of forgetfulness when racing thoughts regarding my failing mind and body would interrupt the continuity of complicated processes of established learned skill-sets and well laid plans. I began to identify strongly with the geriatric population and considered the possibility of dementia.\n\nIn addition, I recently discovered I had renal health concerns during this time period learning that my kidneys were allergic to Hydrochlorothiazide. I developed hypertension during this era of psychotropic medication changes and I was having an adverse reaction to this medication. I began to experience neurological twitching in my fingers, increased numbness and tingling coupled with flank pain and my GP abruptly dismissed me without listening to my concerns stating I had somatoform disorder because I had a history of an eating disorder decades ago.\n\nPerhaps one of the most humiliating experiences was returning to the emergency room in the hospital where I was employed--for a second time--to describe these symptoms noted above and to state with transparency that these symptoms, as per my GP, were symptoms of somatoform disorder. I was referred to a nephrologist who identified a legitimate health concern and who would soon adopt the same attitude as my GP. I became a renal patient that day.\n\nWith my medical notes obtained November 2016, I submitted a formal written complaint to the College of Physicians and Surgeons in February 2017 regarding the psychiatric care received and this complaint went unheeded. I received the psychiatrists response to my initial complaint after June 28, 2017, and the content of his response confirmed:\n\n* I was only provided with my transcribed medical charts and not given the handwritten medical charts when I requested my medical files in November 2016.\n* The prescribing psychiatrist did not refer to my medical charts when inadvertently re-prescribing an ineffective medication for a second time in April 2014.\n\nReceipt of my handwritten medical charts in July 2017 reveal and support the notion that valid informed consent was never obtained or documented until April 2008 confirming my original query to the College of Physicians and Surgeons when I inquired Why wouldnt \\[the prescribing psychiatrist\\] discuss the side effects with me when I began taking Risperidone when he first prescribed the medication to me?\n\nI was emotionally scattered after receiving the prescribing psychiatrists response and had recently been approved for long-term disability through my employer benefit package. A series of negative interactions with healthcare professionals accelerated my determination to discontinue all psychotropic medications at this time. It was unsettling to observe a rheumatologist google the results of a pathology report of a recent skin biopsy after waiting months to see her and it was equally unsettling to have to request new bloodwork when a second nephrologist made reference to lab values from six months ago during a 6-month consult. This same nephrologist would document that I had discontinued all my medications with exception of oxazepam underscoring my sense of madness. This nephrologist ordered new bloodwork, at my request, stating that a renal biopsy may be ordered if proteinuria and hematuria were present--and they were. I considered relocating to a larger city to receive healthcare realizing that all future health concerns would be met with familiar disdain within the small community I resided in. \n\nI believed the continual proteinuria and hematuria was contributing to the physical symptoms I presented with and sought healthcare at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, November 2017. My humble and pitiful admission of traveling to the Mayo Clinic indicates the continued presence of physical and psychological symptoms months after discontinuing psychotropic medications and my own vulnerable and determined quest for answers knowing that the symptoms I presented with began within a specific time frame. The distinct stigma towards individuals with mental illness that I experienced in my hometown was all too prevalent at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona. My body was changing and declining in so many ways and I felt helpless and isolated.\n\nI overlooked the advisement of the College of Physicians and Surgeons to provide any new facts to be of particular significance to the issues at hand regarding my complaint about the psychiatric care I received for over a decade after receipt of the prescribing psychiatrists response to my initial letter of complaint and inbetween obtaining the other half of my medical chart. In addition, issues regarding abnormal lab values, disdainful healthcare professional attitudes, discontinuing medications and entertaining the idea of moving to a larger city also contributed to the oversight of the Colleges advisement. I could see the inconsistencies in the psychiatric care I received but did not possess the means to articulate these inconsistencies with appropriate medical and legal language nor could I present them in a timely manner. I am a team on one with limited time and resources.\n\nThe timing of listening to this academic conversation on CBCs White Coat Black Art addressing and discussing the physical and psychological side effects individuals often experience from discontinuing an array of psychotropic medications on May 11, 2018 could not have presented at a more opportune time: I was taking a lunch break from writing a Statement of Points to the Health Professions Review Board, at a local library in Vancouver, regarding the complaint I made to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia concerning the care I received from the prescribing physician over the course of 10 years when I first listened to this podcast. \n\nI believed the content of this CBC White Coat Black Art podcast so significant that I included the link to this podcast with subsequent links to When it comes to antidepressants, getting to zero proves difficult by Dr. Goldman, Many People taking Antidepressants Discover They Cannot Quit by Benedict Carey and Robert Gebeloff of The New York Times, and Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome by C. Warner and colleagues, in my Statement of Points to the Health Professions Review Board. I naively believed the Health Professions Review Board Panel would take the time to listen and consider the well researched and documented content of this CBC podcast that succinctly explains the source of the physical and psychological symptoms I endured for several years: symptoms related to antipsychotic and psychotropic medications.\n\nThe Health Professions Review Board decision favoured the initial psychiatrist and reported that the documents I submitted demonstrates that the Complainant is not a reliable historian and that she has demonstrated an unwillingness to accept a diagnosis or treatment that does not accord with her own view of her medical conditions as she understands them. \n\nMedical research and documentation relegated to medical textbooks in university and hospital libraries are now available online and it makes sense that I would search for corroborating medical knowledge to confirm that I endured numerous physical and psychological side effects resulting from psychotropic medication changes. The evident holes in my medical charts reveal that informed consent was not obtained until I had become reliant on this medications sedating properties. Online research will continue as the well-known adverse effects from antipsychotic and antidepressant medications are now openly revealed and discussed on public platforms including radio and television in addition to internet sources. To reiterate: I naively declared in my initial complaint to the College of Physicians and Surgeons that I began to experience many uncomfortable physical and emotional symptoms coinciding with a conscious attempt to discontinue Risperidone in 2012. These side effects were validated when listening to CBC and researching the numerous sources cited.\n\nMy original declaration was made without having obtained all my medical documentation and receipt of this documentation would confirm that I was not made aware of the irreversible side effects and difficulting discontinuing Risperidone when this medication was initially and subsequently prescribed until I addressed the issue of the inappropriate use of Risperidone as a chemical restraint in the elderly population in 2008. The Panel Chairs response to my review request minimizes the physical and psychological symptoms I experienced when attempting to discontinue Risperidone and the chemical psychotropic medication cycle perpetuated from this event for several years to follow. In addition, this response explicitly implies that the symptoms I experienced are a result of my own negligence placing the fault upon the psychiatric patient.\n\nThe personal nature of psychiatric treatment suggests that psychiatric patients are often emotionally and/or intellectually unstable and unreliable historians creating invisible barriers hindering the vulnerable psychiatric patients ability to complain effectively about psychiatric care they have received. The invisible barriers intimidate, discourage and prevent the psychiatric patient from submitting formal complaints against the psychiatric healthcare provider to appropriate governing bodies who dismiss their concerns favouring the psychiatric practitioner.\n\nI did not possess all the essential medical and legal language when formalizing my complaints to these governing bodies and their responses simply reiterate my mental illness history based upon the psychiatrists documentation stating I am an inaccurate historian rather than acknowledge that: \n\n* I was not provided with half of my medical chart essential to ensure greater accuracy in describing the historical events in my initial complaint regarding care received over a 10-year period;\n* the withheld medical charts indicates informed consent was not obtained during the first 4 years of care;\n* the prescriber neglected to refer to my medical chart prior to re-prescribing an ineffective psychotropic medication strongly suggesting that he, too, is an inaccurate historian;\n* The combination of numerous psychotropic medication changes, beginning with initial prescription of Risperidone in 2004, followed by numerous attempts to discontinue this medication in 2012 contributed to the numerous physical and psychological symptoms I would experience from years to come; and\n* the prescribing psychiatrist did not acknowledge the onset of exacerbated and unexplained symptoms as a result of psychotropic medication changes.\n\nAddressing my concerns to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia and extending my complaint further to the Health Professions Review Board were ineffective. On August 3, 2017, I registered a Petition to the Court in the Supreme Court of British Columbia to set aside decisions made my the Health Professions Review Board and The College of Physicians and Surgeons with the intent of remitting the matter back to the College of Physicians and Surgeons. I have enclosed a copy of the Petition to the Court for your perusal.\n\nThe barriers I experienced in registering this Petition were many and its contents may appear simple, naive, and lacking in both legal and medical expertise.\n\nI have cited and listed the same documentation I had provided electronic links to for the Health Professions Review Board to examine in an affidavit to Petition to the Court from the CBC White Coat Black Art podcast that aired May 11, 2018. Some of the documents cited as evidence affirm that knowledge of the physical and psychological symptoms attributed to discontinuing antipsychotic and antidepressant medications has been known for decades and should have been acknowledged by the initial prescriber of Risperidone. I would have also cited Dr. Richard Friedmans article A Call for Caution in the Use of Antipsychotic Drugs had I been permitted to submit additional documentation.\n\nI exercise respect when stating that I am not physician, a psychiatrist or a lawyer. I am an individual, a middle-aged woman, a caregiver, and a patient with a history of mental illness who encountered numerous obstacles and barriers necessitating tenacity in attempting to access the legal system independently when others would simply submit and accept to living with the same conditions believing themselves powerless, feeling voiceless and invisible. \n\nThe dismissive, and often humiliating, incidents I experienced from healthcare professionals occuring while under the care of the initial prescribing psychiatrist continued even after ending this patient/psychiatrist relationship. These incidents are not the primary issue in my legal suit requesting the Supreme Court of British Columbia to quash the Health Professions Review Board and College of Physicians and Surgeons decisions in favour of the initial psychiatrist; rather, these incidents were a manifestation of preconceived notions and stigmatic beliefs towards individuals with mental illness attempting to reclaim their mental wellness and serve to underscore the necessity for transparency between psychiatrist and patient. There is a defined series of events that transpired when I attempted to discontinue Risperidone in late 2012: a\n\nmedication I continued to request higher doses of without being informed of the potential irreversible side effects and the difficulting in discontinuing this medication. These events continued to undermine any legitimate health concerns I presented with in the small city I resided in and have affected the care and a diagnosis I received from a healthcare practitioner in the metropolis I currently reside in. It is fortunate that I acquire a GP here who is both an academic and a scientist. Dare I say, these events may not have occurred had I been given sufficient information to make an informed choice about the nature of Risperidone in 2004 when this medication was quickly prescribed in the final minutes of a 30 minute consult. \n\nI suspect that the initial prescribing psychiatrist recognized that the harm of his actions, or lack of actions, would require significant explanation and psychiatric care reflecting poorly upon him and his position in authority within a small healthcare community. In addition, it was less problematic for him, and perhaps somewhat of a relief, when I sought alternative mental healthcare after losing faith in his abilities.\n\nThe difficulty I experienced discontinuing Risperidone and subsequent psychotropic medications mirrors similar difficulties other patients have experienced exemplifying the Elephant in the Room idiom: The difficulty discontinuing psychotropic medications, including the powerful Risperidone, is an undesirable fact that remained unaddressed and ignored until reputable sources such as CBC and The New York Times presented this serious problem identifying the physical and emotional symptoms patients have experienced and their vain attempts to discontinue these medications only to experience failure and to have these symptoms attributed to their declining mental illness. I believe I have a legitimate complaint regarding the psychiatric care I received from 2004-2014 in that the prescribing psychiatrist and university professor had an understanding that I was physically and psychologically struggling to discontinue Risperidone and various psychotropic medications trialled when he prescribed Nabilone for pain. Prescribing a medication without obtaining informed consent and re-prescribing an ineffective medication in error only compounds the harm done by not identifying the disturbing symptoms I began to experience in 2012 when I attempted to discontinue Risperidone. \n\nRelocating to a larger city for healthcare has revealed that I have thin basement membrane disease, a renal aneurysm and a grade 2 rectocele in a relatively kind, emotionally safe and patient medical environment. Food has not been an issue for several years and this fact, in isolation, is emancipating. I take less analgesic and continue to live with intermittent pain, headaches, GI concerns and hypertension coupled with numbness and tingling that began during my journey. I struggle at times with a misaligned circadian rhythm and my sleep quality, for the most part, is moderate and I have been advised not to work nights shifts again. I long to be able to take that satisfying and re-energizing 20 minute midday nap that has been unattainable since discontinuing psychotropic medication well over a year ago. My cognition has evolved and matured since my initial complaint to the College in February 2017 regarding the psychiatric care I received for more than a decade and I can define my concerns with greater clarity.\n\nI recognize and even expect that my description of events may be, yet again, dismissed as a result of mental illness contributing to medical, scientific or unkind comments regarding my emotional demeanor. After all, I am a psychiatric patient and psychiatric patients are poor historians.\n\nThe issues of mechanically prescribing powerful psychotropic medications, such as Risperidone, without providing adequate medication information in a manner easily understood by patients, medical complacency in continuous prescribing of large doses of psychotropic medications without inquiring into the patients logic and reasoning for their non-compliance, re-prescribing ineffective psychotropic medication without referring to a patients medication history and not identifying and associating the onset of increased or new symptoms with psychotropic medication changes need to be addressed in a medical culture that often corrects emotional maladies with a pill. \n\nMy mental health history clearly indicates the desire to discontinue the psychotropic medication Risperidone and I was prescribed this medication without appropriate medication information. These facts coupled with experiencing the onset and continuation of very uncomfortable physical and psychological symptoms when attempting to discontinue Risperidone with insufficient support was both socially and medically undermining marking the beginning of sad and stressful chapter in my life that I look forward to closing. Resiliency should not be this difficult.\n\nIn conclusion, this journey has been one of isolation coupled with fears of being ostracized for burdening others with my concerns and linked hand-in-hand with suggestions and explicit statements that I was a burden, a waste of time, while attempting to have some of the physical and psychological symptoms I experienced from psychotropic medication changes addressed. I simply state that my journey has consisted of a series of experiences that have negatively impacted my physical and psychological well-being. I am apprehensive, yet clearly in need of returning to meaningful employment. My thoughts are more clear and I recognize I have been provided with the gift of time and the opportunity to share my concerns with you and to register these concerns with the Supreme Court of British Columbia. As mentioned previously, the tone of this letter is written calmly and is meant to be read and interpreted in this manner and I hope to maintain this demeanour when I present to the Supreme Court.\n\nI have encountered many individuals who feel this endeavour will fail; however, the attempt has been made, the concerns addressed and the event recorded for others to follow as the inconvenient truths about psychotropic medications are revealed.\n\nI am presently unsure of how to reestablish a life with purpose and self-worth and trust I will continue to recognize and acknowledge unexpected events as opportunities to reclaim my mental wellness in a new journey towards self-discovery.'"

That said  Anyone else here have sciatica stemming from having to sit with a foot propped up due to lower-extremity surgery? \n\nI (59F) had surgery on my left ankle approximately 4 weeks ago. I was instructed to be non-weight bearing for 4 weeks, and to keep my foot elevated as much as possible for at least a week, preferably 2, to help keep the swelling down. This was fine for the first few days, and then the trouble began. \n\nAfter surgery, my foot was almost completely numb for several days, which I was not concerned about due to the nerve block and/or swelling. As it gradually woke up, and as I sat and sat and sat (reclined with my foot propped up higher than my heart), I started to have an uncomfortable pulling feeling in my leg, and it got harder and harder to get comfortable. The worst was at night, trying to sleep. There were zero comfortable positions, and I started experiencing jolts/shocks in my foot that were awful and made me jump. I was exhausted.\n\nAt about the 1.5-week-post-surgery mark, I contacted the doctor about the continuing foot numbness and he prescribed a corticosteroid, presumably to reduce swelling (and thus pressure on the nerves that run through the ankle joint). Then when I went for my 2-week visit to get my stitches out, I told him I was struggling with the foot jolts/shocks, and he offered to prescribe Gabapentin. Initially I declined, since I have a neighbor who became suicidal on Gab, but I had a TERRIBLE night that night with the foot jolts and general discomfort in bed, so I called the next morning and asked for a RX. (Apparently hes not the most diligent Gab prescriber as he didnt ease me into the 1200 mg/day dose he wanted me on. Thankfully I read up on it and eased into 900 mg/day over a couple of days. 1200 is way more than I need, so Ive never taken the full dose).\n\nAt this point, having been on Gab for about 10 days, I am able to sleep well (in one position only but at least I have that!), and I am generally comfortable during the day so long as I take my daytime dose of Gab. If I try to do without it, the sciatica pain returns. Its definitely not the 10/10 that some of you experience, but its not great either, and it flares if I try to sit with my foot up, which of course Im supposed to keep doing.  Ive been doing the Big Three sciatica exercises to try to knock it down, but Im still struggling. Im thinking it might not calm down until I can actually walk on both feet again.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with a flare due to lower extremity surgery recovery? I do have a spine doc due to presumed SI joint pain (he took an X-ray and said everything looked normal, but I think I have hypermobility issues that cause pinching)  Should I be trying to get in and see him about this or wait and see? It is so distressing not to be able to do right by my poor ankle. Other than the exercises Im already doing, what else could I try?\n\nTIA.'"

bactrim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/13dm1en/sulfa_allergy/,b'Sulfa Allergy',,"b'I recently went through the most horrible experience of my life because of an unknown allergy to sulfa drugs. Last week I was in the hospital with a kidney stone and a kidney infection and I was prescribed bactrim for an antibiotic. I was taking said bactrim without any known side effects for a week. I felt slightly nauseous after taking it for the first few days but was told that was normal and so they gave me zofran to combat that side affect little to know that could have been an early onset allergy. I started to develop a slight sore throat and my lymph nodes started to swell over the weekend and I thought it was just a bad reaction to maybe developing a cold since some close friends I was around had a cold. How wrong I could be, over night from Sunday into Monday I woke up sweating to death with a high grade fever and thick hives from head to toe. I couldnt believe this had developed over night. It felt like stinging nettles all over my body. My family thinking it was either mono or strep took me to the urgent care. The urgent care had me sit and wait suffering in the waiting room and everyone was staring at me. They eventually took me back did a strep test and their doctor in there said they had no idea what it could have been and said they didnt do blood work and thought I could have been going septic from my kidney infection even though my symptoms had improved. So they told me to get to the er. Well I showed up to the er the least was long again they eventually took me back took care of me. Hooked me up to every machines they could with IV. They gave me IV Benadryl which was scary because I think they pushed the medicine too fast it went in my bloodstream so quickly I started to choke on the air and was seeing double, feeling woozy and nauseous. My thoughts became irrational I thought I was going to die because I had a tight chest pain and couldnt breathe and felt like passing out. If Im presented with iv Benadryl again I will tell them to either push it slower or just give me an oral dose because that was one of the scariest moments in my life. They prescribed me Benadryl prednisone and Pepcid for my symptoms. After 2 days from being out of the hospital my rash is starting to disappear but I am writing this after being super restless in the night. I dont ever think my itchiness is going to disappear. Ive upped the dose on my Benadryl and I have applied topical. It does help a bit but it persists. This isnt like a normal itch , once you scratch a moment later it feels like youre on fire until you scratch again and the cycle repeats. Its worse at night since when Im sleeping I scratch out of instinct and I wake up burning. I just wish I knew there was this slightest possibility of allergy when the doc prescribed it. Before this Ive only known a slight allergy to bananas which doesnt really affect me too much or anything just scratchy tongue for a few mins. Ive heard theres a possibility of cross intolerance to sulfites and sulfates, what should I know?'"

penicillin swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/2qlbi3/looking_for_advise_on_current_routine/,b'Looking for advise on current routine',,"b""To preface: I'm 16 years old. Around two months ago I started breaking out. I've always had mild acne, but over the course of a few weeks my entire face was covered with acne and red raised skin. I went from almost no acne to both of my cheeks, chin, and hairline covered with the stuff. My routine for the past 2 years has been regular 2% salicylic acid wash, but once my breakout began I started to use a 10% benzoyl peroxide wash. At the peak of my breakout, (around the first week of this month) I finally went to a dermatologist, and ended up getting a laser treatment to bring down my swelling, and a culture on my acne to make sure it wasn't a staph infection. I was prescribed [acticlate](http://www.drugs.com/mtm/acticlate.html) (oral 75mg), [sumadan](http://www.drugs.com/pro/sumadan-wash.html) (sulfur) wash, [ziana](http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-146309/ziana-topical/details), [aczone](http://www.rxlist.com/aczone-gel-drug.htm), and [clindamycin phosphate](http://www.rxlist.com/clindamycin-phosphate-topical-solution-drug.htm). The routine given was:\n\n> Morning: Sumadan wash, aczone, and clindamycin (then moisturize).\n\n> Before bed: Sumadan wash, aczone, and ziana (then moisturize).\n\nLast week my culture came back negative for staph. I had done this routine for 3 weeks and I didn't get the slightest result. I was hopeless and started to experiment. Two days ago I abstained from the topicals (azone, clindamycin, and ziana) and only stuck to the sulfur wash and acticlate (plus moisturizer). Ever since then my swelling has gone down at least 70% and I'm not getting any new acne. \n\nIt's worth mentioning I'm allergic to penicillin, amoxicillin, and  a range of other antibiotics. Is it dangerous to suddenly abstain from my topicals? Am I allergic to my topical creams? My skin hasn't been this much better in at least 50 days. My eating habits haven't changed (I eat fairly healthy) and I'm a runner (20+ mpw) so I drink a lot of water.\n\nI'm going to a new dermatologist soon due to a few problems I had with the former one who put me on these medications.\n\nSo my overall question(s): is it bad that I'm suddenly not taking my prescriptions anymore? Am I possibly allergic to them? Thanks in advance."""
corticosteroid itch,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/9yk6i5/10_year_mystery_disease_its_not_lupis/,"b""10 year mystery disease (it's not lupis?)""",,"b'This is going to be TL;DR. Guaranteed.\n\nI should probably start with this. I\'m aware I come off as having a touch of the artism. Maybe I do. Maybe it\'s a symptom? Maybe people are just fucked? I dunno. I recognise (for the most part) when I\'m saying or doing something others might find off-putting or strange, but I do it anyway, and generally for well calculated reasons. Or maybe I\'m just socially inept. Who knows.\n\nI\'m leaving out a TON. I know that while a detailed history is probably the key to a correct diagnoses, I also know that no one will ever read it. I\'m just outlining the basics here. I\'ve got a mountain of diagnostics behind all of this, but I\'m keeping it out of the OP as I don\'t want to introduce any bias. I\'ve written and re-written out my history more times than I can recall, and it always ends up being 50 pages, list form, just to get through the medical history.\n\nI\'ve had at least 20 different diagnoses, all incorrect or just un-provable. I\'m not a fan of cop-out disease spectrums like ""CFS"". Fuck that shit. There\'s a real pathophysiology behind that name somewhere, and I\'ve seen terms like it get thrown around due to laziness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\'ve also spent the past decade doing arm-chair medical research (yea no... not hypothyroid-mom/naturalnews guys...). I\'ve read probably over 5000 papers on subjects relating to my symptoms/onset/progression. I\'ve made tones of connections, but at the same time, part of the disease is fairly frequent cognitive impairment, and an almost complete inability to form new memory from pure data (this is a whole long story as well, but essentially I can\'t remember shit. Instead, I\'ve resorted to learning to develop new concepts, and it actually works out pretty well for many things, but trolling through 5000 papers and being unable to retain individual data points, makes it near impossible for me to compute my way out of this). I am confident that given the data I have available to me currently, if I could plug it all into a simply stupid neural net, it\'d laugh at me and have the answer instantly. I am nearly positive that sufficient data exists to solve this, I just lack the memory to keep it all in mind long enough to cross reference it all. \\*sigh\\*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is sorta a bounty. I\'m at a point in my life where I have enough money to survive a few years without work, but at the same time, if I get any worse, I won\'t be able to work at all. I currently work from home, and even that is a challenge and I cannot be terribly reliable. If I can\'t solve this at all, I\'ll have no use for my savings. At 36 I should be roughly in my prime. My prime was instead, the day before the initial onset, in my early 20\'s. Since then, you might as well consider me 85 years old. Honestly, I know 85 yo\'s with more energy to do stuff than I have currently (and I\'m having a relatively good few months). I can\'t give an exact figure, but I can guarantee that if someone figures this out, they won\'t feel like they\'ve wasted their time.\n\n\\*\\*History:\\*\\*36, male, Caucasian. 6\'3"" - 6\'5"" (depends on the day), 150 - 210lbs (depends on the week). Currently in the PNW, but have lived all over Canada.So very long story, as thus far, over 100 gp\'s/specialists haven\'t figured out anything, and coincidentally, precisely 0 have heard even a complete list of symptoms, let alone family history or potential environmental factors. I strongly suspect that family history and/or environmental history may be important, but describing my history would require a few volumes so I\'ll try to keep it as concise as possible.\n\nSo, I had asthma and allergies as a child. Grew up on a farm which probably didn\'t help. Around age 12 I got kicked outta my house and sorta wandered around until I ran into my biological father with whom I stayed for a year or so until he went for coffee and never came back ;). It was about that time that I started smoking, and it didn\'t occur to me then, but it\'s blatantly obvious in retrospect, that is exactly the time my asthma and allergies disappeared.I worked hard manual labour for most of my young life, from age 8 to around 22. From oil field, digging ditches, chipping tar off industrial furnaces and building pool tables. Throughout all of that though, I was always extremely healthy.Somewhere around age 20, I got sick for the first time in years. Throat hurt like mad. I hadn\'t been to a doctor in almost a decade until then. They gave me a prescription I couldn\'t afford and didn\'t tell me what was wrong. An ex-GF came to the rescue and pointed out to my dumb ass that there are generics for 1-20th the price. Got that, and got better.A few years later I finally started getting my shit together. Built myself into a career (IT management), was generally stable for a bit. I was extremely active my entire life.Somewhere in my mid-20\'s (I believe I was working at IBM at that point), I started experiencing a mild loss of visual acuity as well as throat constriction in the late afternoon to early evening. It was consistent in it\'s timing, but severity was increasing over a few months. Ultimately we figured I had Hashimotos (confirmed with antibody tests). Synthroid fucking raped me. First 88mcg dose landed me in the ER, thinking I was having a heart attack. Everyone insisted nothing was wrong and told me to continue taking it. At that point I had none of the hallmark symptoms. Certainly not a loss of energy, but I didn\'t know any better at the time so I just listened to my docs. The panic attacks following each dose lasted for months, but the throat constriction and visual acuity issues did resolve about 50%.Stuff was mostly normal for 2 years, until age around 25. At that point I was in the best physical condition of my life. I\'d  been weight training and had finally managed to gain some mass. I was up to 205lbs (6\'5""). I was running a marathon a week, plus several km/day, plus hardcore mountain biking a few days a week, plus yoga, rock climbing, long boarding, on top of my regular weight training. I\'ve only ever met one man who could outrun/outlast me when I was at that point. I think this may also point to a hint though. My strength, for my size, was commonly referred to as ""retard strength"", and running 40km didn\'t have me breathing hard. I felt pretty much invincible, unless you kicked me in my shins, my only weakness. At that point I was eating at least 4000 calories/day on my slow days, and also still smoking a pack a day.\n\nThen, cause girl, I quit smoking. Two weeks later my life pretty much (entirely) ended. I woke up with my eyes bloodshot and itchy as all hell. I figured a cat must\'ve licked me in the eye-balls or something while I was asleep so thought nothing of it, figuring it\'d resolve on it\'s own. Happened that myself and the girl were going on vacation starting that day, so we headed to the coast. 3 days in, I realised I hadn\'t shat since we left and my gut was starting to get distended. 2 days later still nothing, and distention was up to around 10"". On the drive home, there was an audible \\*pop\\* (GF heard it over the truck) and I immediately blacked out. Got to the nearest ER, nothing wrong apparently.\n\nWent to my doc back home and he insisted that I just wasn\'t eating well and not getting enough exercise, so I gave up on him, given he knows my average day. Tried another, and another, and then 4 more. Most insisted nothing was wrong and told me to ignore the symptoms. Next morning I woke up blind. My vision was completely white for about 10 minutes, then spontaneously resolved. Still itchy and blood shot, but I could see normally. I decided to take matters into my own hands and quit gluten. 2 days later I pooped. And immediately passed out on the toilet, and woke up on the floor. From that point on, I have had 1/100th my previous energy/endurance. It was like a light switch. And when I say 1/100th, that is not an exaggeration whatsoever. I went from being able to run 40km in a stretch, to being barely able to walk to my truck to get to work, and then requiring help to get up the half flight of steps to my office. I\'d feel like shit when I got in, at about 10 or 11 am I\'d finally have to poop (explosively), which would result in passing out, or at least blacking out on the toilet. I\'d do that 4-6x over the course of an hour or two, and then I\'d go nap at my desk until around 2pm. Then I\'d wake up and feel better progressively throughout the day. Usually by 7 or 8pm I\'d feel like I wasn\'t dying, but still have very little energy. This went on for several years before the severity decreased and things stabilised a little. Throughout that time I saw >60 doctors and specialists (none every found anything wrong with me), tried multiple elimination diets (not sure if any worked, but I landed on a diet of steak/potatoes/blueberries/coconut oil and that\'s all I eat now).It took me YEARS before I finally thought back to when this all started, and the only two changes in my life  prior to onset, were quitting smoking, and new GF. Tested various possibly theories regarding something sexually transmitted, but everything was always negative. On paper, I was extremely healthy. So I finally tried smoking cigarettes again. The next day I woke up feeling better than I had in 5 years. I decided to keep smoking as much as I could for 3 months to see what happened, and throughout that time, I essentially went into remission. The symptoms were still there, but the severity was decreased 90%. I could go for walks again, occasionally I could even jog a little. I stopped passing out after taking a shit or going from sitting to standing, etc. So my 3 months came up and ""for the science"", I quit smoking again. First day without cigarettes and every symptom increased in severity by 2-3x, and another 2-3x the day after. I for some reason, kept not smoking for about a year before I finally tried it again, and it was a year of absolute hell. Constant panic attacks, severe IBS, zero energy, all my joints started to hurt, eyes bloodshot and itchy, substantial cognitive deficit, etc.Started smoking again, and as before, severity of all symptoms decreased dramatically. For some reason I keep thinking I\'m fooling myself, so I quit smoking again and die for a year before I remember to smoke. I to this day, still dont\' know what I think about this.\n\nSo, that\'s the gist of the story. There is MUCH more to it than that, but I think that\'s the important history.As for symptoms:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chronic/Constant (never resolves completely):**\n\n* **Fatigue, lack of endurance.** I still have the retard strength, but only for a few seconds at a time.\n* **IBS (or something)**. This waxes and wanes dramatically. At best, I\'ll have 2-3 days a year where my poop is normal. The norm is to poop 2-5x per morning, feel super weak for a few hours, and slowly recover. At worst, it\'s either 6+x in the morning and then constant stabbing pains in the GI, or constipation for days or sometimes over a week.\n* **Edema?** \\- This is a weird one. Legs absolutely do not look like the have edema, but any small amount of pressure on them for a few seconds, leaves a clear dent for 15-20 minutes. EG: if I have my calf rested on the coffee table and the edge is touching at all, it\'ll leave a very clear impression of the table in my leg for at least 15 minutes. I can just grab my leg anywhere below the knee and squeeze for a few seconds, and leave a hand print for 15 minutes. Looks really strange if I\'ve been sitting cross legged in the driveway , as it\'ll leave a perfect imprint of the asphalt and it looks like my leg is falling apart.  \nBut, it absolutely does not look like edema is present until the intent is in place. I finally recently managed to convince my latest NP to let me hang out for 2 minutes with my leg slightly rested against her desk, to show her the intent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chronic/intermittent (comes and goes, but is most often present.**\n\n* **Flu like symptoms**. Extreme fatigue/malaise. I describe it to people as ""the worst flu you\'ve ever had, and then just bump it up a few more notches"". I\'ve never found anything which obviously precedes onset. I just wake up and my week is screwed. Zero chance of doing anything. Sometimes lasts months, and in one case for almost 2 years. Other times it lasts 2 hours and resolves completely and entirely spontaneously.\n* **Small red/purple dots on lower legs**. Looks like petechiae. When they resolve, I\'m left with what looks like a strange scar. I tricked my Internist into biopsying one of them, and he says results say it\'s ""some kind of granulomatos vasculitis"", but did not follow up.\n* **Brain fog**. This term gets thrown around a lot and I used to think it was a bad term, but there\'s really nothing better suited to describe it. The world feels hazy. I know my cognitive function is impaired, so something is still working well enough to know something is wrong in the brain compartment, but not well enough to focus on, and/or solve complex tasks.\n* **Heart palpitations/bradycardia/tachycardia.** This comes and goes often. Is near constant in terms of, it happens quite a few times on almost all days. Some days it just doesn\'t stop. Took me years to figure out though that when it begins, I can make it stop in an instant by simply crouching down. I\'ll be working on my truck, or standing at my desk, or walking in a store and my heart rate will jump up to 150-170bpm instantly. I crouch down and it beats 4 or 5 more times and then light a switch, it\'s instantly back to 60-70bpm. There is no ramp down time. It changes from one beat to the next. Instant resolution nearly 99% of the time.\n* **Panic attacks**. These were frequent at early onset, then disappeared for years, and then came back again for a few more years (constant, every day, every hour), and then decreased in severity beginning last year, and now mostly gone again.\n* **Asthma**. If I quit smoking, I have severe asthma that is not controllable with salbutamol nor corticosteroids. If I start smoking again, it resolves completely within\' a few days.\n* **Extreme post-meal drowsiness**. I eat, and almost immediately need a nap for an hour or so. Cannot keep my eyes open.\n* S**trange sensation of emptiness in gut.** When this occurs, drinking any water results in panic attacks. Eating resolves the sensation temporarily, but I can eat a full meal and my stomach and upper GI feel completely empty again in 15 minutes. Sounds a lot like dumping syndrome.\n* **Abdominal bloating/distension**. So far we\'ve never found any cause for it. 10"" distension and nothing on ultrasound.\n* **Severe lower back and mid back pain**. L5-S1 area, and between shoulder blades. Confirmed there are very mild herniations or moderate bulges in both locations, but according to everyone thus far, nowhere near enough to account for any of my symptoms. The pain alternates between the left and right sides of each joint, and when it starts, just walking around carefully will result in severe, but intermittent stabbing pains. Being careful doesn\'t seem to have any affect on whether or not this devolves to the point where I cannot sit or stand. Some times it just goes away after a few days, other times I\'ll need help getting to the bathroom as the pain is so severe it causes me to just black out. I have an absurdly high pain tolerance, but this is like nothing else. Being stabbed through the hand I just shrugged off. Walking on a broken leg 20km, and having to climb a mountain to get out of the bush, no problem by comparison. This is the kind of searing pain that I just can\'t describe any other way other than ""my body just says ""fuck this shit"" and shuts down my brain"". I have no control over it.  I can tell when it\'s going to happen,  days in advance. There is no discomfort, just a feeling of weakness in the skeletal muscles or something. If I am extremely careful, I might avoid a full blown stabbing attack. I dunno.\n* **Itchy eyes**. No idea what causes this. Eyes just get incredibly itchy usually on the inside corners and nothing resolves it. They get bloodshot and look very mildly infected. If I do nothing about it, I go blind. Once it starts, I just flood them with synthetic tear stuff and colloidal silver until it resolves usually a week later. 100% of the time I do nothing, it never resolves.\n* **Random stabbing pains**. Everywhere. In my brain, chest, arms, legs, and a particular part of my anal sphincter (right side, and it\'s the only place that\'s consistent). Happens quite often but usually only a few times in a day. Severe pain lasting half a second. Makes me fall off the couch, or loose my hold on a rock while climbing, thus I can\'t climb anymore as I can\'t trust my shit to not just let go.\n* **Feeling like I\'m not getting enough oxygen**. This is relatively rare, but always distrubing. My O2 saturation is normal each time, but feels like I\'m running on half a lung. Spontaneously resolves 10 minutes later.\n* **Zero appetite**, but gut goes to hell if I don\'t eat every few hours. If I don\'t get a good 50/50 mix of protien and starch within\' 5 hours, I start shaking, getting super weak, vision goes dark, and i\'ll eventually just lose consciousness.\n* The list could go on for days, but these are the common ones. I\'ll add more if/when I think of them.\n* See, right there I forgot one of the biggest symptoms. **Inability for form new memory.** This waxes and wanes in severity, but is constant. At it\'s worst, it\'s Memento. On average, it just means I can\'t retain new facts. I strongly feel this has gone on for so long that my brain actually rewired itself in a way in which I am more easily able to create new concepts than I am able to retain a single fact. I argue constantly, and I know I\'m mostly full of shit because I cannot retain data, but conceptually I just ""get"" things now. It makes me appear somewhat stupid to most people, but able to pull correct summations out of my ass with regularity (because conceptually I get it, even if I can\'t remember it).\n\n**Diet:**\n\nI eat potatos, red meat, blueberries, coconut oil, chives, salt, and a coconut protein powder. Nothing else. I\'ve eaten nothing else in the past year, and it\'s been one of my most stable years. I\'m sure that I can occasionally eat other foods without any issue, but most of the time they seem to make my gut hurt almost immediately, and cause severe GI issues for the next week.I also went a year without red meat, and instead substituted with baby birds. That seemed to go okay as well, but the thought of eating another bird makes me pretty much puke in my mouth a little. For whatever reason, red meat and pork, while I\'m super sick of both, don\'t disgust me yet.I am absolutely sick of eating. I hate it. I\'m never hungry, but I know if I don\'t force feed myself, I\'ll start dying in a few hours. Eating is a chore. I feel like it\'d be less a chore if I could eat anything goddamned else, but I\'m too paranoid to try anything, given I seem to have severe reactions occasionally to things that I\'m fine with on other days.I\'ve never had any apparent reaction to meat/potatoes/blueberries/chives/coconut oil, so I stick with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Exercise:**\n\nRapes me. If I intentionally try to go for a run, or especially if I try to do any weight lifting or anything that would normally result in an increase in muscle mass, I\'m fucked for at least a week, usually two. Everything starts to hurt 2-3 days after any strenuous activity, and results in almost all the symptoms I\'ve experienced, increasing in severity by a few factors, for a week or two. I become non-functional.Very occasionally, I\'ll wake up and know I\'m okay to work out. I\'ll do so, and I\'ll feel fantastic, and have no detrimental effect. This occurs about once a year, for 3-4 days.When I\'m having an only somewhat abnormally good day, I can get away with doing some very light work out. IE: I can do some knee/leg lifts while holding myself up tucked into the corner of the counter, and it feels AMAZING. I can\'t do sit ups or any yoga as they\'ll both destroy my back for a few months.\n\nOn the rare occasion I do work out, I\'m always blown away by the fact that I actually LOOK healthy. Like, I look like I\'ve been working out and lifting weights with regularity all my life. It\'s like nothing ever went wrong. (and this is probably the crux of dealing with doctors, as they absolutely can\'t believe me about how dead I really am inside, when I seem outwardly, to look to be in ridiculously good physical condition).\n\n**Coordination/spacial awareness:**\n\nGoing for a walk on most days, most of my joints either hurt or just don\'t feel right. My coordination is definitely impaired. Prior to disease, I was an elf. I had no problem running up tree and doing a back-flip, or hucking my bike 40\' and pancaking out. Now, I have to very consciously calculate the intended trajectory of my knees, then feet, in order to walk like a human. If I\'m not thinking about it, I\'m clumsy. I stumble, stub my toe into the ground (I\'ve broken every toe several times each due to this), stomp, or flail. I feel like Elon Musk trying to imitate a human, every time I walk. \\*Ah, this is how a human do, so shall I too, do\\*. That actually goes through my head every time I walk to the store.Again, this is all transient. On a good day, I can probably parkour here, I can parkour there. I can parkour in a box, I can parkour with a fox. On an average day I\'ll fall over if I\'m not actively paying attention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Allergies:**\n\nNo idea. I had severe (anaphylactic) reactions to peanuts and horses when I was young, but those seemed to go away somewhere around age 12. Up until a few years ago, I still ate a few normal foods. Apples (the ones with the dull red that taste terrible) always made my mouth itchy and gave me a bit of a stomach ache. The shiny red once (macintosh?) were sometimes fine, and sometimes made my mouth itchy.On paper, according to IgE/IgG tests, I\'m deadly allergic to everything (test was about 8 years ago), but that included foods I was eating regularly at the time, and not completely dying. According to prick tests, I\'m only allergic to some grasses.I went full potato (ha! A PUN!) with the elimination diet test. I don\'t recall the specifics of the first test, but I stuck to 3 foods total, for 4 months. Then switched to 3 totally unrelated foods (ie: no known cross reactivity) for another 4 months. Not sure I ever noticed a difference.\n\n**Random:**\n\nOn a side note, the first few years I felt severely nauseous. It lasted for 2 or 3 years where I felt like I was going to vomit 100% of the time. I have not puked since I was 15 though (last time I drank a Newfie under the table).I\'m not sure if I ever actually ""get sick"". It would be very hard to differentiate between a flu and my regular day. I\'m either invincible, or everything is so perfectly fucked up that I\'ve gone all Mr. Burns and my shit\'s all just in perfect horrible balance.\n\nOkay, so I don\'t want to get into detail on the diagnostics we\'ve got so far, nor any of the theories I\'ve covered, as I dont\' want to introduce bias. I will provide diagnostic results if anyone has any to request.  I\'ve got about 200  pages of diagnostics. Mostly normal, some obviously abnormal. The only thing I want to hint at is that a lot of the diagnostics strongly suggest SLE (Lupis), but as we know, it\'s never Lupis.\n\nI will also point out that, by crazy coincidence or otherwise, both my mother and father seem to have the same disease. Similar onsets, similar spectrum of symptoms, similar progression. Also, everyone on my dads side of the family is right messed up with the same issues, except 100% of those who were life-long smokers. They live to 100 and are all driving race cars until someone tells them in their late 90\'s that they are too old for race cars.\n\nI\'ve now seen over 100 docs/specialists. Honestly though, and I don\'t want to be that guy who says everyone but me is stupid, but over 90% of the useful diagnostics I\'ve got on paper, came from me stealing diagnostic requisitions to test my own theories. I apparently look too healthy, so docs don\'t take me seriously, even when I bring them diagnostics in hand, to prove something has gone horribly awry. Not a single one of my docs has looked at past diagnostics, most haven\'t ordered any themselves, and almost all are 100% convinced this is all just hypothyroidism, or purely psychosomatic. Every time they say that, I try to show them the labs that prove otherwise (there are many), and they outright refuse to look at them. Something isn\'t right there. Hell, I\'ve had chronic GI issues since day one and I haven\'t been able to convince any doc to order me and endoscopy. Diagnostics strongly suggest celiac is a thing, which I understand is supposed to be confirmed by a followup upper endo, but no doc agrees that such confirmation is of any value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*My life currently:\\*\\***\n\nI lucked out like mad. As I was homeless for a number of years, so working from home, making a decent living on my own hours, having a savings, etc, is pretty fantastic. If I hadn\'t got into the career I did, at the time I did, I would be dead. Zero question of that. There is precisely no possibility of me ""going to work"" at this point, nor at any time since the initial onset.I have enough energy once in a while that I can go out 4x4ing or something as long as I\'m careful to not get busted and have to roll around under my truck. If/when that happens, I rely 100% on someone else to help me get home, as any physical exertion and I\'ll just pass out, or start having a panic attack, and then pass out. I can\'t even think about doing anything until I\'ve finished pooping for the day, which usually isn\'t till at least noon, and given it\'s dark by 5pm and takes 2 hours round trip to get the fuck out of this city, it is very rare that I can find anyone else to come with me and act as my backup.I have days where things aren\'t horrible. I can get up, hack on my truck, maybe do a bit of work in the yard, etc. I have days where I have 7 naps in between panic attacks. On an average day, I have about an hour or so where I can do very light physical work.I can\'t plan anything more than 20 minutes in advance because I just can\'t predict my health that far ahead. I try to get out camping at least once a year, but it\'s usually horrible. Essentially, I generally have an hour or two a day where I can be functional at all. The rest of the day is a mix of naps, showers (they seem to fix panic episodes?), lying around head-booping my cats.Throughout 2014-2017 was fucking terrible. I don\'t think I had a good or okay day in that time. This past 8 or 9 months has been sorta exceptionally decent, where I haven\'t had any severe symptoms last longer than a few days at a time.Every few years I\'ll wake up and feel ""normal"". Like, nothing hurts, I don\'t feel like I need to poop 8x before noon, but not pooping 8x before noon doesn\'t result in cognitive problems. On these days, it\'s like nothing bad ever happened. I can quite literally, run a marathon on those days and feel completely fine. I might even be fine for another 2-3 days. Then I\'ll wake up dead and it\'s back to my regular ""norm"".I smoke a pack a day and hate it, but I\'m terrified to quit again, as without exception, every time I quit, the longer I stay quit, the worse all symptoms get, to the point I end up in the ER every day until I start smoking again. It\'s not just a few weeks of withdrawl. I\'ve quit for years at a time, and those years were by far the worst. I\'m mostly hoping I\'ve got some interesting SNP\'s that make me less likely to die from lung cancer. I figure at this point though, I\'d much rather die of lung cancer a month from now, than live with the symptoms I\'d have for that month without smoking. I\'ve spent years debating with myself about whether or not this is valid.\n\nI don\'t look sick. At all. People almost always assume I am in excellent physical condition and even my few friends have a hard time believing my health is as bad as it is. I should\'ve got fat, or skinnier, or paler, or something. I look like a very healthy early 30\'s guy who\'s taken very good care of himself, eats well, exercises regularly, lives an  active life. If I trim the wizard beard down to less absurd levels of wizardry, I\'m mistaken for mid-late 20\'s. I fear if I shaved the beard entirely, I\'d be mistaken for an infant. I just don\'t look the part.\n\nIn terms of energy, some examples:\n\n* I can, on an okay day, do 40 or so chin ups, as long as my joints don\'t fuck off. On a bad day I can easily do 3 or 4, but then power out completely and start shaking.\n* I used to be an expert climber, and could stick to an overhang all day easily. Realistically now, I can easily climb like a gecko for about 10 or 20 seconds before my hands just stop ""doing"", and/or I start shaking violently. Again, on an exceptional day where I feel normal, I regard the same climb as something that an infant could do. I could climb it all day without using my feet.\n* Just walking around my truck, trying to solve some problem, I\'ll just start shaking and get weak. Feels like hypoglycemia, but blood glucose is never dangerously low. If I try to push through, I\'ll just progressively black out until i\'m unconscious.\n* I honestly know several people over the age of 90, who are substantially more active than I can be on an average day. I see fat white soccer moms out for a power walk with their expensive power walking suits and all their high tech power walking gear, and I no longer feel any distain. Just jealously. Fat soccer moms are in better condition than I am. Honestly, I don\'t think a lot of 90 yo\'s are less active than I am.\n\n**Stuff I can pretty definitively say is true but don\'t like to draw causation from correlation for reasons which will be apparent:**\n\n* The throat constriction almost always goes away on higher doses of dessicated thyroid, or at least is much more pronounced when I\'m off it, or on lower doses.\n* The longer and more wizardly my beard, the worse I feel on average. Eyup, and that there is why we don\'t conflate correlation with causation...\n* My ability to eat most foods is hit and miss. I definitely experience obvious allergic reactions to many foods one day, but can be fine with them the next. Raw foods are MUCH more allergenic. I eat only food that has been thoroughly cooked to absolute death, and then deep fry it for good measure. Any hint of nutrition remaining in my food will cause me to have an allergic reaction to it. The only known exception is blueberries and meat.\n* Major crashes are preceded by an increase in severity of GI issues. There are some clear links between the various GI symptoms and resulting cognitive affects a few hours or days later. There is a link here but I don\'t know what it is. Whether or not it\'s a causal link, I don\'t know. I just know damned well that my brain will shut down shortly after certain gut problems.\n* Crashes occur far more frequently during seasonal changes, and fairly confident they occur far more often a day or so before it starts raining. (SAD is sad?)\n* On paper, I have no known pathogenic parasites, bacteria, or viruses.\n* Adrenaline (or something which occurs normally when adrenaline would be released) is horrible for me. I used to LOVE the rush of having a moose charge me, or a bear charge at me, or a pack of wolves charge at me (#farmlife), but since onset of the disease, I just shake violently, get super weak, and just generally hate adrenaline (or whatever happens). It\'s to the point where the actual POINT of most of the things I enjoyed doing, now just ruins my day. Even stuff that doesn\'t scare me in the least, like I\'m out wheeling (4x4 crawling) and climbing a bit ledge, the truck flops sideways a little, and I KNOW it\'s okay and I know nothing bad will happen, but my whole body\'s like ""neeeooope"" and starts shaking. Same with biking (when I can). Not a chance of doing a small jump anymore.\n* Marijuana. I never enjoyed it when I was younger. Same reason as alcohol. I just didn\'t like not being in total control of myself. A few years ago, given I know I\'ve got a bunch of inflammatory stuff going on, I decided to give it another serious try. Took a tiiiny little hoot and was absolutely wrecked baked in about 30 seconds. Feel like I\'m flying mach 9 feet first while spinning around, then about a minute or two later, my entire body gets incredibly itchy (on the inside of everything. I can feel my kidneys itch). Then I have a nap because I get super tired and also just want it to be over. Tried building up a tolerance over a few months and got to the point where I could deal with a small toke every few hours, but it was always horrible. Tried again last year and the itching was much worse, so I got paranoid about Anaphylaxis and gave up. Everyone around me smokes pot constantly (BC lower mainland, no one doesn\'t smoke pot). A few months ago the same itching I get from pot, hit me again for no apparent reason. It feels like all of my skin is simultaneously itchy and completely numb. Like I\'ve lost a majority of my tactile feedback.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things which preceeded the initial onset:**\n\n(By initial onset, I\'m generally referring to the first big crash, which took place about a year after I noticed the throat constriction)\n\n* Started weight training about 8 months prior. Gained from 170 to 205lbs in that time.\n* Started dating a girl who had pretty aggressive HSV1. This may have been my first exposure to it. She was in incredibly good health at all times, but still had regular flare ups. Was taking valacyclovir to keep it under control. Always thought it odd that she was in such good physical condition, but had flare ups.\n* Recently went to a dentist because a wisdom tooth finally exploded. I pulled out most of the first one myself as it\'d fallen apart pretty good, and I apparently got all of it, but the second one broke and a few pieces required a dentist. Dentist incidentally, ""accidentally"" while he was working on me, and drilled into the side of my jaw. He said ""whoops!"" and continued on. I didn\'t notice what\'d happened until I checked it out in the mirror the next day, and connected the extra hole to the ""whoops"". This was the first time I\'d been to a dentist in a decade or more.\n* I\'d gone from hard shitty manual labour, to desk work about a year or so prior to the first major crash. The initial throat constriction actually started earlier though, when I first took a desk job at IBM.\n* I finally grew a proper beard :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo...

Life is tough, but Ive managed to push through with coping mechanisms, external support, and medication. But recently, no matter what I do, I feel stuck in a state of severe depression with a relapsing eating disorder. \n\nI started working at a daycare November 14th. Before I started working there, I had caught RSV from my niece. I was actually on the mend when I first started working, but a child came in with COVID-19 and I caught it. I assume that my weakened immune system from the RSV left me vulnerable to COVID-19. Right after having COVID, I ended up in urgent care with a severe sinus infection. On top of all this, Ive been dealing with side effects and complications from medication. My body is still getting adjusted to Wellbutrin and the amoxicillin for the sinus infection caused an acid reflux flare up so bad that I couldnt swallow properly for a week. Honestly, these last two months have been awful.\n\nIve since recovered from my physical illnesses, but Im still facing the repercussions of them. I went from 140 pounds to 122 (the cause of my relapse), I deal with random migraines now, and my depression hasnt been this bad since high school. I feel like a codependent loser right now because Ive been leaning on my friends and family to keep my head above water. They say that its okay and that Im not bothering them but I still feel so bad. Ive been feeling completely worthless, basically. If it wasnt for them, Id probably be in the hospital.\n\nIve just been so suicidal recently. I cant seem to climb out of this hole. Im just so frustrated with feeling like shit; I cant even get out of bed some days. If anyone has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated. Im so sorry for how long this is.'"

My PCP is an Internist and I am on my 6th specialty type since 2021 (OBGYN x2, Urology, Gyn Oncology, Interventional Radiology, Gastro, and now Rheum). At this time, my PCP suspects some type of autoimmune/rheumatic process and has referred me to Rheumatology - she heavily suspected Lupus but my ANA was Neg so she wasn't sure how to proceed. The rheumatologist did several additional labs some of which were abnormal but they slapped me with a fibromyalgia diagnosis and claimed that this is what is going on even though a lot of symptoms / issues aren't explained by this diagnosis. I have a lot of information available  including labs and imaging if someone would be able to discuss more in detail. I have a second opinion with a new rheumatologist next week but at this point I'm running out of ways to advocate for myself. Autoimmune is a bit out of my scope. Not necessarily looking for a diagnosis here more so just guidance/advice as to what questions I should be asking or any other diagnostics that I should be advocating for? \n\n**Relevant Medical History:**\n\n First period started at 12yr; very heavy and painful but very regular  small clots only. \n\n Chronic Migraines since period started  treated PRN with Imitrex until 2020.\n\n Four pregnancies - 2 miscarriages, 2 healthy vaginal deliveries.\n\n Period became more significant after children; heavy/painful with large clots and longer (8-10d \n\nvs previous 5-7)\n\n Diagnosed with Asthma as a toddler but never had typical issues and it did not impact my QOL; \n\nalbuterol inhaler used only when sick / congested. \n\n Seasonal Allergies except they happen all year long and do not respond to antihistamines \n\nlots of sinus pain/pressure. \n\n History of frequent URIs and complications from illness. Approx 2-3 times per year I get a cold \n\nof some kind and require use of the albuterol inhaler. Almost every time, the illness will become \n\nbronchitis and/or pneumonia and require additional abx/steroids etc. to manage. Twice I have \n\nbeen to the ER for low SPO2. \n\n Sick or not, I crackle/wheeze when laying down and can usually cough and move or produce \n\nmucus. \n\n ALLERGIC TO BACTRIM  severe vaginal swelling, bleeding, and peeling.

A month ago I started to have back pain that resides in my middle-lower back only when im laying down(sleeping). The pain comes in maybe about 2-3 hours while im sleeping and then ill wake up due to the pain after 5 hours. After waking up once i get moving the pain goes away slowly until i dont notice it anymore. To note, I had hip pain first (hip flexor i believe) from working out and have been diligent in doing stretches to relieve both pains in my hip and my back. The stretches reduce the pain but its still there. Ive taken advil and cbd since they reduce inflammation but i dont think it is inflammation due to the pain still being there. Using heat seems to work a bit, heat pads and ointments keep that pain down but still present. \n\nWhere is it:\nI would say T-11 to T-12 if I were to number the spine? It happens to be a sharp throbbing pressure pain. If I were to have the pain on and do yoga, it would hurt to be in a cobra position. Then after a couple of sets of the cobra and Im more active, the pain just dissipates and is gone. The back muscle feels fatigued and I do feel a certain pressure pain in that area when Im sleeping and 5 hours in Id wake up to the pain.\n\n\nHistory:\nIve never had any back problems arise before, and I have bought a Posture corrector, its quite nice since my shoulders are more rounded, I do get told that I slouch quite a bit due to having a big bones and wide shoulders. Ive been using it for awhile, my posture seems a lot straighter than before however the pain still resides.\n\nExtra: \nI tried 3 different mattresses and pillows to no avail, the pain still resides. As for the hip, it only hurts when I bring my knee to my chest if I was to lay down. I do stay pretty healthy, i gym 5 days out of the week. Not super heavy weight but just enough for some strain. Im currently at a loss and would like to sleep normally again. \n\nThank you for your time and consideration. Any help would be much obliged! '"

I also knew it would help relieve those GABA receptors so they would be able to fully take on the Ambien.\n\nIt took months of an excruciatingly slow taper off the Gabs. But it was worth it- for this and other reasons. Just this month when I started taking my Ambien Ive slowly started to notice it properly interacting with my brain. \n\nIts starting to get more and more intense every time I take it. Its all hard to describe really. I just dont feel all there. Not necessarily in a good way or a bad way. \n\nThe one thing today I noticed it especially was the feeling in my body.

About 3 weeks ago, I was admitted to the ER for diverticulitis. Had horrible stomach pains and thought it was something bad that I ate. I ended up having diverticulitis (Im a 28f) and Drs proscribed me antibiotics cipro + flagyl. All of the sudden on day 3 of taking it, My throat swelled and I started sneezing and coughing uncontrollably. I couldnt breathe so I took a Benadryl. I called the Dr immediately and they told me I was having an allergic reaction to the antibiotics and stop taking it immediately. I went back to the Dr the next day and they gave me Augmentin. They additionally gave me prednisone to clear up the allergic reaction. The diverticulitis flare up went away and a few days later I started having normal seasonal allergy symptoms. Its allergy season where I live so I figured seasonal allergies were to blame. A week and a half went by.. and I started having 9/10 level pain in the right side of my face, nose, ears and teeth (upper and lower). I decided to call the Dr on Saturday and he proscribed a Z pack (Azithromycin) for what I believed had turned into a sinus infection. I should also add within that week I would take Motrin 1-2 times a day for sinus pain, Flonase everyday and used a netty pot twice a week. \nIts now Tuesday and day 3 of Azithromycin. The pain is not 9/10 but 7/10. Tylenol and IB profin have not worked for me no matter how much I take so I stopped am just suffering at this point. I went to the ER last night because I started vomiting and shaking and the RN straight up told me what did you think we could do for you? UH IDK.. youre drs and Im sick. She told me to let the antibiotics run its course and prescribed more prednisone and pain killers (norco). I woke up this morning at 2 am with the right side of my face completely numb. I panicked because I thought I maybe had a stroke or something. I havent called the Dr because I dont know what else they could do for me. The facial numbness is terrifying and painful. The Drs seem annoyed at me each time I call. Before my diverticulitis flare up, I never had been to an ER in my life. When I blow my nose, sometimes yellow/green globs of phlegm comes out.. and sometimes it clear. Idk what else to do. Ive cried so many times today and tried everything under the sun to get my face to come back to life (stood in the shower with burning hot water/ steam to unplug myself, hot compresses, hot tea, etc) but its swollen to another level and very tender to the touch. I just took Sudafed to see if it would decongest me a little. Its not working yet and its been about ~30 mins. I dont know what else to do at this point.. and the Drs are no help.'"

codeine side effect,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/11jgyv8/sciatica_2020_now/,b'Sciatica 2020 > now',Image437,"b'I (35 M) am currently really suffering with a flare up of sciatica. I hope by sharing my story I might get some support and advice from fellow sufferers.\n\nI am very active person: football, running, walking. I was out hillwalking in 2020 when I overstretched crossing a burn. I thought Id pulled my hamstring at first, as the pain increased (despite rest) over the next few weeks, I then wondered if the hamstring was torn. Being a somewhat typical man, I hadnt sought medical advice yet\n\nI had to get advice when the pain just became unbearable over the course of another few weeks. I was then prescribed the strongest co-codamol and these helped greatly. I also got referred to physio but decided to take workplace physio as it would be much quicker to get an appointment. I didnt find this very helpful as it was telephone consultations due to the Covid lockdown. I ended up getting a face-to-face consultation with another physio through a football contact and he was fantastic. I was given exercises to strengthen around my glutes, hamstring, hips. These all worked and although progress was slow, I was getting better.\n\nThe physio believed I had some kind of pinch in my nerve due to the way my muscles developed through years of playing sports. I am going to be asking for a general review of this opinion shortly.\n\nBy autumn 2021 I was back playing football and running again.\n\nFast forward to Christmas 2022, out of nowhere, with nothing I can pinpoint, or any warning signs, it came back with a vengeance. Initially, it was manageable, I immediately got referred back to physio. I had a couple of sessions, got a new exercise / stretching regime, some of which Id kept up from 2020 anyway. I even have the same resistance band Id been regularly using from that time for my glute exercises. Recovery seemed to be going well.\n\nHowever, on Tuesday last week, I was walking down the stairs at home and just felt a blinding pain and spasm in my left leg. I had to phone my partner to come home from work early as I couldnt watch my little one safely. The pain was worse than ever, still seeming to emanate from my hamstring, but also in my buttocks, glutes, down my lower leg - the worst pain I have ever experienced. Non prescription pain relief just wasnt having any effect. I wasnt able to do any of my stretches at all either.\n\nIve been off work since and have been so reliant on my partner. I know I am very lucky in that regard. On Tuesday night, I barely slept, the pain just kept me awake and I absolutely took more painkillers than I should have.\n\nWednesday morning, the doctor prescribed Naproxen and strong co-codamol. I felt a difference, particularly during the day, but at night again I was awake at 1am and 5am. I tried sleeping on the couch, the bed, the spare bed, the floor! Pillows under me, between my legs, etc, etc. Lots of googling that night.\n\nThursday, I got a different doctor. He told me to park the cocodamol and try valium and amitriptyline instead. One tablet of amitriptyline didnt really seem to do anything but the valium certainly loosened me up both mentally and physically! It was better, but still not great and I am seeing 4/5am like clockwork every morning. I have also reintroduced cocodamol which the doctor told me I could do, but to be extremely mindful of this due to its interactions with the other medications. I feel fine and have had no side effects, which is a blessing.\n\nOther things I am doing when I can: very light stretching, trying to walk a little every so often, hot baths with salts, deep freeze, deep heat, bags of peas, compression band (joint waist and leg one). \n\nTonight, I am switching my Naproxen to before bed and also taking my amitriptyline then too instead of at 8pm. If I can sleep through the night I will be delighted. I will be phoning the GP at 8am and I have physio on Thursday too, so will be seeking professional advice then too.\n\nIt feels good to get this down in writing - cathartic! Apologies its so long.\n\nI wonder if anyone has experience of similar medications and trying to get their consumption times correct? Also other medication options? As both GPs have asked what I was thinking, and both times I was a bit unprepared for that question!?\n\nAny opinions on CBD based creams? I am not sure if that stuff is snake oil!\n\nAny other hints, tips, and suggestions gratefully received!\n\nThanks for reading\n\nUPDATE: \n\n- After one week of pretty much crippling pain, I woke up in a much better state and so far (4pm) my symptoms are suddenly much milder. Last night was the first night I slept through the night but 30mg of Amitriptyline and 60mg of codeine certainly would have helped that\nI have only taken my anti-inflammatory so far today as a result. I really dont like how the codeine makes me feel and know how dangerous it can be to take these for prolonged periods of time. I am going to walk to the shops shortly, and intend to have a hot bath with salts. I cant pinpoint exactly what might have changed, I have flung the kitchen sink at it, but I am going to keep it all up. I am under no illusions that it may return tomorrow, or next week, etc\nI will take codeine tonight and tomorrow (only one tablet) before bed, as I really cant handle lack of sleep and thats when its at its worst, but I intend (all going well) to take none Friday - Sunday and possibly even return to work on Monday.\nOne day at a time though, and I wont be phased by setbacks thanks to all your help, advice, and support!'"

On May 30, he had a craniotomy for fenestration of the cyst, and since then he has experienced chronic vomiting that's kept us in the hospital. Today he has vomited 15 times, most often a minute or two after he finishes nursing (he's exclusively breastfed) but also sometimes an hour or more after a nursing session. Between vomiting episodes, he is his normal, happy self, and he doesn't appear to have any other symptoms (but he's 7 months old so he can't exactly tell us everything he's feeling). He's had an MRI, abdominal X-ray, CBC, metabolic panel, blood culture, and urinalysis - all unremarkable. Zofran has not made any difference at all in managing his symptoms, and we are currently trying Pepcid and Ativan. His neurosurgeon said he would expect some vomiting after this type of surgery due to the change in pressure in his brain, but one would think the symptoms would be improving at almost 2 weeks post-op.

Every single one of them told me to see a primary care physician for medication; I did. I was prescribed Amoxicillin - Clavulanate 875-125 mg 2x a day for 10 days with 500 mg Naproxen.

I accepted one of the dental appointments I was offered by the 4 offices on April 28th.\n\nI have a few questions.\n\n1. How long should it take for the pain reduction from the Amox-clav to take effect? Day 3 and I've taken 5/20 of the 875-125mg pills and will take the 6th pill later tonight. The pain has done nothing, but increase keeping me awake, I wake up every 10-30 minutes when I doze off from pain. (i also received a shot of Toradol and something else 3 days ago).\n2. What is a good timeframe to realize the antibiotics might not be working and I should go back to see my Primary Care Physician since I can't get any Dentist or Endo to see me within a month?\n3. If the abscess pain ever leaves how long can I expect the infection to stay at bay before becoming painful again since my dental appt isn't until April 28th and nobody will squeeze me in for an emergency\n4. Also I've added on 650 extended release acetaminophen to my 500mg naproxen and it isn't touching this pain at all along with salt water rinses. Is there anything else I can do? This tooth has been RCT for 4 years and a few months.\n5. Should I be draining the abscess myself when it forms a fistula, I've done this twice in 2/3 days of taking my antibiotics. Since no dentist will see me for a month and I have a cheap dental mirror I'm able to look at the abscess, I first noticed the bleeding after brushing my teeth a week ago, then about 2 days later I realize I had pus draining from there.\n6. This is one of the only 2 teeth in my mouth that touch on bite and it SUCKS when I accidentally do it. Is there anyway I can mitigate this until April 28th?\n7. is this common practice to not have emergency dental visits since Covid because I feel so helpless right now after pleading to 4 different offices  how it is keeping me awake.

I don\'t think I did this healthily though, I binge eat 2.5k-4k cals some days, purge, fast and take laxatives (up to 7 at a time!). Maybe my laxative abuse damaged my body because everytime I go #2, I bleed a little.\n\nSome days I had up to 5-600g of carbs, then usually 300-400g, to now, 200-400g.

Currently I'm 24M, weight: 74 kg, height: 175 cm, I don't drink nor smoke at all.\n\nWhen I was 13, for a few months I had been feeling returning pain in my right leg. One day my leg has become swollen and it turned out that I had deep vein thrombosis under my right knee. I was admitted to the hospital and given medication which eventually dissolved the blood clot. I was also tested for antiphospholipid syndrome and it turned out positive. I don't have any other autoimmunological diseases related to it, it's primary APS.\n\nSince that point I've been taking Warfarin every day (9 - 11 mg depending on current INR) and keeping my INR at 2.0 - 3.0 levels. I've never had any new blood clots or other APS symptoms (and hopefully it will remain that way).\n\nAnyways, I've recently wanted to start being more active and I would like to try EMS - Electrical Muscle Stimulation. The idea is that you wear a suit with electrodes that are placed on certain parts of the body. Then you work out with the help of the personal trainer. They send impulses to the electrodes and target muscles which is supposed to increase the effectiveness of the workout.\n\nI'm not asking about the effectiveness of EMS because that's something I would like to test myself. What I'm not sure about is if there are any contraindications for people with APS. I've seen on some EMS studios' websites that thrombosis and blood clotting disorders are contraindications, however they are mentioned only sometimes - and I'm also not sure where lies the danger.\n\nMy doctor allowed me to work out in the gym (unfortunately they don't know what is EMS, that's why I'm asking here) - so what I'm asking is if EMS is more dangerous for people with APS than normal gym trainings. I've seen on a few websites that EMS can lower the risk of blood clots and improve blood flow so it seems counterintuitive to me that it wouldn't be advised for people with blood clotting disorders. Shouldn't it be recommended instead of being discouraged?\n\nAlso one more thing - EMS is advertised as safer alternative to traditional workout which reduces the risk of injury. So once again I'm not sure why would it be something I shouldn't do.\n\nI'm looking for advise from someone who knows what EMS is and knows what APS is. I'd like to try EMS but I don't want to hurt myself."""

NAD.\n\nI wrote in r/eesti about my success in getting our equivalent of the NHS to apply a little-known clause in its bylaw. They covered my sedation for wisdom tooth extractions because I have sometimes had difficulties getting fully numb with local and require more local than is normal. Here sedation dentistry is virtually unknown of, even if they dig around in your jawbones for an hour. Some clinics offer sedation and our equivalent of NHS has to cover it in quite a few situations... but most patients don\'t know about sedation at all, doctors don\'t know when it should be covered and wanting sedation is considered extra. It\'s usually reserved for people with severe developmental disabilities.\n\nI\'m so proud that I pestered the clinics, our equivalent of the NHS and finally even our ministry of social affairs - and not just because I saved some money. I created a useful precedent for patients who can\'t have their teeth extracted without sedation. And I contributed to normalising sedation for dental surgery. I know someone who unlike me can\'t get numb at all and he had his wisdom teeth pulled awake. That\'s barbaric and I\'m doing my best to inform the other patients about their options.\n\nI assume that the nuances of our medical bureaucracy are of little interest to most English-speking readers, but my original post that started as a guide to the bureaucracy got a bit out of hand, and I also wrote about my experience with sedation and recovery. So I decided to translate those parts of my post for the benefit of other highly sensitive patients. A few redditors who are considering extractions seemed to appreciate the level of detail.\n\nSorry for any awkward grammar. If you find some particularly egregious error, I\'d love if you point it out since I\'m trying to improve :)\n\nThis post is long. Even by my standards. I think all of my posts in r/eesti have gotten at least one more or less snarky comment about their length. I want to write about my experience as honestly and vividly as I can.\n\nIf you know someone who has been putting off extracting their problematic wisdom teeth due to abnormally high pain sensitivity or bad dentist experiences then maybe my post can help them get it done while avoiding unpleasant issues during recovery.\n\nI have split this post into two parts - my experience with sedation, and other tips for abnormally sensitive people. I also started both parts with a TLDR and have tried to use some bold font to make it a bit more readable.\n\n**MY EXPERIENCE WITH SEDATION**\n\n**TLDR:** I read that some patients have success with oral anxiolytics or laughing gas but concluded that those aren\'t a good fit and I should go with IV sedation. There was nothing physically unpleasant about sedation and the recovery was quick but waking up under the influence of drugs in a white room with stitches in your mouth can result in some major panic. I do think that sedation was the only reasonable option for me and I would have really regretted doing the operation awake.\n\nI briefly considered an oral anxiolytic. My GP prescribed me alprazolam (Xanax) for dental visits and I used it for the last two fillings. It turned out that the effects of alprazolam on me, at least in the small doses I have tried, are a big fat nothing. I do hope that a more substatial dose or a different drug might help. I\'ll ask my GP or a psychiatrist to help find the right drug and dosage that would take the edge off during normal dental visits. But something as serious and potentially painful as a wisdom tooth extraction is not the time to experiment with a drug that MIGHT eliminate SOME of the problems.\n\nSome clinics offer both laughing gas and IV sedation. I strongly preferred the second option since I\'ve read that IV sedation is better if the patient has extreme anxiety and laughing gas can cause nausea and a headache, especially if you have to breathe it for a whole hour. Fortunately it turned out that my clinic employs only IV sedation.\n\nSedation is much easier than GA. They don\'t intubate you, you breathe independently with a bit of supplemental oxygen that is given non-invasively via some tubing under your nose. I was explained that unlike with GA I won\'t be given any drugs that can cause vomiting after the operation. So if you\'ve heard bad stories about coming out of GA or experienced it for yourself - sedation is different.\n\nDoctors sure are weird. They seemed very invested in making me look away during IV insertion and warned that the drug will burn. Considering why I was there, those seemed to be the least of my problems.\n\nI don\'t remember anything from the moment the IV was inserted and I felt a slight burn and pleasant warmth in my hand. **Going to sleep happened in a couple of seconds and felt very comfy.** I\'ve read that some patients have some fuzzy bits of memories since it\'s not GA, but most aren\'t bothered by it.\n\n**The physical and cognitive part of waking up was easy.** I felt no nausea whatsoever. For the first few minutes I didn\'t feel any pain except the pinch of my IV being removed. I don\'t remember any confusion. My thinking cleared very quickly. When the anesthesiologist was talking to the surgeon and recommended ibuprofen for postop pain I asked whether it\'s safe to take etoricoxib and ibuprofen together since they\'re both cyclooxygenase inhibitors. (The nerd is strong in this one.) When they made me stand up I almost passed out. I started lowering myself towards the floor, and then someone offered me an office chair and wheeled me to the recovery room.\n\nThe psychological part of waking up was a whole other story. **I was crying like crazy even before my pain sensitivity returned.** I woke up in complete panic - I wasn\'t confused or unresponsive, I understood very well what was going on and could hold a reasonable conversation between sobs, but I was extremely afraid and irritated. That happens, especially in younger people, women and those with a history of medical procedure trauma. You shouldn\'t be ashamed, it\'s not under your control. And it\'s certainly nothing compared to what would have happend if I hadn\'t chosen sedation. I\'m mentioning it just so you don\'t have any unpleasant surprises and so that you are kind to yourself if it happens.\n\nOne redditor who has anxiety was put off by this description and it might have influenced him against sedation. **If you are an easy crier or are traumatised by medical procedures you might want to ask if they can wake you up with a family member or friend present** \\- someone\'s got to drive you home anyways. It\'s much harder to tailspin into a panic attack if someone you love is holding your hand and knows what are the right things to tell you when you feel bad. (Telling me to calm down only makes me cry more!)\n\nStill, to reassure you, everything about sedation - except the condescending and irritable attitude of the surgeon, which made the panic attack so much worse - is something that I wouldn\'t be afraid to repeat if it was necessary. Going to sleep was very pleasant. Waking up (when considered separately from postop ick like blood in your mouth and pain - which you would experience anyways) wasn\'t as bad as I expected.\n\nThe fact that sedation is normal in the US for wisdom tooth extractions, and not only for special needs patients, should tell you how safe it is. The fact that here most patients suffer it awake unlike in the US is purely a question of cultural norms and money, not risks.\n\nBy the way, the awful pain a few minutes after waking up tells me that the local failed partially and **doing the operation awake with my history would have been the dumbest idea ever.** Keep in mind that a tooth extraction is difficult to stop once the tooth is broken. If you have any doubts about your ability to let the doctor finish the job while you\'re awake, demand sedation.\n\n**ON CHOOSING THE DOCTOR; ON POSTOP PAIN AND RECOVERY**\n\n**TLDR:** You might be the 1% who can\'t handle it without prescription painkillers and extends your sick leave well into the second week. Speak up before the operation and not when you are already feeling awful and it hurts to speak. Don\'t trust the doctor if they promise to handle pain as it happens and refuse to discuss it preemptively.\n\nThose tips are especially important for a highly sensitive patient. There are things the docs don\'t tell you because, after all, every patient is a statistical average. And the internet is a great evil because if a patient doesn\'t read about the bad experiences they might not notice if it happens to them. \\\\s\n\n\\- **Don\'t take it lightly.** It\'s an hour of digging around in your jawbones and not removing a mole. Recovery can be long and painful even if the operation goes ideally, like mine. Nerve damage can be serious and sometimes, rarely, permanent. Nerve damage can mean a numb lip or tongue, changes in taste perception or even chronic pain. Two of my wisdom teeth had to go because one was trying to grow into the root of the neighboring tooth under a 45-degree angle and the other was a gum infection risk. If some of your wisdom teeth have come in nicely and don\'t hurt, and extraction is recommended only because poor hygiene might result in a cavity ten years later or your orthodontist wants more space to work with, then I\'d seriously ask yourself if it\'s worth so much pain. And don\'t expect the doctor to warn you about the risks adqeuately. The surgeon described the possibility of nerve damage as ""might pull out some nerve fibers"" and if I hadn\'t read up on the internet then I wouldn\'t know what it actually means. I had a successful operation and my IAN is completely intact. But you might have bad luck. I know that in the age of vaccine skepticism and the ivermectin craze this phrase might sound off to some, but still - **do your research.**\n\n\\- **If you decide to do it awake then listen to your gut when consulting with the doc.** Several reviews about teeth pulled without sufficient numbing, treating sedation or an extended sick leave as some kind of a whim and not a necessity, a sour mien if you\'re worried and ask reasonable questions, and an irrational fear of prescription painkillers are all red flags. Considering how the surgeon was talking to me while I was waking up and how she refused to treat my pain, pulling the teeth while awake would have been a terrifying experience. She might be skillful and I\'m glad she saved my IAN during a complicated extraction but in all other respects being treated by her was an experience that undid much of the work I\'d done on my fear thanks to my excellent new dentist.\n\n\\- **Don\'t let them extract teeth from both sides at the same time** unless you want to eat baby food and yogurt for a month and skip candied almonds for one more month. I\'m glad that I decisively refused the surgeon\'s suggestion to pull the third tooth just in case. The side that was operated on might hurt and be useless for a long time. One non-damaged side speeds up the return to a reasonable diet so much.\n\n\\- **Consider the possibility of a longer recovery when you\'re picking the time.** Don\'t assume that if someone you know took two ibuprofen and resumed work the next day then you will too. Keep in mind that your face might look swollen or bruised for a week and speaking even for a very short time might hurt a lot for the first few days. If you are a student, an instructor or a grown-up who has signed up for some fun course then don\'t get your teeth extracted in the middle of the term hoping that you\'ll recover in a couple of days. And don\'t get your teeth extracted less than two weeks before a party that you would be sorry to miss. **I\'m very much disappointed in my stupidity - I assumed that I would be able to go to a concert three days after the operation.** \\#NotAStatisticalAverage\n\n\\- **It\'s better to get it done in the first half of the working week** \\- especially if you\'re optimistic and agree to do it without a preemptive prescription for stronger painkillers. It\'s nice if for the first two or three days you can reach your surgeon or GP by phone at least during daytime. This might spare you a visit to the ER.\n\n\\- **Take sick leave, if you can. As much as you need.** I know that it\'s often challenging or impossible in the US but if it\'s possible, use your sick leave! A code rat doesn\'t deserve any less sick leave than a warehouse worker or a teacher. Be prepared to argue with a doctor or a rude front desk nurse who thinks otherwise. No one should be working in so much pain, even if they can WFH. Mental strain and stress don\'t pull on your incisions but they certainly can make you feel worse. And rest can help you use less painkillers - tell this if a family member or a healthcare worker dares to question your need for a longer sick leave. #NotAStatisticalAverage\n\n\\- **Premedication.** I was given 0.5 g tylenol when I arrived. I should have laughed and told them that I might as well take nothing. If you know from experience that 0.5 g is completely useless for you and you take 1 g even for minor issues or that ibuprofen works better for you or actually you\'d like to take both just in case, then don\'t hesitate to speak up. My second panic attack and a long bout of crying happened in the recovery room just after sedation wore off completely and I understood how much pain I\'m in.\n\n\\- **I was still in an awful amount of pain the next day and the surgeon refused to help me.** I had a prescription COX-2 inhibitor (and I\'m not sure if it did any good - discontinuing it a few days later didn\'t affect my pain much) and OTC tylenol with codeine and ibuprofen. At first those were completely insufficient even when taken all together in maximum doses. I was in so much pain that I couldn\'t drink much water, go to sleep or speak. I took the maximum safe amount of ibuprofen together with the COX-2 inhibitor and because I couldn\'t eat even a decent amount of ice cream I took ibuprofen on an almost empty stomach. (Not a good idea!) You should also consider that the recovery isn\'t linear and you might get some surprisingly nasty pain as a surprise several days later - and Murphy\'s law suggests that it will happen in the evening or on the weekend. **Does your surgeon claim that no one needs opioids for such a ""minor"" thing? That opioids make you drowsy and most patients hate it so much that you shouldn\'t even give it a try? That they will prescribe something stronger but only after the operation, if the need actually arises? RUN.** Don\'t trust that you will get help when you need it. My boyfriend called the surgeon. (I was too sore to speak.) The surgeon told me to meditate and claimed that OTC painkillers aren\'t helping because I don\'t believe in their effectiveness. Fortunately my GP prescribed me tramadol. After I got the pain under control, drank some water and slept the milder painkillers worked much better. Also, while pain isn\'t ""all in your head"" I must admit that having tramadol on hand wasn\'t just good for pain and sleep, it was also a psychological safety blanket that allowed me to cope. I took as little as possible and discontinued it as soon as possible, used less than three pills total and split them, but it was nice having it on my nightstand and thinking ""Yes, it sucks a bit right now. But if it starts sucking more, I can take something stronger anytime I want."" Everybody should know their risks of addiction. Some have an unhealthy attraction to psychoactive stuff, some don\'t. I don\'t. For me, tramadol was very effective against pain and discomfort, that\'s all. Everyone\'s different. #NotAStatisticalAverage\n\n\\- **The best thing you can do to stay comfortable while minimising the use of painkillers and reducing their use as quickly as possible is lots of good sleep.** During the day moderate pain can be ignored with distractions. And you actually want to keep at least a bit of pain during the day to remind you to avoid anything stupid that might disturb the incisions or pull out the blood clot. But that works best if you aren\'t tired and angry after a miserable, sleepless night. If you get your pain fully under control late in the evening and sleep well then next day you\'ll be rested and in a good mood and the total use of painkillers will be greatly reduced.\n\n\\- **If you had a bad experience then ask to book your postop checkup, if you need one, with a different dentist.** My clinic was very understanding about it. The dental surgeon who checked my wounds did his best to not cause any unnecessary pain during the checkup and so graciously kept to himself all the frustrated comments about my sensitivity that were probably going through his head.\n\n\\- Your wound might feel iffy and you might be unsure if it\'s just your hypersensitivity or an infection that requires more antibiotics. **The checkup is another reason why you might need a stronger painkiller.** I timed tylenol, ibuprofen and tramadol so that they all peaked during the checkup. That was sufficient to open my mouth enough to show the wounds. Barely. Nine days after the operation. #NotAStatisticalAverage\n\n\\- The doctor I visited for the checkup suggested flushing the wound. I asked if I can have numbing. He warned that when the tissue is irritated the local doesn\'t work as well. I asked what happens if we don\'t flush the wound. He explained that I don\'t have serious inflammation and the wound will heal, just slower. Because even inspecting the wound hurt despite the doctor\'s best efforts, and caused me to make some funny faces and undignified sounds, I decided that I\'d rather take ibuprofen and avoid chewing on that side a few days longer than let him flush the wound. **If the doctor suggests flushing the wound and you are afraid of it then ask what happens if you don\'t. Maybe it\'s ok to leave as is.** I\'m glad that the doc was honest and took into consideration my sensitivity and not only what would be medically ideal if the patient had a high pain tolerance.\n\n\\- **Please, give feedback**. To the doctor - make them think. To the clinic, as they might want to know if one of their doctors ticked the patient off so much that they\'re badmouthing the place to everyone who will listen. And to the wider public, **because we all deserve not just competent but humane medical treatment.**\n\nTo those who read this chonker of a text to the end - thank you for reading my manifesto about dental care. Know your limits. Don\'t be afraid to ask doctors to employ reasonable and safe accommodations that help you take care of your physical health without causing psychological trauma. Have higher expectations when it comes to bedside manner and both procedural and postoperative pain! You will be helping not only yourself but other patients as well.'"

warfarin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/33fyeu/questions_regarding_treatment_plan/,b'Questions regarding treatment plan.',,"b""I'm a 36 year old male who has never particularly had very good dental hygiene (brush 1-2 times a day, no serious attempts at flossing) nor seen the dentist regularly. I've recently acquired dental insurance so I'm working on trying to fix both of those issues. I've only had the first visit with my dentist , they've taken x-rays and done a physical examination. I've been diagnosed with periodontal disease, though the dentist has said that the bone loss is fairly minor. Unfortunately I haven't gotten a copy of my xrays to post. The teeth themselves seem to be in surprisingly good shape considering the circumstances, only needing a couple small cavities filled.\n\nMy treatment plan consists of a planing/scaling, then filling the cavities that need to be filled. During the first visit, after the x-rays and exams, they said they could actually get the first half of the scaling done immediately and they would schedule a second appointment to get the other half done. I have a few questions regarding this though.\n\n1.) The hygienist that worked on the planing/scaling used what she said was basically a high powered water pick. I've tried to look up information about planing/scaling this way, but I haven't been able to find what equipment would have been used. Is this even a valid procedure? It's possible it was simply an ultrasonic scaler, but I don't remember hearing or feeling any scraping other than the couple of times she used a manual scraper to get some particularly stuck tartar off.\n\n2.) About 12-13 years ago, I had a root canal on tooth 9, and crowns on 8&9 due to abscesses and decay. The dentist used a PFM crowns, with the two fused together. My current dentist wants to replace these because he says the metal seems to be irritating my gums, plus the fact that I can't floss between them as easily due to the fusing. The gum above these two teeth do seem to be more inflamed than the rest of my gums. (Since I've started flossing, the redness has pretty much completely gone away except for teeth 8-11, and has been reduced even on those.) Would replacing these really be worth the trouble/cost of having them removed and new crowns made considering that they're still in good condition?\n\n3.) Not particularly related to my treatment plan, but a factor in my appointments, I'm currently on blood thinners (warfarin/aspirin) due to a hypercoaguable state . During the initial planing/scaling mentioned earlier, there was a considerable amount of bleeding despite my INR being in the therapeutic range. I've had to reschedule my second planing/scaling appointment due to my blood getting too thin from antibiotics I've been taking for a sinus infection. For dentists who have experience treating patients on blood thinners, how much bleeding is to be expected? It looked about like a horror movie after my first appointment, and the hygienist had to constantly soak up blood with gauze and rinse and wipe it away.\n\nThanks to those who took the time to read all that, and doubly so for those who respond. Any help would be appreciated. """
celebrex,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/rd5oct/mystery_illness_multiple_doctors_and_no_answers/,"b'Mystery Illness, Multiple Doctors and No Answers'",,"b""Hi, \n34yo F, 5'4 185lbs, USA \n\nHISTORY: Diagnosed with pcos as a teen. Required a year of fertility medication to achieve each of my 3 pregnancies. I had to have my gal bladder removed following the birth of my first child 8 years ago. After my third child was born I needed a hysterectomy with an anterior and posterior repair (I still have my ovaries). I did pelvic floor rehab and physical therapy for 5 months.  One year later I had to go in for another anterior and posterior repair with the addition of a mesh sling. After surgery the surgeon said the top layer of my stitches from the previous year had torn apart in a way she'd never seen before.  Following surgery I had internal pelvic pain that did not decrease with time. After 3 months I was given lidocaine shots near the mesh and the pain decreased.  I have pretty bad tmj and boneless in my jaw, as well as arthritis in my neck after an injury in my teens and getting rear ended in my early 20s. I was uncomfortable with the idea of pain medication and tried physical therapy, massage, acupressure, and dry needling. None of this relieved the constant neck pain so I underwent an ablation in my C4 and C5. It helped a bit but not a lot so I underwent a second round of the ablation. Pain still continued. I went through two more rounds of ablation, this time at C3. Pain was decreased but still severe. I then had 2 rounds of ablation on my C2 and had significant improvement. I have a history of migraines which were alleviated with botox in my scalp and temples. In my early 20's I suddenly developed a syncope issue related to too much adrenalin/rapid heart rate. This was successfully treated with a beta blocker until my first pregnancy, over the course of my first trimester the syncope issues gradually decreased and disappeared. \nI take 150mg of effexor for depression and anxiety. Prilosec for reflux and esophagus tightness. 60 mg of Vyvanse for ADHD. 200 mg of celebrex for the arthritis. Zyrtec for mild allergies. \n\n\n1 year ago I had rapid weight gain, 20 pounds in 3 weeks, with no change in diet. I was incredibly fatigued and could not stay awake. I had widespread pain in my joints and limbs and felt very weak. My focus and mental capabilities felt diminished and I had severe mood swings that seemed random and unrelated to my environment and experiences.  Before this started I jogged for 45 min followed by light weight lifting and strength training for 20-30 min 5 days a week. When the symptoms started I was 145lbs and had been slowly losing baby weight over the course of the year. \n\n\nI went to my GP, he said all my labs and blood work looked normal except for saying it showed I possibly had an autoimmune disorder, though he didn't know what kind. \nHe referred me to a rheumatologist. While waiting for my rheumatologist appointment (they could not get me on the schedule for over 3 months) I sought the opinion of another GP.  They also ran many labs and bloodwork which came back normal, except for low vitamin D, and told me to lose weight and prescribed 1 dose of a vitamin D pill per week. They suggested I try keto and intermittent fasting. I cut calories down to 1200 a day and my symptoms and weight gain did not improve. I continued gaining weight, just at a slower rate. At a follow- up appointment they suggested a stricter diet. I switched to a whole food vegan diet and 1000 calories per day and my weight continued to gain and my symptoms did not decrease. Next I tried a 600 calorie per day liquid diet and the weight gain slowed a little more but still continued. \n\n\nAt the rheumatologist appointment he couldn't see anything out of the ordinary and asked why they'd even referred me to his office. He ran more bloodwork and labs and said they all looked normal. \n\n\nAt this point I requested a referral to an endocrinologist. In the months it took to get an appointment I adapted to the symptoms and found a way to still live life with these symptoms because I am not in a position where I can take days off. I went back to a more typical eating plan but cut portion sizes because I felt much worse on the low calorie, vegan, and intermittent fasting eating plans. My weight gain increased with this change, daily calorie intake was between 1400 and 1600. \n\n\nThe endocrinologist tested me for cushings, hashimotos, and well as extensive bloodwork. All the results came back normal. \n\n\nI found another endocrinologist to see if they could find any answers and after many labs and more bloodwork all she found was a slight glucose intolerance (likely due to my pcos which was diagnosed as a teen) and prescribed metformin.  They said my all my thyroid and cortisol levels look good and that this is all from the glucose intolerance and said to follow up in 3 months of metformin. \n\n\nI have noticed a slight increase in my energy levels, fatigue, and mental clarity, but only slightly. My weight is still climbing even though I am eating 1 serving of flaxseed oatmeal for breakfast, 1-2 cups of greens and 3 oz of grilled chicken breast for lunch and dinner. Though I do sometimes have a small piece or two of dark chocolate in the afternoon or evening. \n\n\nI do not feel like myself at all. I feel tired, weak, grumpy, and less intelligent. I typically am a positive and energetic person . My quality of life has significantly declined. \n\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations, advice, ideas, suggestions, etc? Or a suggestion on what specialty branch of medicine I should try? \n\n\nThank you in advance.\nEdited to include labwork. \n\n[labwork](https://imgur.com/a/8iauRbY)"""

Common trends.',,"b'No hate I swear and not targeted at any individual at all but come on guys, some people here are just showing themselves up. \n\nPeople are absolutely testing the limits of the age old phrase of theres no such thing as a stupid question. \n\nWanting to start a thread of those oh so common things that people continue to post and ask about, in the hopes that people read first rather than repeatedly ask the same questions. \n\nAs a side note though, hope everyones journey isnt being too brutal and that we all will be out the other side of this asap. \n\nIll go first though:\n\n- Yes, taking Accutane is likely to make your skin worse at first. This is normal. It doesnt happen to everyone. It might happen for shorter or longer periods of time. Theres nothing to predict how long your purge will last. You may find that you purge in places that you didnt previously have acne. Again normal. \n\n- You arent going to die if you drink alcohol. And no, the medicine will continue to work. You should of course try and restrict how much you drink as Accutane can affect peoples liver. Just use your brain. If you have an absolute bender one night, thats okay. Drink some water and move on. You will survive. \n\n- Im taking 5mg once a month (not literally). Yeah its probably not going to work wonders. Although there is often method in the madness, talk to your Derm about what their long term plan is for you and dont bother asking on here. \n\n- Yes that rash on your hand is probably from Accutane. Get some moisturiser on it and crack on. \n\n- Ive been taking Accutane for a week and Ive still got spots. Of course you do. Your skin cycle is at least a month normally (although this is being sped up by taking Accutane) so you are very unlikely to experience immediate results. Some people do see changes quickly, others take half a year before they even see any changes. Again, it all relative. Keep going or dont, its up to you. \n\n- I weigh three stone and Im on 200mg per day, is this too much. Aye yeah of course it is.  Youre going to end up like a raisin Im sure. Probably worth talking to your Derm. \n\n- Yes, dry lips are normal and are to be expected. Stick some aquaphor on and move on. If that doesnt work for you try something else. \n\n- Ive just spent three hours on a sun bed trying to go brown for my hols, should I be worried? Yes of course you should. You are so much more likely to burn than you would have been before taking Accutane. Why are you spending all this time and effort trying to fix your skin and then actively trying to damage it a different way? Seems counterintuitive. Have a summer off. \n\nWhat have I missed? \n\nAgain, its all in jest but come on guys. '"

(LONG - sorry :( <3)',,"b""Hello kind people of Reddit!\n\n-----I am worried about my deteriorating health but don't want my doctor to feel like I am a crazy person (even if I definitely feel like a crazy person right now). I recently had a vitamin D lab done & they told me I had lipemia so I couldn't get actual results - this has happened before. My GI says it's likely my triglycerides are super high again but neither she nor my PCP know the cause. I've never had full blown pancreatitis or gallstones - just sludge in my GB 2 times in my life, & both times were because of a week long stressful event where I basically didn't cook  & ate out 1-2x/day & I have a lot of food allergies so I assume all the trigger foods for that long did something to me. However, I am eating clean now, completely avoiding trigger foods & I'm worried my triglycerides are high again but this time it's scary for me because I've been eating clean :( \n\n-----I am 33F, BMI 24 (I am working on losing weight doing OMAD). I dont drink or smoke, never have. I have the following known conditions:\n+Fibromyalgia (FMS) - I'll sleep 9-10 hours & still wake up super stiff & achy with muscle spasms & exhausted all day with brain fog, like no short-term memory to speak of\n+IBS-D - likely from BAM as a source\n+Bile Acid Malabsorption (BAM) w/ smelly rancid stools - TMI I know, I'm sorry :( & if I miss my BAM meds, I see dark orange stuff at the bottom of the bowl (I assume they are bile salts/acids?)\n+Interstitial Cystitis (IC) - hurts when I pee a lot but no UTI found ever\n+Many Seasonal (5 types) & Food Allergies (3)\n+Lots of Food Sensitivities & Intolerances (6-8)\n+Leaky Gut - confirmed through a special 3 day GI stool test\n+Avascular Necrosis (AVN) in both my hip joints - I've had 1 THR surgery already because the blood vessels dying caused the bone to collapse on itself & the other one is on its way there with osteoarthritis present already\n+General Anxiety Disorder - but mild, I take meds as needed not daily. No depression, my life is pretty easy peasey. We are very fortunate\n+My joints hurt sometimes when I eat food I shouldn't - I tested negative for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) though\n+My hands and feet also swell when I eat food I shouldn't - to where I have to use a larger sized set of dish washing gloves or not wear closed toe shoes for a bit\n+Preventricular Contractions (PVC) w/ tachycardia w/ arrhythmias (like my heart is skipping beats) & syncope/fainting throughout my life when my Blood Pressure (BP) drops - usually accompanied by pale clammy face & skin, cold sweats, voiding of bowels (both ends), little to no urine, chest & arm pain or numbness & graying vision when I finally do passout\n+Also, may or may not be related to PVC (Im not sure) echocardiogram found small amounts of regurgitation & backflow in my heart due to thickened mitral valves (my cardiologist always told me I was healthy & normal because I have no risk factors despite my PVC & faulty valves & basically just thinks its anxiety, NOT my heart conditions, that trigger my syncope, however, Ive had panic attacks before & those symptoms are completely different - I get super hot instead of cold sweating like I want to take my clothes off, my face & lips dont turn blue at all, my BP goes up not down, my HR goes up but its never irregular & Ive never passed out from a panic attack ever) - I am very petite & sound like I am 10 so I can understand why doctors dont generally take me seriously\n+I get random localized rashes every 3-5 years, basically since childhood, that require steroids to go away but doctors can never tell what the causes are (idiopathic) as theyre only ever just on my arms, my legs, neck or just around my belly button. Never my torso or face & never all over my entire body at once. \n\n-----My liver & kidney labs come in normal each year. There are sometimes abnormal values suggesting some type of anemia but the PCP never really goes anywhere with it as it doesnt happen every year & different things go up & down each time, & since she's not concerned I don't get concerned. My electrolytes & minerals also come back normal. \n\n-----Ive had a couple salivary & urine cortisol labs done in 11/2019 that were high (waking was 4.3, CAR Rise was 95.35% and CAR Decline was 202.3%) & then other times its normal. My ACTH was high (self-ordered lab 106 but another time it was 46) and my GH seemed low (also self-ordered 0.2). My dopamine was 230, norepinephrine was 17.1, glycine was 678, phenethylamine (PEA) was 17 & creatine was 87. My last thyroid panel showed a high 12.5 total T4 value but everything else was normal. I got both adrenal & thyroid testing done because Cushings, Addisons & Hashimotos runs in my family (grand parents). However, based on my labs coming back more often than not in the normal ranges my endocrinologist basically told me Im fine & that adrenal fatigue also isnt a real thing basically. I went to see her to see if maybe the random rashes could be caused by some type or hormonal thing but she said it was unlikely.\n\n-----The last time I had sludge in my GB was in 7/2017 where I had to go to the ER I was in so much pain, they couldnt really find anything in the CT scan, but notes said, subtle retroperitoneal edema/fluid as above. It also says the pancreas, liver, spleen, appendix, ovaries and duodenum appeared unremarkable and there were no nodules by my adrenal glands. They thought it couldve been an acute pancreatitis attack but that maybe it was passing already by the time I got there as nothing really showed up in the CT and then just gave me some dilaudid and then sent me home. I was on a liquid diet for 2 days as the pain would come back after eating actual food, & then it just went away completely. Ive had this pain 2 times, the 1st time we went to UC and the 2nd time (mentioned here) I went to the ER. Triglycerides at this time was 97. Creatine at this time was 0.38, T Bili <0.15, BUN/Creat ratio was 34.2, WBC 12.2, HGB 14, MCH 30.7, NCHC 35.9, RDW SD 36.8, Monocyte 13.7%, Basophil 0.2%, Absolute Neutrophil Count 7.91, Mono Absolute 1.7, Lipase 108, Total Cholesterol 405, Triglycerides 3360, HDL 42, VLDL 672, Chol/HDL 10. I cant seem to find my labs from the 1st time this happened but I think that 1st time the Triglycerides were only like over 500 that time (a year prior). \n\n-----I grew up taking a bunch of antibiotics because my parents didnt want us to stay home from school because that meant theyd have to watch us & they didnt have time for that since they ran their own business (we are Southeast Asian). \n\n-----If youve made it this far, thank you! You are a trooper & the hero I desperately need right now :) While I understand all these things may not be related, I wanted to see if maybe someone somewhere in the world has seen these things before & can help me figure out what is wrong so I can begin to fix it! I just want to somehow stop my body from betraying me :( My main concern is the super high triglycerides. I am eating clean right now, stress free & am worried about the recent vitamin D lab that was unable to get results due to lipemia. Im doing another fasting metabolic & lipid panel on Monday so its going to be a while before I get those results. \n\n-----I guess my question is, what could be causing all these abnormal values? I looked online & from the list of causes for high triglycerides I think lymphedema sounds likely, maybe amyloidosis, maybe Gaucher disease but I am NAD & dont want my PCP to think I am crazy for asking her if I might have any of these random things, but based on the symptoms lists they sound similar to what have experienced. It could also be something else entirely! I just dont know what I dont know! I cant see my functional medicine MD until July; I just dont even know where to go from here & would love some kind of guidance or any other information anyone can give me, really. Thank you so much, reddit, for taking the time to help me out. I cannot possibly say that enough. I dont know what I would ever do without you. You guys are the best! <3"""

November 22 I developed an itchy rash on the back of my neck which soon spread to my shoulders, back and eventually my face/ears/scalp. I work in TRAUMA/ER and the only thing I could think of was a recent exposure to a homeless woman that we believed to have scabies and some sort of visible lice or bugs all over her. Unfortunately, she did not survive so follow up at the onset of my symptoms was not available. I was treated for scabies with permethrin x 3 as well as lice shampoo. Symptoms temporarily subsided and then returned in the same spots and other places. 20 years in the hospital and prehospital setting I had never experienced anyhting of this nature, I was so freaked out that I bought a new bed,new bedding, rugs and drapes. I steamed and deconned other furniture, had air ducts cleaned,bombed my house and car multiple times, washed and bagged every item possible, you name it ....I did it, did a second round of topical permethrin x 2, sulfa baths etc. Things mellowed out leaving areas that resembled mosquito like bites with dark spots in the middle that would come back after a week or so plus new ones. I went to derm and they acted like I was crazy, standing so far away from me I don\'t know how she was able to evaluate eventually telling me contact dermatitis. Offering triamcinalone, keflex and benedryl. I started crying and she eventually said ""fine, Ill give you ivermectin and that will be like an atomic bomb!"" She prescribed one time dose and sent me on my way, they never discussed or called me for follow up lol. After ivermectin things got worse, flaking and bareley improving. I was done with derm and employee health at this point. My PMD did telemed apt and told me to stop steroid, start doxy, permethrin again and 6 more doses of ivermectin. I had about 3 weeks of minor improvement. I had them everywhere at this point in different stages mostly dark outer areas with small dots in the middle or new spots. I am currently off meds for 2 weeks and still having new eruptions. I have been researching everything and am thinking this may be fungalall along as the patient very well could have had ring worm or something of that nature. I am not immunocomprimised, do not drink etoh or use drugs, no medical hx alleric to cipro and take lexapro and doxy now. The photos I have found are very similar to what I thought was scabies or post scabies. Thoughts?'"

Coughing so hard I often cant breath or end up choking on phlegm. Have thrown up/coughed up blood as well (always bright red streaks in phlegm). I am unable to sleep for more than 3-4 hours before I wake up coughing. Sometimes I can feel a wheeze when breathing in, sometimes it feels like something is catching in my throat. My chest does not hurt when breathing deeply (or at all), however I find laughing/yawning/making any sudden or loud noises triggers my cough. \n\nFirst clinic visit I was told it was a combination of asthma, a cold, and my lungs healing from quitting smoking.

It turns out I probably never needed any of these antibiotics because I dont have any kidney or bladder issues and instead have a pelvic floor issue.  \n\nAnyway, I got oral thrush. I never had a problem with thrush before and I never even had a yeast infection before. I was given two weeks of clotrimazole troches. The troches did make a big improvement but by two weeks the thrush was still there along the back of my tongue in small patches. \n\nI started swishing with salt water and scrubbing my tongue with salt. Recently Ive changed to hydrogen peroxide. Ive been diluting it with water and swishing & gargling. I also brush my teeth 2 times a day with a hydrogen peroxide/baking soda tooth paste.

The bottom right was impacted and completely horizontal with the top of it facing outward in my mouth while the bottom left was impacted and the roots were very close to a nerve (surgeon said he was able to remove the roots no problem despite this). I was in normal expected pain for several days taking my antibiotic/800mg ibuprofen/acetaminophen-codeine #3. However on Saturday morning I was in such excruciating pain (acetaminophen-codeine #3 AND old non-expired prescribed Norco from my kidney stones did NOTHING to help) I ended up passing out because of it.\nThen things seemed to turn a corner and I was able to manage my pain with just the ibuprofen until Sunday night/early Monday morning when the excruciating pain came back. My mom called the oral surgeon who told me to take 1000mg Tylenol followed by 800mg ibuprofen two hours later (it made me fall asleep and I woke up feeling much better). The excruciating pain came back later that night and the same regimen did nothing to help. Met with oral surgeon the next morning who took another X-ray, removed sutures, said I had no infection/no dry socket and I was almost completely healed with minimal inflammation. He thought by the way I was grabbing my face in pain/crying that it was muscle spasms so he prescribed 10 10mg Valium and told me to continue the Tylenol/ibuprofen regimen with moist heat no ice. He said if that doesnt work after a week he has no idea how to help me. Took Valium/Tylenol an hour later and after an hour passed out. Eventually woke up later feeling amazing until the excruciating pain came back several hours later.\nThe excruciating pain that makes me wish I was dead (not actually but you know what I mean) still happens after the Valium wears off/every time I wake up and Im beginning to lose hope that this pain will ever go away. Valium no longer makes me fall asleep (just dizzy) and still leaves some pain that is constant but manageable.\nI can barely open my mouth enough to stick two fingers in vertically without sharp pain in the spot my upper and lower jaw meet. Pain is sharp from temple/ears all the way down lower jaw to my chin on both sides and there is a deep ache in my lower teeth/gums/down the front of my neck/behind my eyes. Lymph nodes in neck are extremely swollen still.

Out of the 7 previous teeth Ive had pulled, 4 have ended up with dry sockets (one of them was even an upper, which I know is not common). And here is possibly number 5 out of 8. \nIn addition to all those dry sockets, my first ever extraction experience led me to 6 weeks of incredible pain at the age of 22 due to osteomyelitis. \nSo needless to say, I have been terrified to get this most recent needed extraction (failed root canal). I planned it all out for months. My husband took time off of work to take care of the kids (and me), I quit smoking last October but just quit vaping 2 days before the procedure. I havent had a drop of alcohol. I have only eaten soft food (soup, yogurt, pudding and applesauce). I have been sleeping with my mouth open (since I clench at night, I usually create a vacuum in my mouth so I figured that might be the problem). I have done everything right. AND the blood clot is still in place from what I can tell. This pain is throbbing, and it seems to have progressively gotten worse after day one. Both ears feel like they are being pulled down, like a ton of pressure- but that started day one. My jaw now feels like its throbbing pain, and while the meds seem to help, its only for about an hour. The pain is much worse upon waking up just now, which is 6 hours after my last dose of hydrocodone/acetaminophen. That was the second time I took that kind, and I got super nauseous so I wont be taking that again. Other than that Ive been alternating ibuprofen and Tylenol, but I take one, it takes an hour to kick in, and then the pain relief is already fading an hour and a half later. \nMy question is, could this be a dry socket even if the blood clot was not disturbed? My oral surgeon put me on a course of z-pack, but could this instead be an infection?\nI plan to call in the morning, but Im just dumbfounded. \n\nMore in depth history: My lower wisdom tooth removal turned dry socket and then turned osteomyelitis on one side. The oral surgeon had no idea what was happening. He pulled out a piece of bone thinking that may have been the cause of the pain. Then he ended up pulling the tooth in front of that extraction site which had been a successful root canal. (Surprisingly I did NOT get a dry socket that time - the only lower tooth extraction to not end with a dry socket). Then he gave up and referred me to a different oral surgeon - who took one look and said osteomyelitis, put me on vioxx and some strong antibiotic and I was better in a week.'"

I feel the need to go through some background information and provide enough detail to give everyone a full understanding of my skin situation. If I need to clear anything up, please let me know. \nThank you! \n\n I need help identifying what is going on with my skin. Im experiencing a new stage of stubborn issues after entering a new decade of my life. After doing a lot of research, I came up with an educated guess that the dots on my nose, cheeks, and chin are not blackheads at all they are sebaceous filaments. \n\nDuring puberty, I dealt with moderately severe cystic acne. Junior year of high school, when my acne was beginning to level off, I developed what I thought were multiple blackheads on my t-zone area. Tons of picking and spa facials ensued. They always seemed to come back the next day. I went to a couple of dermatologists but left without an analyzation of my skin and no clear answer other than a benzoyl peroxide recommendation. \n\nI used benzoyl peroxide before when my acne was at its peak much earlier. It cleared up just about everything. Unfortunately, the positive effects wore off and pimples popped back up. \nI tried changing my routine and applying it on certain days, but nothing worked. It wasnt effective anymore. The dermatologists recommendation was not taken. \n\nDuring junior year, I also randomly developed tiny closed comedones all over my forehead. I went to my physician and she prescribed me an antibiotic called azithromycin since she assumed it may be a fungal infection. She was right! The antibiotic not only got rid of the infection, it cleared up my skin too. No pimples, no blackheads, and best of all, no sebaceous filaments. During that time, I worked out everyday and started a new skincare regimen using an acne line from Platinum Skincare. My skin had never been so clear and tight since middle school. The effects lasted for over a year post three months of azithromycin.It was beautiful and I felt very confident in myself.\n\nOf course, just like anything else, all good things must come to an end eventually. \nSince freshman year of college, I havent had to deal with cystic acne other than the occasional hormonal pimples, but my sebaceous filaments have overtaken most of my body. It began with my face then slowly began to work itself down to my chest and back. Ive tried different products from different skincare lines and introduced retinol and retinoid into my routine. I gave each of them separate time to see a difference (nothing happened, good or bad). \n\nHeres the list of every regime and products that were used in each. If I need to provide a more detailed account, I am happy to do so. \n\n#1. \n CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser \n(For normal to oily skin) \n 0.1% Differin Gel \n CeraVe Moisturizing Cream \n\nAfter using differin gel for 6+ months, \nI didnt see an improvement so I switched to using CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum. \nNo improvement or adverse effects. \n\n#2. \n YourGoodSkin (YGS) Revitalizing Foaming Wash\n YGS Pore Minimizing Tonic \n YGS Balancing Skin Concentrate \n Dapsone Gel after finishing Erythromycin antibiotic (neither were effective) \n YGS SPF-30 Anti-Oxidant Day Cream \n YGS ProVitamin Overnight Cream \n\n#3. \n AcneFree 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide Cleanser applied in the morning \n YGS SPF-30 Day Cream\n CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser applied at night \n CeraVe Salicylic Moisturizing Cream applied to face (and body after shower) \n\nThis fourth regime is the one Im at right now: \n\n#4. \n Platinum Skincare (PS) AB Cleanser \n PS Advanced Clarifying Toner \n The Ordinary (TO) 23% Vitamin C Suspension\n TO 10% Niacinamide + 1% Zinc \n TO 30% AHA + 2% BHA solution once or twice a week \n PS Vitamin B Cream \n La Roche-Posay SPF-60 Dry Touch Sunscreen \n\nIts a lot to go through, I know. \n\nI dont know whats happening to my skin and what Im doing wrong. At the end of last year, I switched to a non-hormonal form of birth control, but the sebaceous filaments and all-over oiliness have been around for almost two years so far. Hormones could definitely be making it worse, though Im not 100% sure its the main culprit. \n\nIm considering re-introducing Differin Gel \nor Resurfacing Retinol Serum into my current routine. Though I dont know if either would be effective depending on how they interact with the products. \n\nI also have a Doxycycline antibiotic prescription and another bottle of Dapsone Gel. Does doxycycline help with sebaceous filaments? If so, I may consider taking it. \nShould I use dapsone gel while Im on it or after I finish the antibiotic? \n\nIm very lost and confused with my skin. \nIt seems to be in a new phase where I dont know how to properly take care of it and what products to use.

I have struggled with anxiety for a long time, but the last two weeks its taken a turn for the absolute worst, and I am trying to look for some feedback/input.\n\nI was given Bactrim for 3 days for a UTI.  After taking the pills, I would get panic attacks, anxiety, started being really OCD about side effects and whatnot.  I developed mouth ulcers to the point I could not eat, that have thus healed.  My doctor said it could\'ve been an allergy to the Bactrim, but I think it was stress-induced.  Anyway, I began to experience racing heart, heart palpitations, panic attacks a few days after the Bactrim course.  \n\nMy doctor does not think it would still be affecting me since the drug has long left my system.  But something isn\'t right, and I am starting to wonder if it is my Trazodone.  I began taking it about 45 days ago, 25mg, sometimes 50mg, and wasn\'t affected by it, but it is my understanding that meds like trazodone take a few weeks to ""build up"" and start affecting neurotransmitters like serotonin, etc.\n\nI also take Vyvanse, but it is a low dosage (30mg) and I have been on it for months, with only mild increases in anxiety/heart rate.  \n\nNow, when I take my heart rate first thing in the morning, before any coffee or vyvanse, it is always over 100, and some days was even up to 145.  I\'ve developed a super sensitivity to stimulants, and had to drastically decrease my caffeine intake, and give up the occasional vaping due to my heart racing so bad and having so much anxiety.\n\nSide note: yes, i have gotten an EKG done and it is normal.  I am starting to think this could be trazodone, as i know with other antidepressants in the past they have increased anxiety and made me feel ""stimulated,"" and i know trazodone is not a traditional SSRI, but it still affects serotonin.\n\nAny feed back is appreciated!  also, the trazodone does make me go to sleep.  the anxiety and heart palpitations start in the morning and go on all day.  I am at my wit\'s end, and have had to take a benzo for the first time in 5 years, for the last week.  I have convinced myself that I somehow ruined my system with Bactrim, and am hoping this could just go away by discontinuing the trazodone.'"

Ive taken 400mg of ibuprofen and 500mg of Tylenol together as reccommended by the Endodontist.\n\nIn a seperate occasion, Ive been prescribed a muscle relaxant Baclofen (10mg) for bruxism. I dont grind my teeth much, but I clench incredibly hard. Ive already taken one pill several hours ago. It hasnt made me even the tiniest bit drowsy. I began to fall asleep out of pure exhaustion, but as soon as I was starting to doze off my teeth clicked together. I didnt even clench tightly, and it was awful. Intensely painful. Its unbearable. It is 100% not working.\n\nI rarely take the Baclofen. The last time was probably several months ago, and never more than a couple nights in a row. The first times I remember taking the muscle relaxant, it made me super drowsy very rapidly. My heart rate decreased. I could easily tell it was working. More so than any other medicine Ive taken. I do not see how I could have built a tolerance for the drug when its so seldom used as well.\n\nSo why is the Baclofen not working? Expiry date is listed as 08/24/2023. Can I take another pill? If not, why? I have already googled this of course. It just said to only take as prescribed, without explaining why it is bad or if in extenuating circumstances it can be done.

Advil problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/nnulwt/accutane_results_what_worked_for_me/,b'Accutane results + what worked for me!',"Image570.jpg, Image571.jpg, Image572.jpg","b""Hello!\n\nI've read this subreddit for my entire accutane journey so now that it's two weeks from coming to a close, I thought i'd do a post in hopes of helping others with all my side effects and what worked for me!\n\nI (26F, 155lbs) started a five month course of Accutane in January (40-80-80-80-80). Before I started, I made a point to try to repair the moisture barrier of my *entire body*. I bought Aveeno moisturizing shower wash with a loofah on a stick (to reach my back) and put the cerave in a tub on my whole body after every shower for about two weeks prior. I really think this helped, because my body was not dry for almost my entire treatment! I kept this habit up the entire five months.\n\nWhen I started, my first side effect was dry scalp. It was SO itchy and flakey! My local pharmacist recommended that for the duration of my treatment, I should use a baby shampoo (he recommended Cerave) and a paraben-free conditioner. The baby shampoo was a godsend! Like all Cerave products, it has ceramides to help with hydration. Your scalp is skin just like the rest of your body, so it needs hydration too!\n\nThis took care of the scalp problem 100%. I was concerned about hair loss prior to accutane since I was ALREADY losing hair before starting, but I actually saw hair growth during my treatment! This is because the extreme oil that was always in my hair weighed it down and made it fall. Take that away, hydrate the skin properly, and my mini bald spots filled in!\n\nTiredness also hit me hard in the beginning and the only thing that really helped was drinking my bodyweight in water. But even with that, the exhaustion was hard to beat. I would say this was my second to most severe side effect.\n\nDry lips were not a huge side effect for me, surprisingly enough! Towards my final two months I looked a bit like the Joker with tears on both sides of my lips, but the lips themselves didn't really crack during the treatment. I put hyaluronic acid on my slightly damp lips, waited 2 minutes, then put LRP Cicaplast, topped by aquaphor to lock it all in.\n\nMy skin would only get dry and flake if I failed to do my skincare routine (which did occasionally happen out of the exhaustion mentioned above). But, if I did do it, my skin was smooth!\n\nRoutine:\n\nAM:- Wash face with water- Cerave hyaluronic acid serum- The Ordinary moisturizer- LRP Anthelios sunscreen SPF 60\n\nAfternoon:- Wash face with Cerave hydrating facial cleanser- The Ordinary hyaluronic acid- The Ordinary Niacimide (A note on this--my skin has always been the type to survive anything. I told myself I'd keep this in my routine to help with scarring but if ever it burned, I'd stop. It never did, so I used it the whole treatment!)- LRP Lipikar Balm AP\n\nEvening:- Wipe face with Avene extremely gentle cleanser lotion on cotton pad- Cerave PM skin renewing night cream\n\nI never suffered a nosebleed but I did suffer from leaky nostrils and a sweaty upper lip. To deal with the leaky nostrils, in the morning and at night I did a saline spray, followed by Nozoil (hydrating sesame oil spray) and then a product called Secaris applied with a q-tip.\n\nThe major side effect I had that was a literal pain was lower back pain. I have always had a terrible posture and knew I would hit this problem eventually, but Accutane really sped that process up. I would wake up EVERY morning with a lower back so sore that I couldn't stay in one position for more than 5 minutes. On bad nights, the back pain would wake me up and I would have to get out of bed to walk around and stretch.\n\nThis went away during the day unless I sat in a stupid position for a long time.\n\nWhat helped a lot was getting a side sleeper knee pillow on Amazon. It helps with the alignment of your spine as you sleep, so it took a lot of pressure off my back. It didn't cure the problem, but it helped. I also got a back belt that I wore during the day to help keep my core muscles engaged. On days where I worked my core either through exercise or with the belt, the overnight pain was drastically reduced.\n\nThere was awhile where I would put Voltaren Emulgel on my lower back before going to bed every night to prevent the pain, but I tried to stop doing that. Instead I keep advil on my nighstand and if I wake up with pain, I take 3.\n\nRegarding the purge: I thought I would escape it, silly me. It started about 2 months in for me and lasted until about the start of month 4, but I still got new pimples at the end of month 4. I talked to my derm about prolonging my treatment since I wasn't 100% clear, but I will have hit my cumulative dose and he's not comfortable continuing. Instead he made an appointment for me one month after I stop, to see what happens and to determine further treatment going forward. In the end, I would say I have been completely clear since week 1 of month 5 (and I am currently on week 2.5).\n\nI saw the viral TikTok about noses shrinking on Accutane and naturally compared my nose before and after. It shrunk a little. Out of curiosity, I asked my derm about it! He said that noses don't actually shrink, but that people who take Accutane tend to suffer from chronic inflammation of the face. Take away that inflammation and your features will look smaller! So if this has happened to you, welcome to your regular-sized nose. :)\n\nThat's about all that I can think of off the top of my head! I'd be glad to answer any questions if anyone has.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kojzlqtyw3271.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=948d8030f5a20c9645bd50396dec4c95fc282646\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/syipmztyw3271.jpg?width=2320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3aa277d264b964cb58b9dbfd5d29bc08da6b5361\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8xoroztyw3271.jpg?width=2320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5e5c7c0830db1a1c1b0f555c08ed878c98bbe507"""

However, after I fell ill last summer I went to the doctor and she believed that I had celiac, blood work came back negative and I never got a biopsy. At this point, I believe it\'s just an intolerance or sensitivity to gluten.\nCurrent medications: No, but I went to the ER for this before and they believed to be a UIT (after finding blood in urine) and was prescribed some antibiotics that had NO effect. I also took Advil and Acetaminophen and they both had very minimal (if any) effect. Went to the doctor, more tests, went to a walk in clinic and prescribed another antibiotic, no effect. Went to the ER and was given a laxative after my Xray showed severe constipation. Currently waiting on a prescription to help ease the pain (buscopan), but it\'s out of stock. \n\n\nMy CT scan couldn\'t see a lot of things so was inconclusive. I have a colonoscopy and endoscopy coming up.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n- Bloody diarrhea or very mushy feces after every meal (some black and red bits, and some pieces float)\n- Occasional constipation (it can go from diarrhea to constipation)\n- Nausea\n- Fatigue (I always sleep until 2:00, no matter what time I go to bed)\n- Vomit in mouth - sometimes have to spit it out\n- Swollen lymph node noted on CT scan as lymphadenopathy. This lymph node is extremely painful\n- Weakness\n- Eye floaters\n- Gas\n- Loud gurgling and other weird noises from stomach\n- Painful feet and clubbed nails on toes. As this has progressed, more nails have started clubbing. (Horizontal ridges as well)\n- Extreme abdomen pain. (Can be like a knife, clenching, biting, fire, etc.) My pain has gone from occasional to constant, but extreme pain will \'flare up\' and last a few seconds. \n- Bloating\n- Tender stomach\n- A fever\n- Chest pain\n- Back pain\n- Headaches\n- Poor appetite\n- Dry lips\n- Itchiness with occasional blotches\n- The pain is getting much worse, and I have no pain killers that work. This week has been the worst week yet. \n- Constantly feel like I need to have a bowel movement\n- Can barely walk from the pain\n- Numbing in hands\n- Brain fog and extreme fatigue (like I lose all my energy after eating)\n- Gassy, I belch after every meal\n- Severe pain in rectum (occasionally burns)\n- When it first started, I had a low WBC, but that seems to have fixed itself.\n- Dehydration noted in my blood work.\n- Out of breath, trouble getting air.\n- Also, some other irregularities in my blood work, can\'t remember, though.\n- There are more symptoms, but this is all I can think of now\n\nOkay, so those are all the symptoms that I think are related.

I feel like something was triggered when I had all the craziness going on after a surgery. Ive had some things for years but things really started accelerating after an L4-L5 discectomy and laminotomy. I dont know what is related and what isnt. I had really strange symptoms including nightly fevers for a while and was tested throughly- oncologist, rheumatologist, infectious disease specialist. I feel like they were very thorough. They did all the relevant blood work. I have worried about fibromyalgia because I know it would not have shown up on the test. I know there are also several other auto immune diseases that can possibly not show up or take a long time.  They found a few small anomalies like liver enzymes imbalances, but nothing to get any diagnosis. My primary care provider kind of threw her hands up and said maybe your dealing with some weird viral thing.

codeine vomit,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/kmreag/severe_persistent_cough_for_6_weeks_now/,"b'Severe, persistent cough for ~6 weeks, now hospitalized--and no diagnosis'",,"b'Hello all! I\'m writing this post on behalf of my fianc, who is currently in the hospital due to his severe, persistent cough that he has had for nearly 6 weeks now. Some specs on him; he is 34 (going to be 35), \\~230 pounds, 5\' 11""; not a smoker, pretty active (he used to run anywhere from 3-10 miles a day), doesn\'t have/never had asthma, and is currently employed at a warehouse that packs/ships a variety of things, everything from adhesives to aerosols.\n\nBack in mid-November, my fianc noticed that he had a cough and was feeling a little ""off"". It was a weekend and prior to going in to work on Monday, he called ahead to his supervisor, notifying him that he had a cough; given all the COVID precautions in place, his supervisor suggested that he go to a walk-in clinic to get tested for COVID. So, my fianc did so; he got a COVID test and the result was negative. However, the doctor thought that his cough sounded a bit  more like bronchitis and gave him a course of antibiotics (azithromycin) plus steroids (prednisone). They also took a chest x-ray at the time, but it came back clear (no indication of any infection or fluid in the lungs). After that doctor visit, my fianc completely finished both courses of antibiotics and steroids, felt OK for a few days, but the cough came back.\n\nHis cough was (and had been) non-productive and felt and seemed higher up in his chest. He continued like this for a few days until he went back to the doctor, again; because the antibiotics did not seem to have worked, they figured it was viral and instead prescribed another round of steroids. The cough seemed to get worse and at times, it was slightly productive (he would sometimes cough up yellow or clear or green phlegm, but often nothing at all). He also started to get these severe coughing attacks and would cough so hard that he would gag and sometimes vomit. But, over these last 6 weeks, he\'s never had any other symptoms beyond the coughing; no fever, no stuffy nose, no congestion, nothing. Then, during his second round of steroids, about 3 days in, he had a very bad reaction to the steroids; he went completely pale, felt cool and clammy, could not breathe well, was wheezing, and his arms and legs began to go numb. Our doctor told us to go to the ER immediately and we did. They took his vitals, they took a blood sample, and ran another COVID test; he was completely normal, bloodwork was all normal (no elevated white blood cell count), and negative for his COVID test. They took another chest x-ray but it also came back clear. They checked his breathing (as they had in previous visits) but his lungs sounded completely clear. In time, at the ER, he was able to breathe better and they also administered an anti-anxiety medication which helped. After that, we went back home, but his cough wasn\'t going away, and wasn\'t getting any better.\n\nAfter about another week, we went back to my fianc\'s primary physician, again, and he prescribed, again, a round of azithromycin and prednisone. My fianc finished both courses of those last week, but with no sign of improvement. Over the weekend, too, my fianc had an especially bad fit of coughing and suddenly had a splitting headache; he was coughing so hard and all of sudden, he said that it ""felt like part of his brain exploded."" He developed a really bad migraine and was in the bed for a couple days; since then, he has had headaches on and off (my worry is some kind of a secondary coughing headache). So, we contacted my fianc\'s physician again and he suggested that my fianc get a CT scan and more bloodwork and visit with a pulmonary specialist; we got the CT scan and went to the specialist. The CT scan came back completely clean as well as his bloodwork. Everything was 100% normal, except for my fianc\'s cough. It is persistent and severe; he can hardly speak a full sentence before coughing again and regularly gets bad coughing attacks. At this point, the pulmonologist strongly suggested that my fianc be admitted to the hospital for more testing and intensive treatment in a controlled setting (just in case he had a bad reaction to anything).\n\nNow, we\'re into the second day of my fianc being in the hospital. Day 1, they gave him another course of azithromycin and a steroid (I can\'t recall the name, but it was not prednisone). They did a chest x-ray (came back clear), more bloodwork (came back completely normal), and a COVID test (negative). He did not improve at all in terms of his cough (even with codeine--it seems to have no effect at all on his cough); it\'s a persistent, nagging, kind of hacking cough, that\'s sometimes productive, sometimes not. On Day 1, my fianc also had blood drawn for a pertussis test (I had been wondering if it might be whooping cough and I was relieved that they were finally testing for it). Now, on to Day 2; my fianc is now on a different course of antibiotics and a stronger steroid (I\'m forgetting both names--I\'ll double check). He\'s injected with this steroid once every 8 hours. They also did a respiratory panel today and took a sample/swab similar to the COVID test (i.e., nasopharyngeal swab from way up the nose); those results came back totally clear, no microbes detected (so, our doctor told us that pertussis is not the cause of my fianc\'s coughing--I remain skeptical). And that\'s where we\'re at right now. Still, my fianc isn\'t showing any signs of improvement, even after the new course of antibiotics and steroids today. NOTE: The only time that he DOES NOT cough is when he is sleeping. Once he\'s asleep, out is out like a light and he isn\'t disturbed in his sleep by coughing attacks.\n\nSo, any thoughts or suggestions? I\'m totally at a loss. The only thing I can think of is perhaps some kind of environmental contaminant or exposure to something. My fianc, as I mentioned, does work in a warehouse (although, he\'s been excused from work for the last 6 weeks since he started coughing). Mainly, he packs pallets and moves them around with a forklift. On occasion, he sometimes has to pack pallets with boxes from a hazardous materials room or an aerosols room; but, those materials are always sealed and packed carefully. I just wonder if he was maybe exposed to some kind of an aerosol or some other substance or dust or residue... But, the symptoms don\'t completely line-up. My fianc has severe coughing, and although coughing is a symptom associated with being exposed to some kind of a substance in a workplace, it is typically a part of other symptoms with occupational asthma. My fianc doesn\'t have any asthma symptoms; he can breathe fine, but the coughing can cause him to have trouble breathing when he has a coughing attack. My fianc has two different inhalers that he was prescribed when the coughing started (a typical albuterol inhaler--which doesn\'t help him at all--and a symbicort inhaler--which provides very mild and temporary relief, if any). I was thinking it was pertussis at first; my fianc last had a Tdap shot in 2013 or 2014 (he couldn\'t remember for sure) and although it is relatively recent, that vaccination does lose some potency over time. Although the respiratory panel that my fianc had yesterday came back negative, I wonder what the blood test for pertussis will come back as. Anyway, I have no idea what is going on with my fianc and the doctors seem equally confused and at a loss. Steroids, antibiotics--nothing is having any kind of effect or relief and I\'m getting a little desperate for answers. I appreciate any help! Thank you!'"

Are you in the same boat? Then do it. Of course discuss with your dermatologist first, and look into possible severe side effects that may occur because of genetics (have a family member or maybe more that suffer from chronic migraine or joint pain? Chronic and genetic skin conditions? Its still a drug used to cure or lighten a disease, its not playing around, this is for some a last option, dont let it be your first if you havent tried the simple stuff yet)\n\nBut again, acne is horrible for some, and this post is not meant to deter you, but to give you hope, enlighten and inform you of a way out of what acne is: a skin DISEASE keeping you from enjoying life to the fullest and not worrying about your skin and what others think about it. Dont let your skin hold you down when there is a way out.\n\nThe side effects are nothing compared to the feeling and relief of clear or even just clearer skin. I was lucky not having much acne on my face, but my chest, back, neck and shoulders were covered with cysts, bloody pimples, white and blackheads since forever. It really never bothered me before starting in Denmarks equivalent of high school, with gym classes having to strip naked and take a bath with 50-60 boys at once. I covered my self, or waited to take a bath. I didnt go swimming in the lake at summertime, I didnt take off my hoodie even though it was 100 degrees outside. But now I do, all thanks to these pills. I cant believe how hidden these pills are in Denmark. No ads no recommendations. I had to cry to my mom and in front of my doctor for him to mention them, and Im glad he did. So I spread the word and I think you should too, these pills have saved me from anxiety and probably also from depression. I think its safe to say it saved many people from depression and suicide. \n\nDont worry about the dry skin you will get, dont worry about dry lips, dont worry about feeling extra sore after gym. Youll live, but your acne wont. \n\nI had a purge after roughly one month, and I know see proper clearing after 3 months. I ruined some white t Shirts in the process but I dont care. The only thing I regret is not starting earlier.\n\nI tried a 6 month process with tetracycline, and had to stop after 4 months because of the vomiting, pain, headaches and diarrhea. I tried all the acid based, retinoid based, and nature based creams: all gave me eczema or worse. I tried all the natural scrubs: only sore skin and acne that spread like it was contagious.\n\nI tried dieting, cutting out all the unnecessary fats, sugars and protein. It didnt help. \n\nAcne is a sickness, a disease, a bacterial infection of the dermis. Stop treating it like a phase, like a common simple teenager thing; its not. \n\nDo it. Youll thank yourself, your dermatologist, your skin.\n\nSincerely,\nA teenager finally freee'"

She has had previous allergy evaluation and alpha gal sensitization, however avoidance of mammalia over a year did not resolve symptoms. Previous lab test with differential, tryptase, TSH, C1Q, C4, C1INH total/fur returned normal. In the context of her history of MGUS, angioedema with eosinophilia (Gleich syndrome) is a consideration. Response to steroids suggests histamine-mediated angioedema. Also in differential is Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome given sx of orofacial edema, recurrent peripheral palsy (tongue numbness) \n Provided future lab orders for CBC with differential and C4 to be  drawn during acute attack\n Expand evaluation with testing for bradykinin-angioedema given isolated swelling\n Response to prednisone still leads me to suspect histamine-mediated process most likely. (I responded to high doses of prednisone but it negatively effected me in other ways) \n Discussed that she had only received 4 doses, and we would expect benefit by 3 months, in some instances it may take up 6 months of therapy.

Does anyone have an idea of what this means?""",,"b""I'm a 22 year old female living in Canada. Probably about 5-6 years ago I started having a sort of anxiety. I would get really nervous when nothing was happening and it would feel like butterflies in my stomach. I would have to stop what I was doing for a minute or two and wait for it to pass. It was nothing I couldn't handle and it didn't make a huge impact in my life. I never went to the doctor or talked about it with anyone because it didn't seem like anything. \n\nFast-forward to now. About 2 years ago I started abusing prescription drugs, painkillers. Hydromorph and dilaudid to be exact. I quit about a year ago for a few months but relapsed again. I went to the doctor and am currently tapering and so far I have been successful. I am currently down to 15mg a day and in a couple weeks I will be at 0 and drug free. \n\nSomething weird has been happening to me and I don't know what or why. If I am in a quiet place, my mind starts racing. I don't know what it is exactly that is going through my mind when this is happening. The best way to explain it is to say that while this is happening, I start thinking but I'm thinking about so many things at such a fast pace that I can't actually listen to what it is that I'm thinking about. Its almost like my mind is yelling at me, but so quickly that I don't know what it is yelling about. When this happens, I need to turn on music or start talking out loud.. Anything that will make some noise. Once the music/tv (or whatever it is) is on, my mind goes back to normal. I would say that its like hearing voices, but like I said, I can't make out what the voices are saying (or if it's even my own voice in my head). \n\nI don't know if any of this makes sense, and I apologize if my grammar sucks.

I'm otherwise a healthy 30 y/o male. I do not smoke, do not take drugs and currently don't drink as my stomach can no longer tolerate it. \n\nSymptoms:\n-Chronic nausea, some days worse than others. Stomach just feels very unsettled at times.\n\n-Frequent upward pressure sensation like a burp with no relief\n\n-Occasional vomiting ~once per month\n\n-Stomach feels unsettled, almost as if it's pumping and twitching at times\n\n-Occasional pain in epigastric region\n\n-Weight loss of 30 lbs due to weak appetite from nausea; I've never been overweight \n\nI've taken countless tests without a clear explanation for the nausea. \n\n-Celiac disease - Diagnosed in July 2022; follow up endoscopy in late March shows almost fully healed villi due to GF diet adherence \n\n-Norovirus was detected January 2023, but no longer in my system around February 2023 \n\n-SIBO - Excess methane, remediated in February with antibiotics \n\n-Some excess bile seen in second endoscopy, but GI is certain that some bile alone doesn't explain the duration and severity of my symptoms. \n\nAt this point, it seems none of the above explain the nausea as Celiac is in full remission. \n\nIn addition to two endoscopies:\n\n-CT scan of abdomen and head\n\n-SIBO breath test\n\n-Ultrasound of upper abdomen\n\n-Emptying study \n\n-Countless blood tests and stool tests \n\nMedications tried:\n-Famitodine up to 100mg\n\n-Hyoscyamine \n\n-Onadesterone \n\n-Donnatal\n\n-Reglan\n\n-Every OTC nausea med you can think of, like emetrol, FD gard, pepto bismol, etc.\n\n-Currently 30mg Amitriptyline \n\nI've been on amitriptyline since January, and my GI will likely keep trying up to at least 50mg, but it's not much help so far. \n\nConditions ruled out:\n\n-Celiac (healed)\n\n-Cancers of any kind\n\n-Abdominal migrane\n\n-Addisons disease\n\n-Chrons, UC or other IBD\n\n-Anxiety\n\n-POTS\n\n-Gastroparesis\n\n-Gall bladder (no pain on right side, greasy foods are not a trigger)\n\n-Parasites/other infections/h pylori \n\n-Nutritional deficiencies \n\n-Pancreatic insufficiency\n\n-Food allergy\n\n-Gastritis\n\n-I could go on, but you get the point, it's nothing obvious. \n\nIn addition to a GF diet, I've tried a low FODMAP diet and gastritis friendly diet, and all sorts of supplement regimens. \n\nA concrete diagnosis to explain the duration and severity of symptoms seems elusive at this point. At first I thought it might just be some anxiety, then Celiac Disease, then gastritis, and was relieved to think I had the answer each time.\n\nThe second GI I've seen is world-renound and brilliant, but he's stumped by this just like every other doctor has been. I'm not sure what to do if I'm still sick 6 months or more from now."""

Just a entry from my diary and I hope you find it a little bit informative.',,"b'Good day everybody . Like the title says this is  just an overview from my Diary for any person who would find it maybe informative or helpful .  Just a disclaimer , I am not a Doctor and all medical diagnosis should be done by a medical professional.  Anyhow with that out of the way here is my experience with the above mentioned drugs after my second week of using my prescribed medicine.\n\n Biggest change, the ""super focus "" has subsided now .  I think my body is getting used to the feeling or the drugs . I knew this was going to happen so I was prepared for it so now I think this will be my baseline. Maybe it will go down a little more but we will see.\n\nI feel like what a normal person would feel like on a normal day or a close proximation to it . I don\'t know the feeling so this is the only way I can describe it.  I thought for a second that perhaps it could make me a bit more clever but I always knew it would not but we cant help but to hope . I will say this though , It may not make you clever but it gives you the ability to become clever or rather more knowledgeable in my case ( the ability to learn things).  One of my biggest issues have always been that I could not concentrate for a long periods , lets say 10 minutes at a time . this is not very conducive for studying and in the age that we live in now you kind of have to have some degree or degrees and if you not able to study then I have some bad news for you .  Not saying that the only way to success is with a degree but if you are planning on working for a company you have to.\n\nSo that is just the concentration part but what I gained was worth so much more that just being able to study and concentrate . This has opened up other avenues . the ability to listen to people for the first time and  I don\'t feel handicapped . My future now truly lies in my hands  .  The drug does not make you magically want to study but it gives me the opportunity to do so   . At least  if I screw up my life then that is on me.\n\nThis drug is not a wonder cure , silver bullet or whatever you want to call it but it affords you the opportunity to have a chance at life and that is all I can ask for.\n\nThank you all for reading this long ass post . I know you guys and gals are dealing with a lot of things and your time is precious so I do appreciate it .   I hope that this was at least a little bit informative . \n\nStay strong my fellow humans , The struggle is real but we need to try and give it our best effort so that we can at  least say that we tried our best and that is good enough '"

Told my headache specialist/neurologist about it on Thursday and she prescribed me a steroid dose pack. There is no change yet, my migraine is still at a 8 on the pain scale and now experiencing vision issues, like blurriness. I also don't have any appetite. I did vomit twice yesterday but that's another chronic issue. The migraine I know the ER can help me with by giving me the migraine cocktail. My doctor suggested I go if I feel I can't handle my migraine. But I have something else going on that is actually worse then the migraine.\n\nI feel like I'm burning up, like I have a fever but don't. I been having a problem wearing my mask because of this. It's like I'm being burned from the inside out. It's currently the worst on my face/head and my arms. It's very painful. When I was first experiencing this pain back in 2021 I did go to the ER but the doctor said they couldn't really do anything for it and gave a vitamin infusion. It did not work and was sent home anyways. I wasn't diagnosed with POTS yet or had 3 neurologist following my complex case, I don't know if that makes any difference though. I'm also experiencing more visible symptoms along with the burning, like being clammy, and wincing from pain but Im still not showing my pain like I should for some reason. Which does cause problems with others believing I'm actually at the pain level I say.\n\nI don't really want to go to the ER for many reasons. One being I just don't want to sit there in pain to be told they can't do anything when I could be home in pain... or just be told to see my neurologist which is absolutely impossible because he's booked. I feel so sick though and my pain is at a 9, barely able to do anything. I don't know what to do in this painful situation or figure out if anyone could actually help me.\n\nHere's some more info about me:\n\n24/F, white, 155lbs, 5'6.

Public health system. \n\nIdk what to do anymore. 10 years of misdiagnosis, I only seek help when severely depressed. Then SSRIs on. I get diagnosed. It is bad. I cut them off since I\'m manic. I ask for another screening. They refuse.\n\nCurrent psychiatrist is just approving her mentor report of 4 years ago right now. First meeting with her, she said so. She writes me as not suicidal while I am. She\'s contacting the victim center psychologist I got. I\'ve been raped and abused for 2 years. She doesn\'t believe it. She doesn\'t believe I got ADHD, an eating disorder for 18 years, GERD, mood disorder or whatever.\n\nShe says I\'m resistant to treatment. She\'s gonna make me go through the same treatment I failed for 2 years. She will cut me off my Vyvanse and Dexillant - it\'s all in my head according to her notes.\n\nI struggle with the thought of killing myself since I got my cats. I\'m not suicidal, right.\n\nI talk too fast, too much, say too many words. I\'m super cooperative. She said at first meeting of 1/3 I\'m aggressive since I said there were errors in my patient file --- too many life stories version. I tried to tell her SSRIs made me go manic, it did recently. She brush it off.\n\nI gave her 10 sheets of my writings for this year for helping her to get my mind. She didn\'t fetch the papers. She assumed it wasn\'t important. When I talked, I\'m all over the place. She gets impatient. She wants me to get to the point. I can\'t explain properly if I don\'t say why y and z led me to x.\n\nI tried to make the misdiagnosis of cluster B go away. It didn\'t work.\n\nHer secretary was meant to send me a sick leave paper. She sent me the psychiatric notes. I saw everything. I was in shock for some hours. She confirmed everything in those, but went from some traits of personality disorder to severe traits of cluster B. I sent an email to secretary to ask her to check back if it was the right document. Psychiatrist called me and she was panicking hard. She asked me what I thought of it. I tried to answer, she told me not to, and to note whatever I thought of it, but I wasn\'t meant to see it, nor my employer.\n\nI have a court case going against a guy for raping me twice --- but abusing me for 2 years. I felt guilty it was my fault. He always said I was the sociopath and he was the nice guy. I kinda got empowered by social workers after the second rape where he anally raped me during my sleep. Now, I feel powerless.\n\nI think everything is my fault if I\'m cluster B. SSRIs makes me go manic, atypical anti-psychotics make go on spending sprees. Vyvanse gave me a second life, but she\'s gonna remove it according to her notes because, hey, no ADHD, just severe personality disorder.\n\nI\'m struggling about what to do next. I wanna ask for specific meds I\'ve been asking ever since April (Lamictal). Psychiatrist said I don\'t need any, since it\'s who I am.\n\nI tried to go many years without meds. I got months where I\'m fine, others where I can\'t get up from my bed, others where I\'m on top of the world. She doesn\'t hear me.\n\nI don\'t know what to do anymore. I fought for so many years. Every word I say is digging my own grave.\n\nI wanna really know what to do. I\'m tempted to not say a word. Just write. Give them the papers. They always say I\'m confusing, all over the place, difficult to follow. But, hey, no ADHD.\n\nBut honestly, some friends who don\'t know me tell me I should try back their treatment (that I failed). Friends who know me don\'t know what to say. I\'m hiding it from my family.\n\nI\'m hopeless to be honest.\n\nI thought this was my last chance. So many psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, social workers, doctors.I realize now its a loop I\'m stuck in.\n\nShould I stop talking and be silent? Go back to work and act like everything is fine? Kill myself when it\'s too much? I can\'t get any help. They think I\'m manipulating them. If I ever mention ""suicide"", it\'s a black label on my file. Idk how to get help if I can\'t be honest or can\'t question the system.\n\nHow should I react? Whst should I do next? I got a last psych evaluation with that psychiatrist, I\'m tempted to refuse. I see my doctor next week, I want lamictal but she won\'t prescribe it it seems. SSRI and snris and atypical psychotic have been tried. I\'m on a black list of benzies. I\'m scared ill have to get speed to deal with my adhd if they remove it. Lol what a shit hole....\n\nThe more I fight, the more I wanna give up. It\'s nonsense. It\'s never gonna end it seems. I can\'t fight it anymore. I am tired.'"

NSAID eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/ffnb7b/well_i_was_optimistic_about_this/,"b'Well, I WAS optimistic about this.'",,"b'Hello. I am not excited that any of us are on this subreddit, but at least we have each other?\n\nI\'m a 26 year old female, somewhat active and not overweight. In October 2019, I ran a 5K that involved obstacles. I felt great during it and had a lot of fun. I can\'t pinpoint exactly when my injury happened, but I have to assume that it happened during one of the 6 ft wall jumps. I woke up the next day feeling slightly tender in my hamstring area on the right side. I assumed that this was what it felt like to pull a hamstring and I decided to just give it a rest and let it heal on its own. \n\nI stopped running for about 2 weeks and then started up again. I was feeling very sore in the hamstring area but didn\'t really think anything of it. Then it started to get worse. I distinctly remember standing up out of my car and I felt a shooting pain that brought tears to my eyes. It never really got better from there. Around the first of the year, I scheduled an appointment with an orthopedic doctor that my friend had recommended to me. I was still thinking at the time that the problem was with my hamstring. I had no clue that it was related to my back. He manipulated my leg moved me around, and almost instantaneously said, ""this has nothing to do with your hamstring - this is related to your L5S1."" He said that because I am young he recommended that I go through physical therapy and stretches and then follow up with him in about a month.\n\nI got about two weeks into physical therapy, and was feeling pretty good. I was still hurting when I stood up and when I stretched, but the shooting pains were a lot less painful. Then, I had an appointment one day that involved a resistance band, and my pain got five times worse. All of a sudden, instead of just having hamstring pain when I stretched or stood up, I had pain that radiated from my hip down to my foot 24/7. I kept doing physical therapy thinking it was part of it. Sometimes my foot is tingly and I lose toe sensation. Immediately upon my follow up appointment a month later, my doctor ordered an MRI.\n\nThe MRI showed not only a herniation with impingement at L5S1, but also a herniation at L4. While I was disappointed to learn that it was a little bit more serious than I had originally thought, it was good to finally have a diagnostic answer.\n\nWe have stopped the physical therapy for now, but I am in so much pain and it only gets worse by the day. I can\'t do any of the Stuart McGill big 3 exercises because it hurts too much. The doctor prescribed me 1,200 mg per day of Gabapentin, but I can never get past 600 per day (Even if I take most of it for bed) without being utterly useless at work. I basically feel like I am drunk even on the lower doses. \n\nWith the opinion of a second spine specialist at the same clinic, they recommended that I get an epidural steroid injection. I received my steroid injection on Wednesday March 4th, but so far the pain has only increased, and it has been 5 days since the injection. I have gotten no relief from the first injection. The clinic where I received my injection said that I may need to come back for a second injection, but part of me does not want to even waste my time if that won\'t work either. I am desperate because I am half hopeful that the steroid injections will work, but I am half pessimistic that they will not do anything like the first shot. The spine specialist told me that if these injections are not working for me, my follow-up on March 20th may involve a sit-down conversation with a surgeon. I wanted to be one of those people in this sub who healed simply from stretching, but I can\'t even do that. I am so frustrated and I just want my life back.\n\nI can\'t drive without intense pain, I can\'t sleep well at all no matter how many positions or pillows I try, I can\'t sit through work or get anything done, I can\'t do household chores either. Even trying to take NSAIDS or acetomenophen (or both) with or without the Gabapentin has not worked.\n\nSometimes I scroll through this sub and see people who have had this pain for years and have not gotten an MRI yet or people who manage to get past the pain using the Stuart McGill methods. And I have no idea whether or not I am being overly dramatic thinking that surgery may be the only choice I have left 5 months post injury. I have stopped bothering to talk to Friends my age about this issue because they all start spouting out random things about yoga as if I can even slightly bend my knee without pain.'"

For about two months I was like this.\n\n\\-Fall 2019, have MRI and told I have osteoarthritis- mostly on left side, and that I can only do over the counter pain management and/or expensive experimental surgery. I was no longer in pain and couldn\'t afford the surgery so did over the counter pain management when needed.\n\n\\-A few weeks ago I was suddenly hit with a ton of jaw pain and could only open my mouth about 1cm\n\n\\-Went back to Oral Surgeon\'s office, but it\'s a new doctor who won\'t help with the pain and tells me I have to wait 5 weeks to see if someone at the office can make me a mouth guard. Botox and arthrocenteis are offered as treatments and eventual joint replacement discussed. X-ray shows mild worsening of osteoarthritis.\n\n\\-Pain gets worse, oral surgeon says we can do arthrocentesis sooner rather than later but I am reluctant for obvious reasons. \n\n\\-I speak virtually do my GP who prescribes Meloxicam. I become very tired and the pain is worse and spreads throughout my body (jaw and ear pain were typical, and now there was headache pain, neck and shoulder pain, left arm , left leg spontaneously would start to feel warm,. \n\n\\-I stop taking it after a few days and I feel better but the new pains such as the arm and leg (but I haven\'t felt it in 24 hours at this moment) don\'t go away. I see GP in person who takes blood (I will link results) and prescribed the naproxen and muscle relaxer.\n\n\\-Today I have left arm pain around wrist and had shooting pain from my left breast. Jaw of course still feels bad.\n\nAlso: I have lost about 15 pounds in a couple of weeks from inability to eat anything I have to bite into. Which has lead to fatigue and dizziness if I am not on top of it.\n\nAlso- the blood test results have some flags, but she historically has never taken anything seriously if it was just out of range and I know there are other ranges out there that may say that I am fine. She also hasn\'t looked at them yet. However, its the weekend and it\'s making me anxious. So if anyone has any suggestions, can tell me if maybe the medicines are causing extra pain (I know the spironolactone has interactions) or if the osteoarthritis can really cause my whole body to turn on itself, that would be great.

Asthma (inactive) and seasonal allergies, bipolar II, anxiety, borderline personality disorder (I suspect the last may be misdiagnosed autism and am awaiting assessment). Frequent joint and neck/back pain for which I havent sought diagnosis. Currently taking 150mg Effexor XR, 50mg Lamictal, 1.5mg Klonopin, 500mg Metformin (not for diabetes), 145mcg Linzess, 900mg Neurontin (for the issue described below), 5mg Flexeril (PRN), and 100mg Celebrex (PRN).\n\nI have had a brain, face, and neck MRI come back clean, and the ENT noticed no symptoms of palsy. I am waiting to see a neurologist.\n\nSummary: I tweezed something from my hard palate, layers of multiple rugae peeled off, now have sense of laxity to left mouth and cheek and pulling/tension in the face.\n\nIts difficult to find a common thread in these symptoms, but timing of onset suggests theyre all somehow related to the original injury to the palate. Because of the areas involved, Im not sure what kind of doctor to see, and worry any specialist will disregard my concerns about the other areas affected.\n\n2017: Sharp protrusion on palate kept irritating my tongue, so I (stupidly) tweezed it. Mild bleeding and moderate pain. Shortly after (potentially unrelated), detected tissue poking out by the gumline near maxillary left premolars. Used my tongue to pull what felt like a wide, flat ribbon of tissue that felt connected to other thinner, more rigid pieces of tissue that snapped lightly as they were pulled.\n\nLate 2022: Tissue felt like it unwound over incisive canal, flattening cushy papilla. Most anterior rugae on left (prob what I tweezed) unraveled/peeled, followed by right. Picked layers off rugae at center of palate. Began experiencing episodes of dystonia in neck/shoulders, feeling of twisting in throat, trouble swallowing, indigestion, tingling in limbs, creaking neck, and traveling nerve sensations over head and face. The tissue on my palate would shift on its own at the same time. It sometimes felt like there was tissue pulling under my skin, both in the left side of the face and upward in my left nostril. I experienced heavy pressure at the right sternocleidomastoid and suprasternal notch, after which I noticed a vertical neck band. My face often felt internally twisted afterward, with my smile pulled in awkward directions (e.g. upward on one side and down on the other).\n\nI also experienced a heavy feeling to lower left face and left side of mouth, pain in the cuspids, coldness around the front six maxillary teeth, numbness in the lower half of the face and in the nose/to the sides of the nose, increased twitching throughout my face, weakness (to the touch) of left nostril sill, philtral ridge, and Cupids bow, and intermittent asymmetry (skewed right). The remaining attached portions of the rugae would often hurt from the pressure they exerted on one another and the weight of my lip, and have wiry-feeling pieces left holding the remnants in place. For a long time, I had a very sore, pulsing point above my left upper lip.\n\nNow/still: Persistent feeling of weakness to the left corner of my mouth and left upper lip, like it falls too far forward at the top, and often appears slightly lower than my right upper lip. It feels like the upper and lower lips dont meet fully at the left side. My left cheek feels like it tips out/isnt held toward the center of my face. I can move the fat pads in my left cheek into different resting positions relative to the underlying bones just by moving face; doing this too much and letting it settle leaves it feeling twisted internally. Lying on my back, I often get uncomfortable pulling at the sides of my nose. The tension I feel in my facenow all the way up to my eyesremits as I trace lightly with my finger from that point back toward my mouth, where the tissue along my gums and palate loosens. I can feel the tension shift places, traveling noticeably from the left to right side of my face (under chin or over/through nose); it feels like theres actual tissue moving. I feel tissue insert into my left nostril (sometimes makes it hard to breathe) and pull at the columella. Frequent headaches.\n\nOther notes: Twisting my finger in my left ear and nostril loosens or pulls the tissue in my mouth. When my left ear was especially tight, I experienced the sensation of something pulling from the back of my ear over the front; I could pause it with my finger. Experienced similar feeling off left nostril. Dragging finger down around left corner of smile turns left side into grimace. My left jaw has always clicked/been flexible, but never before caused problems.\n\nAny ideas are much appreciated. I am especially worried because the location on the palate and of the pulsing above my lip align with the nasalis and incisivus labii superioris. No one will touch my palate because the issue isnt visible, and is too fine to image via radiograph.\n\nPhotos in comment (under AutoMod).'"

I hate having to cry before I go into work and then walking in like nothing happened.  \nIm losing all of my motivation and sometimes I feel so disconnected from everything that I CANT cry, no matter how much I feel that swelling feeling in my chest/throat.  \nand Ive come close to ending my life before. It wouldve actually happened once if there werent police at the bridge I drove to that night. I dream and fantasize and plan it very often, but thats the only time Ive ever truly nearly done it. I used to take acetaminophen, but BARELY enough over the allowed dosages just to see if anything would happen. It was stupid, I know, couldve fucked up my organs. All I ever got was mild pain. I was hoping it would be enough for something to happen without committing to ending it completely so somebody would get the hint that I need help. \n\nOther than that one isolated incident though, I dont know if I actually would ever be able to go through with killing myself, I feel too cowardly. Although sometimes I really do scare myself.  \nChecking myself into a mental hospital does seem dramatic but I feel as if I WANT to do something dramatic because Ive been crying out to my parents for help since I was a teen and nobody will listen. The one time I asked for help because I had relapsed (cutting), my dad straight up told me that therapy is a waste of time and money and that Im just looking for attention. I feel like nobody cares and I feel so awful only being able to Vent to my friends because none of them feel bad to the extent that I do; and I feel like telling them my problems is selfish and puts a lot of stress on their backs. \n\nBut I dont know if the way I feel is serious enough for a solution like checking myself into a hospital. Plus there would be embarrassing consequences - having to call out of work and tell them where I went. My coworkers would find out, I like them a lot and dont want them to think any less of me. My friends might judge me too. My family would make fun of me and walk on eggshells around me. The people I know who have been checked in told me it was a miserable experience. \n\nI dont know how to start therapy on my own though; Im under my parents health insurance so I would have to go to my familys primary doctor to start and my dad would find out and be disappointed in me.

NSAID problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/3dizuh/my_dentist_told_me_im_clenching_my_jaw_heres_what/,"b""My dentist told me I'm clenching my jaw. Here's what we did next.""",,"b'I was going to call this post ""Fun With Bruxism"", but that didn\'t seem like a very descriptive subject line.\n\n**tl;dr** - bruxism (jaw clenching) is a possible side effect of stimulants. It can show up as a head and neck/shoulder pain, and you might not have any pain in your jaw or even notice that youre clenching your teeth (at least at first.) If youre having headaches and neck pain a lot, talk to your dentist and to the doctor who  prescribes your ADHD meds about the possibility that you\'re clenching your jaw. If you\'re having persistent pain in your jaw, **get yourself to a dentist ASAP**. This symptom has a lot of possible causes, and none of them are things you want to mess around with. \n\nLast week I started having some pretty bad pain in my jaw near my back teeth. My first assumption was that my wisdom teeth were coming in, so I went in to see my dentist. He poked around in my mouth, moved my jaw in different ways and noticed it was making a slight clicking noise, and said that its probably bruxism. He gave me a list of instructions for how to treat it on my own, and told me to call him in two weeks and let him know how it went.\n\nThe thing I want to emphasize is that up until this happened, I wasnt aware that I was clenching my jaw at all. I tend to get headaches in the afternoon, and before now I just assumed that it was my medication wearing off, but right around the time my jaw started hurting they got a lot worse (to the point that Aleve + Tylenol barely took the edge off) and starting showing up around the clock. It turns out that [tension in your jaw can cause headaches](http://www.migrainetrust.org/factsheet-jaw-tension-in-migraine-and-headaches-10889), as well as pain in your neck and shoulders (two other things Ive had problems with, and which Id previously attributed to working at a computer all day.)\n\nBelow are the home treatment suggestions my dentist gave me to follow for the next two weeks. Most of them are pretty non-invasive and safe, but if you have *any* questions about anything, ask your dentist and/or your doctor.\n\n1. **Keep your teeth apart.** If your teeth arent touching then they cant clench. This is simple but not easy - Id gotten used to holding my teeth together by default, and forcing my muscles to do something they werent used to was pretty painful (but the next two steps helped with this). If you have any questions about proper jaw posture, ask your dentist.\n2. **Use warm wet compresses on your jaw.** A paper towel run under a warm faucet is just fine.My dentist recommended doing this for about five minutes as often as possible, up to once an hour during the day if need be. Ive been doing it every couple of hours during work breaks.\n3. **Take over-the-counter anti-inflammatory meds.** Specifically, Im supposed to take them consistently (so that its always in my system) for at least two weeks, even if my jaw isnt hurting. This is something you definitely should **discuss with your doctor before you try it**, because using NSAIDs on the regular carries its own risks.\n4. **Dont open your mouth any wider than your thumb**. The way my dentist explained it, opening your mouth wide causes your jaw muscles to tense, and were trying to keep them from doing that as much as possible for a while. This may not be necessary or helpful for everyone  - ask your dentist.\n5. **Eat soft-ish food in bite-sized pieces.** Related to the above, my food has to be smaller that my thumb. Im also supposed to avoid biting down and tearing food with my teeth as much as possible. This means no crusty bread or raw veggies, no chewing gum, no tough meats/meat-like things (which I mention because Im a vegetarian), and I have to be the snooty asshole who eats his pizza with a knife and fork for a while. Its annoying, but its all to give my jaw muscles a break. As with step #4, this might be overkill for some people. **Ask your dentist**.\n6. **Sleep on your back if you can.** Other positions can force your teeth together, which is exactly what we dont want. This was definitely the worst one for me, but it also seemed to help a lot. I managed to get through all of last night without flipping over. Even though it was really uncomfortable and Im pretty sure I got less actual sleep than when Im on my side, I *still* felt a lot better and more rested than I normally do. If youve got issues with sleep apnea or something else that makes it difficult to sleep on your back, **talk to your doctor**.\n\nI cannot overemphasize that you should **talk to your doctor and/or dentist** if you think youre having this problem. Im only describing my own case and whats worked for me. So far Im seeing some pretty solid improvement with the above measures, but you may not need to do everything Im doing, or you may need to do other things like adjust your medication or wear a night guard. I cant answer questions about what degree and type of treatment will be necessary or helpful for you. '"

It is harder than the surrounding skin, but like you might expect a firm pimple to be, and again, it does have a white head on it.\n\nOther facts to note about me:\n\n1. I take a large number of medications for hypertension (bisoprolol, amlodipine, clonidine), Crohn's (prednisone for six months, just started back on Stelara two weeks ago, kratom for pain relief), and generalized anxiety / insomnia (alprazolam, Ambien, melatonin, diphenhydramine). Low B12 / D that is now being treated by my gastroenterologist with injections and supplements.\n2. I do drink (approximately four to six beers in the evening every day).\n3. I have had kidney issues in the past, and have some mild fatty liver, probably from ricocheting back and forth in weight due to Crohn's.\n\nI don't think there were any medication changes around the time I first noticed this.\n\nAs mentioned, it's been about 10 weeks or so since I first noticed this. I tend to have bad skin in general with a tendency to get cystic acne and abscesses, so at first I didn't think much of it, but it is definitely not like any cystic acne or abscess (both of which I have had recently, i.e. in the last four weeks - the abscess resolved on its own and was nowhere near the site of this rash).\n\nNo pain or itching (well, mild pain when I push on the bump), which is another reason why I don't think about it much. No fever. COVID ruled out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCould it be a parasite such as a botfly or something?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ikweb20ndrw81.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6ccc2d132cadef18e0c572a6f22602460a11ef05"""
acetaminophen problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/11k1hrq/diclofenacmedication_questions_and_advice_request/,b'Diclofenac/Medication Questions and Advice Request',,"b""Hi everyone.  I started having sciatica and joint problems in my right side beginning at the end of January. For the first 2-3 weeks I could barely walk (a 2 minute walk to the kitchen turned into 30min+!) but now it's at a tolerable point where I can walk short distances with a cane and do minor physical activities. I'm not sure what caused this. It feels like a mix of stabbing nerve pain, inflammation and aching in my joint. I's not related to my spine (had negative spinal Xrays in January before this) and I'm currently waiting for results on a hip Xray I took last week. I am also scheduled to start physical therapy in the next week. If that doesn't help my doctor is looking towards an MRI. (6 weeks of PT is for the insurance hoops for an MRI.)\n\nI was taking a lot of Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen every day for the first few weeks for the pain. Acetaminophen for the general pain and Ibuprofen for the pain and inflammation I could feel pulsing and stabbing in my side. I ended up developing Edema in my feet, ankles and lower calves from taking too much Ibuprofen (didn't know it could do that to you!) so I stopped the Ibuprofen. After the edema cleared up my doctor put me on Diclofenac DR (75mg x2/day) to help with the pain and inflammation I am getting/feeling around the joint in my right hip/leg. \n\n***My questions are if this is a pretty standard dose of Diclofenac or if this goes any higher, and if this is a medication that can be taken long term as a means of treatment? I was also wanting to see if there were any other recommendations for medications that would help (I'm already on an opioid medication so I'm not asking for opioid-related controlled substances!).*** I know Diclofenac is generally a strong NSAID and I've been told not to take any others (not really trusting Ibuprofen anymore, honestly. lol!).\n\nI'm only on Diclofenac for a few more days as it's temporary until I see my primary doctor on the 15th and would like to have an idea of the plan ahead and discuss this with her. I definitely think it helps, along with the other medication I'm taking (I can tell a difference with and without for comparison), but of course I'm trying to be optimistic and open as I've never experienced anything like this in my life. \n\nAnyway, sorry for somewhat ranting and giving too much extra details and whatnot lol.   \nThank you to anyone who reads and answers and good health to you all!

Had clear skin for approx 2 years before starting effexor. Began getting blemishes when i first went on the drug but did not even suspect it was the cause as there were a lot of factors at play around that time. As I went up a couple of doses over time, I slowly realised that the increase in acne that followed each time had to have been related to the drug. I decided to begin to taper down to the lowest dosage over a couple of weeks to test my theory, and the results were abundantly clear. I realise there is not a lot of data connecting effexor and acne (hence why I didnt suspect it was the cause), which is why I decided to post this in case some one else may be having a similar experience. Naturally, your mental health would probably be more important to you than having clear skin (Although if you are like me the two things are correlated), and not everyone is going to have the same side effects from a drug (as I said, the aggregate data from people taking this drug has not identified that breakouts are a common side effect), so this anecdote may be immaterial to you. All the same, I felt obliged to post this as I was so surprised and frankly really frustrated.\n\nTLDR effexor caused me to have terrible acne'"

Feel free to skip over my rant and just jump to the end to offer advice. \n\nSo my common law husband has found out he's got cancer on his nose and needs surgery to remove it and do cosmetic repairs afterwards The surgery is in another province (we're in Canada) as it would take too long to see a surgeon here.  It's scheduled for April 10th.  It is an 7-8 hour drive if the weather is good. It is steep mountain passes and winding canyon road for about 2  hours of it so it could be longer if snowy. And I'll be doing the driving on my own for the return trip.  There's also a chance we'd have to go again a few weeks later to do follow up.  \n\nI'm struggling with sitting as it is, and lately walking has also become a problem.  \n\nBegin rant: Relationship wise we're also struggling (have been for a long time but hes probably unaware), because I've always been the bottom of his priority list behind his job and his grown-ass daughter. I know it's my fault for not sticking up for myself (the rest of my family has also taken advantage of me so he's not unique). \n\nFor context (feel free to skip this part):  When I was first hurt he left me at the hospital and wouldn't come back for me, I had to wake up my son who'd just come off a graveyard shift and lives a half hour away to come get me, because husband was too busy with work. Yet just a few months prior he had a gallbladder surgery and I left work to take him and stayed til they wheeled him in, and made sure I was back before they brought him back.  And early in our relationship I had to have surgery to get my tubes tied because I couldnt take birth control anymore, it was giving me severe migraines and my doc was afraid I'd  have a stroke. He refused to have a much easier vasectomy.  He also didnt want my kids calling him dad. And he's not been terribly supportive in helping me around the house either since ive been hurt (not even while he was laid off for the winter) I continued to shovel snow, sand the driveway, carry in wood for heat, clean the house, etc. So yeah, I'm not that important,  but when the tables are turned I'm always there for him, and I will be this time too. I do love him still regardless.  \n\nThere is another option.  An airport an hour away. The flight is only 45 minutes to the town we need to get to.  But he doesn't want to fly because his face will be all bandaged up.  I can truly understand this and sympathize with him, but if he were in pain I would be willing to fly for him even if I felt uncomfortable and self conscious. Heck, I'm sure he'd get all kinds of sympathy from the flight crew.  I just know if the tables were turned he would not drive me.  Hell, he probably wouldn't even go with me because it would mean missing work.\n\nSo all my emotional bagage and feeling sorry for myself aside, can anyone give me some advice on how to endure the drive? I can take pain meds for the drive there (I have opioids) as he'll be helping with the driving, but on the way back I can't take anything, and he's not going to want to stop anywhere public either.  I plan on taking some ice packs, some hot patches and some pain meds for when I'm not driving.  Tylenol and NSAIDs do nothing for me. I've tried half a dozen different useless cushions. What else can I do to make this less painful, or are there any pain meds that won't make me drowsy or high?  I am really hoping it won't be as bad as I think but I want to prepare for the worst."""

Now I have some degenerative changes due to aging and what I believe is an injury due to weight lifting, which is spondylolisthesis of L4 slipping over L5.  \n\nAbout six months ago I started to experience a lot of pain while sitting up in bed.  That evolved into sciatica radiating down into both legs and I eventually went to the doctor for that.  She put me on a burst of prednisone, which was very effective, but when I was done with that the pain gradually returned.  Now it's changed and it's mostly right side.  \n\nHere is my problem.  I'm a musician and, though I'm retired from my day job, I have an active life with shows and rehearsals.  I have a show scheduled for this coming Saturday and have three rehearsals this week.  \n\nMy problem is that my sciatica comes back without warning and basically cripples me.  Yesterday I could not walk unless I was bent almost fully over and I could not bear any weight on my right leg at all.  It was so bad I ordered a pair of crutches so that I could get around without using that leg at all.  \n\nI had a rehearsal last night, and I have prednisone leftover here so I took that in 10mg increments until I hit a point of relief just so I could get through my obligations (40mg was the magic).  I know that I can't use prednisone every day but it is the only thing I've done so far that gets me functional.  I do have several different kinds of braces that I wear depending on where the pain seems to be radiating from but they don't always help. \n\nI texted my doctor yesterday; it's very hard to get an appointment with her, but she sent me to a nurse for two injections today; Toradol and decadron.  From what I gather, one is an NSAID and one is a steroid.  \n\nIn the meantime I've also been doing stretching and physical therapy, and I'm on 15 mg of meloxicam daily and also nortryptyline.  I don't think any of that is helping much.  \n\nI have an appointment with my doctor on Feb 2, not sure what I should be looking for in terms of next steps. This thing is utterly crippling when it comes on and I am not sure what I can do on my own to alleviate this.  I have thought about contacting a different doctor through telehealth to see about getting emergency prescriptions so that I have prednisone around for burst use when I just need to be functional over the short-term, like when I have a show.  I know the dangers; my career was in public health and I understand what it does to my immune system and my adrenal glands and not to use it daily.  But so far it's the only thing that's given me my life back long enough to get something done.  \n\nI guess I'm looking for any additional thoughts.  I'm so new to this.  I had no idea this could be so crippling and I feel so bad for everyone here who goes through it.  My heart goes out to you.  Thanks in advance for any help or thoughts you can offer."""

One example is a patient with bipolar disorder who has been treated with clonazepam 1mg QID and nothing else. Geriatric patients on tenazepam for sleep, and several patients on benzodiazepines for sleep/anxiety AND opiates for chronic pain (without snri, tca or gabapentinoid). \n\nThese are not situations I am comfortable with really but Im stuck on this contract to stay in the USA with my family.

I was polite but extremely impulsive (moreso than other kids my age) and used to lose things and forget to turn off the tap/TV which would get me beaten by my father. I didn't seem to learn a lesson. I also had an extraordinarily good memory (not me saying this but others) which I still have to this day.  \n\n\nI was never able to make friends as I'd weird/annoy people. I experienced severe depression and thoughts of suicide back in 2011. In late-2012, something happened which changed my life completely. I experienced euphoria like never before. I took ecstasy and cocaine two years ago and was stunned by how I could have felt exactly like that as a kid without taking any substances. I had so much motivation to do anything. For the entirety of 2013, I genuinely believed that my life would be happy and trouble free. I did well in school but eventually became to euphoric that I forgot to study. I also attempted to castrate myself after listening to Sting's - If I Ever Lose My Faith In You. One thing that a lot of people mentioned (and still do today) is that I had a creepy grin on my face. A guy in my class in school actually thought I was high all the time because he said I had a constant grin.  \n\n\nThe next year, the depression returned only this time, it lasted for the whole year. It was really horrible and one night in November, I felt horrible. The next week my mother and I got into an argument and I assaulted her physically. Something I have never done and which shocked both of us.  \n\n\nI continued going to school but eventually I started making homicidal/suicidal comments which disturbed students and they told the principal in 2015. My principal contacted social service who contacted my parents and said that they'd have to bring me to a GP. My GP organised an appointment with CAMHS and I saw a psychiatrist the next month. I was prescribed the antipsychotic Abilify and Prozac and though it got rid of my homicidal thoughts, I felt suicidal again as well as extremely tired. I stopped attending school physically and was homeschooled.  \n\n\nAfter failing school and having a bad experience with the psychiatric system I decided to start self-medicating. That's around the first time I discovered sites like erowid, bluelight, drugs-forum and Reddit's /r/drugs. My GP also gave me a large supply of benzodiazepines and that started my addiction. I soon started taking benzos, OTC opioids (codeine), nicotine, and alcohol. When I went to America, I tried my aunt's hydrocodone pills and loved them even more.  \n\n\nI came back to Europe and started forging scripts until I got caught and cautioned.  \n\n\nToday I'm drug-free (sort of) but still have difficulty making friends and I'm constantly called annoying, weird, and immature (my parents think me wanting to castrate myself is immaturity and I'm not sure about that). On the plus side, the same people who put me down also say I'm really smart but I'm not sure about that especially as I'm 23 and only entering college while others my age are out in the world working and living independently.  \n\n\nMy GP said he thinks I might have ADHD or Aspergers. He said that if it was the former, prescribing Ritalin, Adderall, or Vyanase would help my symptoms.  \n\n\nHe believes that I may have been mistakenly diagnosed with Aspergers due to the difficulty making friends which is common in ADHD. The one difference though is that I have no problems reading peoples facial expressions and have no problem with eye contact (even maintain it for too long especially when looking at others). The other think that leads him to believe it's ADHD is my constant posting of random topics on the internet (I showed him my Bluelight posting history and Reddit posting history)."""

codeine vomit,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/11w6547/help_multiple_doctors_havent_found_whats_wrong/,"b""Help! Multiple doctors haven't found what's wrong""",,"b'Current Medications: Trazodone 150mg 1x per night, Pregabalin 200mg 2x per day\n\n29F, 5\'7"", 135lbs, white - below is a very detailed overview of my health. I am looking for anybody who can potentially lead me in which direction I should turn to next.\n\nShort Version: I\'ve had the same chronic pain in my left upper abdominal quadrant for 3 years, since March 2020. The pain is primarily located anteriorly just underneath the rib cage in the mid-clavicular line. The pain seems to be gradual throughout the day, with it being pretty severe at night, depending on what I am doing or how I am sitting. The pain will occasionally radiate to the back, up towards the sternum, and down towards the pubis and the groin on the left side. The pain is mostly positional, meaning I can relieve it by standing up, walking around, or lying down because it is most severe when I am sitting, whether that be driving, on the couch, at a table, etc. There is nothing that takes my pain away other than adjusting positions, but mostly laying down. No pain medications relieve my pain. (a detailed list of things I\'ve tried for pain will be at the bottom) I have had multiple imaging studies including a CTA of the abdomen/pelvis that showed possible Nutcracker syndrome with a 17 degree angle between the aorta and SMA with dilation of the left renal vein. I was evaluated by UW Madison for consideration of an autotransplant of my left kidney. However, after I underwent a venogram which showed equal pressures between the renal vein and IVC, Dr. Foley did not want to offer the surgery.  \nI also have had irregular menstrual cycles since I began having periods. Within the last few years, I feel like I almost get the ""period flu"" or have more PMDD symptoms before I\'m about to get it.\n\nLong Version: This all started in March 2020, my office had just moved to working from home with the Coronavirus outbreak. I hadn\'t gotten a desk/office chair for home yet, so I started out by sitting on my couch with my laptop in my lap for a couple of weeks. After about 3 weeks in I started to notice a bad pain in my left side. It was like a pinching/burning pain and it seemed to come on slowly the more I sat in the same position. My immediate thought was that it was like a ""side stitch"" or a cramp from the way I was kind of slouching and not sitting upright in a chair. I quickly made sure to get a desk and chair to see if it helped resolve the pain. Unfortunately, it did not. The more the days went on, the worse the pain was getting and it only seemed to be when I was sitting for longer periods of time. I had to start getting up more frequently and walking around or switching positions. I went to a chiropractor which did not alter the pain in any sort of way. The same chiropractor also tried a few laser therapy sessions over the affected area as well, with no relief.  \nThe pain was gradually becoming a permanent thing, and it became painful to wear a bra due to the pressure it caused around my ribs/where the pain is. I was trying everything I could think of to relieve the pain. At first I tried ibuprofen, Tylenol, heat, ice, heating pad, icy hot, cbd muscle rub, cannabis,  \nThe pain continued on and I started talking to my then primary doctor, I had an x-ray done of my ribs 04/2020 - which showed normal. I then had a chest x-ray and chest CT done 05/2020 - also normal. The pain continued through that fall and into 2021. I had c\\*v\\*d for the first time 11/22/2020.  \nIn spring of 2021 I had c\\*v\\*d again in March, so almost right at 90 days since first infection. I then started to get more serious about finding out what was wrong because I started to have a new pain in my left collarbone. It seemed like the whole bone would ache and the more I moved my arms(I had started cosmetology school in the fall of 2020) the worse the pain got. Sometimes the lightest touch from my shirt, a tank top, my cosmetology apron, or even my seat belt resting on my collarbone would cause immense pain. This lasted about a couple weeks at first, then it would go away for weeks/months, then it would come back randomly. I went to the emergency room one day in 03/2021 because I was so tired of being in so much pain, and had more chest x-rays done, which came back clear and normal. The collarbone pain has not bothered me for about 6 months now, but I have also been pretty sedentary since then. Fast forward to 06/15/2022 after my third round of c\\*v\\*d the beginning part of June, I started having the following symptoms for a month straight. I was physically so unwell, I could barely get up from laying down most of the time and could not go outside due to not being able to tolerate the heat, until I finally asked my doctor to run more labs, which all came back normal: dizziness, night sweats, severe intolerance to heat, severe loss of appetite and nausea, and new body odor(previously never had an issue with body odor). Since then, I have had periodic episodes that last weeks with severe loss of appetite(cannabis is the only way I can eat most of the time), some mild nausea(never any vomiting), lethargy, feeling hopeless, very mild night sweats, hotter body temperature while sleeping. And then I\'ll have weeks where I feel fine except my usual pain. On 01/26/2023 I traveled to Punta Cana for my sisters wedding. I suffered through the pain of sitting for an extended period of time on the plane ride. While there, I virtually had no appetite my first night and the next morning/afternoon. And then my appetite came back and my pain went almost completely away for almost 4 days, until I went back home. I ate Taco Bell at the airport and had almost immediate pain from sitting on the plane again, and the pain has been present every day since.\n\n01/25/2023 Urology consult: CHIEF COMPLAINT: left sided pain; concern for Nutcracker syndrome. Impression: 29 FEMALE with pain that has been difficult to identify a cause and treat. She  \ndoes have a narrow angle between the SMA and aorta with slight dilation of the  \nleft renal vein. However, there is no pressure difference between the left renal  \nvein and IVC indicating that while there may be slight anatomic abnormality,  \nthis doesn\'t necessarily indicatee Nutcracker syndrome which would be  \ncharacterized by left flank pain due to elevated pressure in the left renal vein  \n(and kidney) due to compression of the vein. Additionally, her pain is not  \nclassic kidney pain based on description (stabbing/burning and anterior). Additionally, she has several indicators for possible Ehlers-Danlos and her pain may have a myofascial componenent.\n\n10/25/2022 I saw an Integrative Health Practitioner who ran some tests for celiac disease.  \ndeamidated gliadin abs, IgA - 4  \ndeamidated gliadin abs, IgG - 1  \nT-transglutaminase (ttg) IgA <2  \nT-transglutaminase (ttg) IgG <2  \nendomysial antibody IgA: negative  \nimmunoglobulin A, qn, serum: 51  \namylase: 73  \nlipase: 20\n\n11/07/2022 GI Consult outside of the VA, Impression: ""does not sound GI related in the slightest.

If you\'re reading this it\'s because you\'re either coming up to getting an MD (Microdiscectomy), want a MD (I did the same searches) or have had a MD and want to calm your nerves (literally and figuratively) regarding what you feel.**\n\n\n\n\n#Long ass Backstory, feel free to skip this if you just wanna get to my advice.\n\n\nI herniated my L5S1 disc around November 2020. Initially it was treated as a \'get over it\' sort of injury, people around me initially thought I did something to my hamstring because how could an otherwise healthy 23 year old get a spinal injury; my ex\'s physio convinced me that nothing was wrong and that I\'d be all fine and dandy if I just pushed through it. Of course, as the pain didn\'t improve, my lack of regular, known and friendly Doctor meant I wasn\'t really taken seriously till much, much later.\n\nAfter said ex kicked me out of her life because I just laid on the couch in pain (bad sign, if you don\'t improve after a few weeks SEEK MEDICAL HELP from a *GOOD DOCTOR*), I moved back home with my parents (funnily enough, that phone call I made to mum explaining how my life fell apart and I needed to flee home was captured by an Apple Maps Street View car. The LOWEST moment of my life is publicly viewable. I have it bookmarked and show people for a laugh). Embarrassing, but important. After a few months of being there, I knew I\'d have to \'start the process\' in whichever new city I moved to.\n\nOnce the move occurred, I sought out a trustworthy GP. Mum mentioned that as a child Lyrica was prescribed to me and it helped me a bunch and that I should go to talk to a doctor about it. I did, and it didn\'t really do much at the low dosage I was started on. In the end I was on 600, sometimes 1200mg a day, but I digress.\n\n\'the process\' is the pathway of increasingly severe interventions a Primary Healthcare Provider will request to help manage your pain and overall condition. Surgery is the last and most serious intervention they can request, they don\'t want to operate on you unless they know it\'s the only thing that will fix you. Call it ego on behalf of the surgeons, but the reason you have to go though with all of this is simple, you don\'t want surgery unless you absolutely need it. If a twice yearly injection \'fixes\' you, that\'s good news. Run with it. In my case, I got my first CT guided injection roughly 1 year after the initial injury. I couldn\'t really help it, the city I moved to is the city known for having the most lockdowns in the world, so even though I arrived in August last year, it wasn\'t until something like November or December that year that I received my injection. I don\'t know if it was the additional movement due to the lockdown ending and me finding work or the injection but I began to feel better, but that feeling didn\'t last long.\n\nAfter switching jobs to something I thought would be better (it wasn\'t), my pain got worse. Then, one day, I crashed my Electric Scooter doing something dumb to impress a girl (she didn\'t sleep with me again, boooooooo). Mum argues that is what made my herniation go from \'manageable\' to \'unbearably bad\' and although I disagree, it was around that time that I realised this new job was horrible and made my back condition worse. I was pushed out of that job by the incompetent asshole of an owner (your groans and cries of pain are off-putting to the customers perhaps you should consider another job). Never again. I left that job in April of this year and have been (sadly, not from a lack of trying) unemployed since.\n\nFrom there, I spent the next 4 months on my ass getting worse and worse. I\'d given up. Who can blame me? I was in crippling pain every day, my mood was super low and my dreams were shattered. I\'d moved to this new city hoping to make a fresh start and I\'d ended up being haunted by the ghost of my past. In those 4 months I considered either throwing myself in front of a car to cause Cauda Equina, throwing myself off my balcony to end the pain entirely, or going to hospital and telling them I wasn\'t leaving until I got surgery, cut marks on my arm notwithstanding. It sucked. I wouldn\'t wish it on my worst enemy, well, maybe my *worst* enemy, but definitely not someone I disliked a bunch.\n\nFrom getting referred to see a specialist and getting my second (ineffective) injection in April to seeing a specialist in August, I was in Limbo. This was the time where my left leg lost a lot of muscle mass and mobility, compounding the issues I was facing and making things worse. I was so fucking glad I had the scooter, I don\'t know if I\'d still be here if it weren\'t for me having it, I have no clue how I\'d have gone to get groceries or get around in general otherwise, was absolutely my \'mobility scooter\' for the entire time.\n\nSeeing the specialist in August was the first time I had hope in a long, long time. As negative as it sounds, being told that ""you can do all the physiotherapy, exercise, walking, well wishing and medication you want, but you won\'t get better unless we remove that thing from your back"" was the best thing I\'d ever heard. I felt vindicated for all the time I\'d spent languishing in pain, being told by bad physios that \'you just need to push past it\' (horrible advice, if you have a scan that shows a herniation larger than 1cm you ain\'t pushing past SHIT), taking more and more severe medication to control the pain, all of it for nothing to change. My surgery was a definite \'end\' date to this period of my life.\n\nI was classified as a category 2A patient. Category 1 is \'oh shit we gotta do something about this or you\'ll end up with serious damage/dying\', category 2 is \'oh damn we need to get you fixed up but you won\'t die or be left crippled from this if we put you on ice\' and category 3 is \'uhh, I guess we should operate, but you don\'t seem too phased by this so we\'ll see you in a year\'. Mum again thinks my scooter crash bumped me from a category 3 to a category 2, and if that\'s the case, I\'m fucking glad I did because I\'d have ended up on my ass either way, so if I get surgery earlier because of it I\'m happy.\n\nFrom there it was a waiting game. I was told 3 months was the \'recommended\' amount of time I should be operated within, but given the fact they couldn\'t operate on Category 2 patients at that time (my consult was via phone but they deemed my situation so important that I should come in, they even tried to keep me overnight to operate on me the next day, but the surgeon told them (and me) to get the fuck out because she literally couldn\'t do it) and given the fact that the public hospital system was broken and still remains broken, I wasn\'t expecting to get a surgery date until next year whilst simultaneously letting them know to just \'chuck me in wherever you can fit me, even if it\'s 24h notice\'. Once I was told I was getting surgery, I could also push my GP (doctors where I live are called GPs) to give me stronger medication. I was given Codeine paracetamol beforehand, and arguably too much of it because I developed an addition to it, but I could now ask for stronger medication because it was a \'make me comfortable whilst I await surgery\' sort of thing instead of a \'I need this to walk but not really walk just to sleep properly but not sleep properly mainly just not feel pain for a few hours\' sort of thing.\n\nBang on 3 months, I got the call. ""Hey, what\'s going on? you didn\'t respond to our email, we want you to fill out this form and get your blood test done so you can have surgery!"" Wish I got that call last week, because I spent the weekend languishing in pain, mental and physical. My surgery was less than two weeks away. Amazing. Mum cried a little, she\'s got so many back, shoulder, neck and knee problems and she knows how good it feels to be told that \'we will fix you soon\'. If you\'re waiting for that call, and I promise it\'ll come, it\'ll be like finding out you got your dream job, it\'s such a relief, the light was now visible at the end of this horrid tunnel.\n\nBut now my feelings of helplessness were replaced with feelings of concern and anxiousness. What will I do to recover? how will I get food? Will I reherniate 3 days after and be back where I was? I\'m completely alone, how will I deal with things like dishes, cleaning, organising things? Sure, my spoilt, child-like, \'I moved out of home but not really because my parents own this apartment and I see them 5 times a week anyway\' 23 year old housemate who has to be nagged to unstack the dishwasher let alone clean anything will be about as helpful as catnip at a dog show so yeah, completely alone; all of these questions now flew around my mind and caused me to panic, and I\'m mainly writing this because...\n\n\n\n#Here\'s all of the things you should do to prepare for your Microdiscectomy\n\n\n##Do a buttload of washing and clean your house\n\nYou\'ll need clothes. You\'ll need clear spaces, or at least clear spaces which you\'ll make messy but be able to clean up without bending, you\'ll need clean bed sheets, you ain\'t changing them for at least 6 weeks if your bed is in the corner like mine is, all of these things need to be done and they all need to be done before your surgery. A mate of mine came over to help me clean, mainly to keep me on task but it was important.\n\n##Have a plan for food and pre-purchase any heavy goods\n\nYou won\'t be able to carry anything heavier than a gallon for 2 months. Plan accordingly. I moved my microwave from below the counter in a \'microwave hole\' as I call it to on top of the counter. I didn\'t buy foods that required oven cooking, and if I did I didn\'t eat them until at least a week after surgery. I got a bunch of noodles, random fruits and veg, a bunch of these things called \'Zooper Doopers\' which are sticks of frozen sticky liquid which you either eat like a candy bar or bash on the counter to make into a smooth ice dessert,  whatever you like to eat get some of it and eat it during your recovery. I filled my veg crisper with lettuce, oranges, pears and carrots.\n\n## Treat yourself to some paper plates, disposable cutlery and plastic/paper cups\n\nLast thing you wanna worry about is doing dishes or stacking/unstacking a dishwasher. If all of your tableware is disposable, you won\'t have to worry about it or risk your back bending down to stack/unstack a dishwasher. Yeah, environmentally it sucks, but you\'re recovering from surgery. Remember, environmental atrocities are still being performed en masse by faceless, greedy corporations fuelled by humanity\'s desire to destroy the planet on which they live; fuelling the ever growing hunger for growth and dividends; the horrible late stage capitalism we all know and love. Don\'t stress it, the disposable cups, plates, bowls and cutlery won\'t make a damn difference (think globally act locally is a disgusting lie), I forgive you.\n\n##Buy a \'grabby stick\' or reach extender\n\nThere\'s no worse feeling, especially directly after surgery, than awkwardly picking something up off the ground or reaching to grab something. An example would be me forgetting my AirPods on the other side of my bed. Pre surgery me would have just reached over to grab them, post surgery me has to log roll his ass onto the bed, grab them, then log roll off the bed to leave the house. Get a grabby stick. My recommendation would be for one with a metal rod which directly connects the jaws to the handle. you can rotate the head, apply way more pressure to things than the string based ones and it won\'t break on you.\n\n##Have shoes you can put on whilst standing\n\nI didn\'t. First thing I bought  post surgery were a pair of comfy, slip on vans (platform with checkerboard patterns because I\'m secretly an emo kid from 2007), you don\'t wanna fuck around with laces, and I love laces, my normal boots are 11 eye Solovairs, I know I was drunk on a night out when I wake up with my pants around my ankles laying the wrong way in bed with my boots half off because it requires perseverance and gumption to get them off, so you\'ll want something that isn\'t that.\n\n##Don\'t over-prepare\n\nIt\'ll be tempting to do some whack shit when you prepare for your MD, especially if you\'re alone. I did a bunch of other things, but I won\'t mention them because it\'s pointless to do so. They didn\'t matter.\n\n#My recovery experience so far\n\n* Day 1 was me waking up from anaesthesia and walking around my ward a bunch and having troubles getting in and out of bed. They give you a bunch of drugs so you aren\'t in pain, but you should feel immediate relief.\n\n* Day 2 I got released from hospital. My mate picked me up and we went to a local market and wandered around eating cool food and getting harassed by meat vendors. That was such a special day to me, not only because I\'d just spent a day in hospital but because for the first time in years I didn\'t feel like I needed to sit down or take way too many pills to enjoy myself. It was great.\n\n* Day 3-5 was nerve pain free and very comfortable. I had drugs to keep me feeling good, my back was incredibly stiff and sore, but I could walk and found it incredibly enjoyable. Be aware that this is a temporary feeling. Walking after a MD is such an amazing and novel thing, but you are still beholden to your stiff back.\n\n* Day 6 I walked a little too far and stretched my leg a little too much and my sciatic pain came back. I legitimately though I reherniated. Despite the specialist assuring me that \'you\'ll know when you\'ve reherniated\', you\'ll think that any sciatic pain or general leg pain is you reherniating and feeling terrible. Funnily enough, that was the day I forgot to take my medication, silly me, wonder if that had anything to do with it.\n\n* Day 7-11 was really more of the same, I\'d feel better, do some whack shit (like walk 4 km, the furthest I\'ve walked in 2 years), suffer the consequences (I got goddam DOMS from **WALKING**. ONLY in my left leg), think I\'d reherniated, remember that I hadn\'t taken my meds, take my meds and feel A-Okay again.\n\n\n#Things I\'d tell someone if they were facing a Microdiscectomy procedure\n\n##Everyone\'s journey is different and it\'s okay if yours isn\'t the dreamlike recovery you see described here\n\nYou may not feel complete relief immediately post surgery. Sorry, that\'s just the truth. I did, and it was amazing, but it wasn\'t linear. Once the Lidocaine in my back wore off and I was out of Oxys I started to feel sciatic pain again. It\'s a horrible feeling, you\'ll think you reherniated and that it was all for nothing, it\'s kinda crushing. But you will continue to get better. I keep thinking \'damn this shit isn\'t working\' but then I remember I\'m less than 2 weeks out from getting operated on. I\'m not even meant to be driving a car let alone completely healed from this. Depending on how long it\'s been since the initial incident, you\'ll feel more or less sciatic pain post surgery. This is because you have other associated problems like nerve damage (which will repair itself), restricted range of motion in the affected leg, muscle weakness stemming from your aversion to using that leg (you know, because it hurt like hell to do) and other random bits and pieces. I, for example, have to lose 20kg (45lb) to fit back into my pre injury clothing. That\'s gonna suuuuuuck, but at least I can now.\n\n##You aren\'t going to be as fucked up as you think you will be\n\nWhen you hear \'spine surgery\' you think of stupidly long recovery times and a complete inability to do anything meaningful, I know I did. Reality is, most people are up and walking after surgery. I was. Sure, you might get worse in the few weeks after surgery, but I was pleasantly surprised by how ambulant I was in the days after surgery. I made hamburgers, went for walks, was able to pretty easily stand up for extended periods (and preferred it to sitting), Absolutely didn\'t need the 20L of water I bought to put in my room *just in case*. As long as you\'re careful, and trust me, you\'ll be careful, you\'ll be able to do a surprisingly large amount of things immediately post surgery. Heck, I put on and hung up a load of washing because my asshole housemate couldn\'t be fucked doing it whilst I was in HOSPITAL, dumping it into my basket and washing her own shit, leading to it rotting and stinking up. Ugh. But still, I was able to squat down carefully, put it in, drag it out, kick it across the floor, pick it up from the basket with my grabby stick and hang it up. I didn\'t enjoy the process, but I was able to do it.\n\n##Beware of the period after the initial stiffness dies down\n\nAfter about a week post surgery the overwhelming stiffness that forced you to log roll and be careful of your back will fade. This is both a good and bad thing. It\'s good because you know, healing, but bad because you\'ll have what I like to call \'oops moments\'. You\'ll forget you have had back surgery (yes strange I know) and and instinctively go to do something, only to feel something weird, scare the shit out of yourself and slap yourself on the wrist. I dropped my AirPods case in a gutter full of rain water (the case is fine thankfully) and had a little split second freak out of ""Oh shit, I need to grab that now. OH SHIT BENDING DOWN TO PICK STUFF UP REQUIRES CAREFUL PLANNNING AHHHHHHHHHH"" and very carefully squatted and was able to fish it out of the gutter. Phew. Other \'oops moments\' include:\n\n- Shifting around in bed and feeling weird pain from your back and freaking out thinking your reherniated\n\n- Hearing the door ring with the pizza you ordered and launching yourself out of bed instinctively only to catch yourself, flop back into bed and log roll out of bed\n\n- Having the dog step on your nuts (seemingly her favourite activity) and having to resist the urge to curl up from pain, or at least curl up in pain in a safe manner, something which is hard to do because a goddam dog kicked you in the nuts.\n\n- Having your phone fall off the bed and going to twist and reach for it, only to again catch yourself doing that, log roll out of bed and fish it out with your grabby stick (buy a grabby stick buy a grabby stick BUY A GRABBY STICK)\n\n- *NSFW* Going to jerk your hog and realising you can\'t reach it properly laying completely flat and straight so you go to bend your back like you always do, catching yourself and working out some other way of making that whole thing work.\n\n- Getting out of the shower and going to bend down to dry your legs, catching yourself, getting annoyed and instead letting those boys air dry. I\'d consider getting a Terry cloth bathrobe instead of a towel so you can just wrap yourself in it to dry off.\n\n\n##Old habits die hard\n\nWhen you hear you\'re getting a MD soon you\'ll start to think of all the amazing things you\'ll do when you get out of surgery. You\'ll go for big walks, get back into the gym, never take muscle pain for granted ever again, whatever. But old habits die hard. You\'ve just spent X amount of time doing very little in the way of movement due to pain. Even with the absence of pain you\'ll very quickly slip back into these old habits. I know I have. Surgery isn\'t the immediate cure you think it is, it simply removes the root cause of your overall condition. In my case, my left leg still has the same crappy ROM it had before surgery, that isn\'t fixed. That\'s why my leg will hurt after extended walks (extended being more than 1km), it doesn\'t have the same ROM as my other leg and because I\'m actively focussed on walking straight and consistently I end up being sore afterwards. This will take time to fix, and once you\'re given the green light to attend a physiotherapist you\'ll be able to begin fixing those problems and *really* recovering from all of this.\n\n\n##Start lifting mindfully and never, ever stop\n\nYou will have a weak spot in your back for the rest of your life. How do you protect it? By making sure the muscles that surround it are as strong as they can be. Right now they\'re weak, tight and fragile, like your back is. Eventually the Annulus Fibrosis will seal back up, but it\'ll be with scarred tissue. When you\'re recovering, talk to your physio about what you can do to strengthen that area and never stop doing those things until you die, or become so old you can\'t.\n\n\n###*Arguably the most important one*\n\n#*Your time suffering from sciatica has been a gift. Do not forget your pain.*\n\n*You have, in a sick way, been given a gift*. This gift is a glimpse into your future if you don\'t take care of yourself. If you get surgery, you get to leave the pain cave. Many people don\'t get that luxury. This is your gift. Cherish it, remember it when you don\'t feel like going to the gym, doing your stretches or going for that run in a year\'s time. Never, EVER forget the pain you lived through, the dreams you had of not being stuck inside your home, unable to exist in the world as a healthy, ambulant, productive member of society, completely hopeless and alone in your suffering. I won\'t ever forget that time, it was horrid, easily the worst time in my life, I\'ll probably get some sort of tattoo to etch it onto my skin to ensure I don\'t ever forget it.\n\n#Suffering from Sciatica was the worst time of my life, and I\'ll do whatever it takes to make sure it stays that way.\n\n\nBoy, that was a long post. I don\'t really care, you don\'t get a TL;DR. I\'m glad I got to write down my thoughts, and if it helps anyone I\'m glad.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions about what I discussed or any questions you have in relation to the process. I\'ll probably make a post at the 6 or 12 week mark, see how I feel about it.\n\nAlright thanks for listening.'"

I had a few cavities filled in and a filling that had fallen out replaced all for about $85. Turns out you get what you pay for because when I came back to the US that new filling fell out after a few months. I went to get it looked at and was informed by the American dentist that looked at my xray that all my overseas dental work had been horribly botched and the cavities had just been basically puttied over and were now much worse. He told me I'm looking at several root canals and over $8K worth of work. It was a really unprofessional chain place so I think it may have been over exaggerated a bit but none the less I have a gaping hole in a tooth and no money to fix it. Whenever pain flares up I chew on a clove and stick the pieces in the hole which seems to work. Recently I've been reading about all these people who have died from blood infections from their teeth and now I'm getting pretty worried, what are some symptoms to look out for and how serious is the situation?

Low and behold, when the adult tooth comes in, its noticeably discoloured and misshapen - Im talking a 30 or so degree angle, chocolate brown streaking, and generalized yellow discolouration at the tip of the tooth.\n\nAside from that, everything is pretty straight, good size, and never needed braces. But this front tooth had been a major point of insecurity, people made fun of it, and I avoided smiling with teeth or opening my mouth too much at all cost. \n\nAt 13/14 years old I was getting root canal for a back molar (didnt have dental coverage so it got REALLY bad before we could get it fixed). The dentist pointed it out and asked if I wanted it shaved down so the edge was straight and most the discolouration gone. Obviously, the other (normal) central incisor would be brought down to match. I was ecstatic and agreed without much thought or consulting my parents. Relief of having the most noticeable discolouration passed  pretty quickly. \n\nI wasnt really buck toothed before,  but the width was complimentary to the length (of the non-malformed tooth) and for over 10 years now Ive just felt stubby. Dont get me wrong its better than before, but still a big point of insecurity.\n\nBasically all I hear people talk about/find information on are expensive veneers. But I have concerns with strength (being the central incisors) and cutting caffeine (Im a nurse in a pandemic, sorry the coffee has to stay). \n\nSo if anyone has recommendations on what other solutions I can look into it would be very appreciated!

She said if I think it\'s POTS, she\'s not going to consider giving me a stimulant until I get back in with my primary doctor and have some tests done (the only one I\'m aware of is the tilt table test?) because stimulants could interfere with my condition too. According to my research, stimulants can still be used with people who suffer from dysautonomia. I feel she made up this excuse because she secretly thinks I\'d abuse the medication I was actually hoping for- maybe something like vyvanse.\n\nIt is possible I have EDS because the physical therapist who assessed me found a lot of hypermobility in my joints and it\'s common among autistic people, however, dysautonomia-like symptoms can also be attributed to alcoholism, an eating disorder, and psychological trauma which are definitely in my past. \n\nAnyways, I guess when I\'m done with physical therapy, I have to go through the hassle of getting a whole new provider. If she\'s afraid to give me medication with an abuse potential, I\'m not going to ever move forward in life with her on my treatment team. I need to work with people who trust me. I\'ve already tried stratterra and wellbutrin in my youth. Knowing this, she should have at least been a little more open minded to giving me something that would actually work. She\'s also just a nurse practitioner. I probably need someone who is a legitimate psychiatrist. \n\nBlood pressure issues aside, someone else explained to me clonidine is a second line treatment for ADHD that should not be taken as the sole med for it. Can you imagine how screwed I\'d be if I had agreed to take that crap and not checked what it would do to my blood pressure? She already set me back when I decided to try lexapro for executive dysfunction sometime last year. It made me a lot worse and caused some erratic behavior in me. It took me months to slowly recouperate from that. \n\nI am discouraged and overwhelmed because it\'s going to take months to get the tests I need, months to probably get in with anyone decent anyway, etc. I also don\'t drive and I know my mother is going to give me a hard time if the care I need ends up being in another town. She sees me as a burden and is not all that supportive. Neither is my father. He told me I\'m a hypochondriac and there\'s no way I have all the conditions I claim I do, that it\'s all in my head and part of my mental illness. I\'m beyond sick of his gaslighting. I\'ve had issues paying attention and not being able to sleep at night and other problems associated with ADHD since childhood. I wish my parents wanted me to be successful. It\'s like they just want me pigeonholed here and within their range of control for as long as possible. I feel trapped sometimes. \n\nI\'m going to be 29 in late August. By my age, I should be on an ideal medication combo and a functional member of society. This is ridiculous. I just want to get myself in gear for college however I can. That way I can earn a place in the world away from them. A normal parent would be like ""How can we support you and your pursuit of authentic living? How can we help you thrive and succeed?"" I don\'t think I\'m entitled to say I deserve doctors who actually care that I can function in day to day life, meds that work for me, and a better family. \n\nOne more thing: I find my pain awfully distracting as well. It\'s to the point my pain doctor might put me on codeine as a ""last resort"" if I explain celebrex isn\'t cutting it. Although it\'s a huge maybe, is anyone else on pain meds, ADHD meds, and bipolar meds at the same time? It just seems like a lot of medication and I\'m wondering if I will have to choose between codeine or the vyvanse. Codeine lowers blood pressure anyway sooo I\'m not too thrilled about that. I know if it is dysautonomia like I suspect, maybe a stimulant would mess with the test and it does make sense to wait for what I think might help, but just...the slap of carelessness from suggesting the clonidine makes me feel neglected. She\'s been talking to me every two weeks for about a year for crying out loud. \n\nI hate how hard it is to advocate for myself. I like doing research, but I wish doctors were more interested in improving my life. I wish I didn\'t have to do all this research on my own. I\'ve been trying to get better for a long time and it seems like no matter how much work I put into my wellness, it doesn\'t pay off much. \n\nI suppose that\'s all for now. Thanks to anyone who bothers to read this. I know it\'s long. It still feels like it\'s missing some points too.'"

anticonvulsant vomit,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/758w6s/newly_diagnosed_also_have_chronic_illness/,"b'Newly diagnosed, also have chronic illness'",,"b'So, this is a long, overwhelming story and I am sorry for that. I had been taking Seroquel, usually 100mg, sometimes up to 200mg, for years to manage, in my head, mainly insomnia and chronic weight loss/malabsorption, for maybe ten years. I was suddenly diagnosed this year as borderline diabetic by my endocrinologist (I have massive overall health issues due to a benign brain lesion) caused by stress. I was about 99 lbs at 5\'5"", lifelong vegetarian, former yoga instructor, never drank soda...I actually studied diabetes in graduate school and never thought it could happen to me.\n\nSo I had to stop that suddenly. I wasn\'t on any other psych meds at the time (primary diagnosis is PTSD, secondary SAD/depression) and I went into a state that vaguely resembled the two periods I went into crisis in the past - when I was on super high doses of SSRIs. This appears to be a mixed state. Only by removing the Seroquel, which I\'d been taking since like age 20, did the Bipolar 2 reveal itself.\n\nA lot makes sense now about my behavior, but I never thought I had such a strong biological issue. My sister has pretty severe, classic OCD since age 7, she\'s successfully managing it. Father is lifelong addict and there\'s so many addicts in the family, I wouldn\'t know if anyone else is bipolar. No one else is diabetic.\n\nI have lost almost all my relationships (friends, family) due to being too sick to have a social life like my peers, and the periods of hypomania and aggression that messed up everything. I am really unsure what to do. I meditate daily, I have very bad insurance but I am trying to find a psychologist. I finally, reluctantly started Latuda after Lithium was a bust. I cannot take lamotrigine as I would be on too many anticonvulsants at once, and when the neurologists have done that in the past to prevent pain, I become too stupid to work or function. \n\nI am a super high achiever in work and academics. But these disorders are draining everything out of me. I do not know anyone as a friend who has mental illness this severe, except one friend who is pregnant (I will not burden her at this time; she has severe depression, well managed with meds) and another who also has lupus (severe ADHD and OCD) and does not deserve to always have to pick me up when I don\'t know how she does it herself.\n\nMy main issue right now is I. Cannot. Focus. On anything that isn\'t like racing physical hyper task, which I\'m not even supposed to do because I\'m 5\'5 and 94 lbs, and the doctors do not want me active until I am in the triple digits. Never been above 115. All day I struggle with different symptoms and try to manage my blood sugar, mood, headaches, vomiting, GI issues, muscle spasticity, and I am starting to feel like a hungry ghost instead of a person. And I chain smoke and hate myself for it; I started at 14.\n\nI am sorry this is so long. I also work in a profession where it would be damning for this to be discovered about me. It is bad enough about the tumor. I do not want to feel like my life...like I never got a chance to live it. \n\nI\'m single, live far from friends and have trouble driving, and I constantly want a hug. It\'s pathetic. I\'m sleeping cuddling with my childhood stuffed animal and my real dog, too. I think I will always be alone. \n\nThank you to anyone who read this nonsense. '"

Lots to unpack here, so if yall dont have the time, I dont blame you :) \n\nIm a 24 year old man, and I lost my mother to terminal metastatic breast cancer last Christmas Eve. She was only 63. It was all very sudden, we only got the diagnosis that it came back roughly two weeks before she died in hospice. Since the age of six when my father left for a pack of cigs, and up until I met my fianc who was there with me through the entire process, it was me and my mother against the world, so we were extremely close throughout the rest of her life (call me a mamas boy if you want lol, I wear that badge with pride these days). \n\nAs next of kin, I was the one who had to call the shots for her in the hospital and hospice when she lost her mental acuity. It felt very defeating, having no other choice but to sign off on letting doctors pump her with inhuman amounts of drugs to ease the pain. A cocktail of Hydromorphone (Dilaudid), Fentanyl, Ativan, and other drugs I cant remember the name of, administered through a PICC line is what finally did the trick to make her comfortable. Although I was just trying to make her inevitable passing as peaceful as possible, I still feel this immense amount of guilt. I feel like I had a hand in killing her, or in this case, a signature. \n\nI know its been almost four months at this point, but I still feel like I havent crawled out of the haze and shock that I found myself in at that time either. The dust has settled, but I havent. Going through the motions of work and life to distract myself is getting old. \n\nFunny enough, about a month before her death, I quit my antidepressants after five yearsWonderful timing, but I think Im doing alright all things considered. This isnt my clinical depression coming back or anything, just grief. \n\nMy father and I dont talk, as our relationship is unfortunately irreparable. He never reached out when I told his new wife that the mother of his flesh n blood was dying. I cant contact him in any way, he has me blocked on every platform. The prick wants nothing to do with me, and Ive made my peace with that. Im not exactly at an age where I need a parent anymore, much less that guy. \n\nWith ALL of that being said, I guess my question is, to those have gone through similar situations: when did you start to feel okay again? When did that void in your heart feel less empty? Do you still feel guilt over your experiences in hospice, and if not, when does it end? \n\n\nThanks for reading yall, have a great rest of your day '"

So, please feel welcome to ask any question in case I got that ratio wrong! I\'ve read enough health websites that I\'m pretty tolerant to suggestion now. If I\'m not sure, I\'m not sure, and I\'m more likely to forget I have a symptom than overstate it. (This came up recently; a doctor asked if I had a symptom, and when I said I wasn\'t sure, he basically told me I didn\'t because I\'d know if I did. I asked my husband later and he said, yeah, he could tell I was visibly struggling with that symptom.)\n\nI am a woman, 30 today!

Over the years, I haven\'t really related to any telling PCOS symptoms other people with PCOS complain about. My new gynecology office\'s first comment was, ""You don\'t have PCOS, though, you don\'t have any of the signs."" So, this one is iffy for me. My non-PCOS-focused birth control they put me on works just as well for my issues I was having. But I\'m just happy it works!

If I do more, I\'m tapping into reserves, and I pay for it.\n* Body aches that feel bone deep\n   * I recently had really sore muscles and the aches simultaneously; when I went to take a shower, I noticed the warmth really soothed my muscles but didn\'t seem to touch those aches. It was really distinct in that moment. I just don\'t know what it is. They aren\'t phased by warmth, cold, movement, pain killers, NSAID\'s, turmeric, etc. I drink rarely, but my brain either spaces them out or feel a bit better when I\'ve had alcohol, so that one pain killer has been effective.\n   * These are most intense around my arms and shins (around the humerus and tibia), especially near the top of those areas. When they\'re more intense, they skip over my elbows/knees and seem to ache through the next long bone.\n   * They are not affected by movement, but they are worsened with anything not resting, kinda like having the flu.\n   * I got super, super sick around 2014 or 2016, I think it was? I didn\'t notice I was sick because the symptoms weren\'t as bad. I eventually began to catch on when my windpipe, lungs, tonsils, ears, sinuses, and tonsils were inflamed. It didn\'t actually click until I lost my voice entirely. My fever was so high I was heating our entire hotel bed. I just thought I was in the early stages of a flare and refluxing. I was told these symptoms didn\'t exist, so I just... ignored them. :c\n* I don\'t know where to put this one, but I get a really, really intense urge to pee when I lie on my left side.\n   * I think this has been around for a few years, but I had no idea what was happening. I just kept waking up needing to pee. As it\'s gotten worse recently, I realized it happens every time I\'m on my left side, and is greatly relieved by standing up, walking around, going pee, or just rolling over onto my right side. It is mildly agitated on my back, but if I\'m really determined, I can ignore that level. I\'m so tired of lying on my right side, though. I dread sleeping because it\'s not comfortable to wake up every time I roll over in my sleep. But since I\'ve made the effort to sleep on my right side, my mysterious issue where I wake up needing to pee after 15 minutes of sleep has disappeared.\n* Tremors (hands, legs)\n   * These can start anytime I\'m upright and doing anything. If I add exertion and heat to the mix, they\'re very visible. A little caffeine seems to settle them, and of course, an overdose of caffeine is... not helpful.\n* ***new*** Little bumps across my abdomen\n   * I found my first little pinhead bump around April, it\'s near the outer edge of my ribs just over my stomach. At the time, my stomach was so sensitive that it was painful to wear a shirt and walk down stairs. When I found it, it was so sensitive, I\'d immediately feel like throwing up and passing out, so I\'d let it go. For the next few days, I\'d feel really unwell. This one has remained roughly the same size; it\'s not as sensitive as it was when I found it, but I still feel unwell when if I accidentally give it a good poke. I have another one in a similar spot near the other side of my ribs, but it only hurt when it first came out.\n   * Many hurt in the area when they first come out. They don\'t hurt themselves unless they really get probed; they mostly hurt the area around them. I usually just feel some ouching and tenderness when I poke the area, then a few hours later, I\'ll feel the pinhead. It\'ll eventually grow into a little lump.\n   * They are hard, some are moveable.\n   * They\'re coming in more and more quickly now. Some are only palpable when I\'m lying down, some when I\'m standing, some when I haven\'t eaten, some when I have. If I catch them at the right hour, my stomach feels like a bean bag. But I don\'t really know how to get someone else to feel them. I know where they are and the angle to hit them at to feel them because my subconscious is telling me about them \\*constantly,\\* like that ready-to-go scab you absentmindedly pick off even though you didn\'t know you had a scratch to begin with. It\'s like my subconscious is trying to tell me about them. I never would\'ve found half of them if I wasn\'t focused on something else entirely, then suddenly realized my hand was poking at one.\n   * Most of these aren\'t visible so far, only the swelling.\n* My right collarbone swole up one day around March. I put my hoodie on in the morning, and when I took it off at night, it was swollen. \n   * It hasn\'t changed much. It doesn\'t really hurt. It is the length of the bone. So, I thought it must be the costrochondritis buddy that effects collarbones, so I thought I\'d give it a couple months. I can\'t tell if it\'s changed, but it absolutely has not gotten any better. I don\'t have any sensitivities  or tenderness described in the articles on the collarbone inflammation types, including the costrochondritis.\n\n>Respiratory\n\n* ***new*** Difficulty breathing lying down\n   * I think this has been around for a bit, but I always wrote it off as issue with reflux. Now that it\'s more severe, it\'s obvious it\'s unrelated. It does not respond to reflux care and feels, somehow, different than when reflux rubs a nerve wrong.\n\n>Gastrointestinal\n\n* Nausea\n   * Some of my nausea isn\'t too bad, but I\'ll get nausea when I take a bite of a food that is a warning; if I eat more, I\'ll be in a bad place. If I proceed anyway, I can be severely nauseated for days but won\'t throw up. I had food poisoning for the first time last year, and it was the first time I\'d ever just... thrown up. I\'m still in awe. It was so, so easy. The nausea was so low level I almost didn\'t notice it and originally had to swallow it down because I had no idea the nausea meant anything, and it was there for just a short bit before the action. Then I just... felt better. It\'s something I have always heard people complain about, but if I had food poisoning instead of my food nausea every time, I\'d honestly be living an easier life.\n* Low appetite\n   * I\'ve been trying to stick to fist size or smaller meals once or twice a day, no snacks, or my appetite and nausea get really out of whack. They\'re small enough portions that it wigs people out to see. This has been more of an issue this past year. While my weight has been stable, I\'m fairly certain that some calorie watching (I don\'t have the energy to weigh out my jalapenos) has me under 1200, even when I\'m rounding up, on days where I feel like I\'m eating too much. Yet my stomach keeps growing.\n* Reflux\n   * I\'ve recently read an article that reflux that agitates your windpipe and can go up to your nostrils and ear canals isn\'t GERD but LPR? Mine usually gets those areas. If it hits elsewhere, I generally don\'t feel it.\n* My stomach won\'t stop growing. I have swelling where my left ribs become my stomach, and it\'s gotten so big it started having a little roll. I have some swelling like it starting on the right side of my right ribs. I feel really gross and huge.\n   * I feel like I should eat less, but I also feel like I need to eat super calorie dense to make it through the day when I\'m struggling to get portions down. I\'ve had days where it feels like my brain is just tilted sideways and won\'t turn on until I finally convince my body to take a little food. These bouts have not caused any weight loss. This is really messing with me, guys. I\'ve had a few mini breakdowns over trying to figure out how to navigate this. \n   * I got down to 150 a couple years ago before it just started inching back up and will not go down unless I\'m netting 700 or fewer calories or less a day, which obviously isn\'t sustainable. If I rebound back to \\~1200 calories a day, the weight comes back like it was water weight. It\'s stupidly frustrating. My eating habits, however, never rebounded; my sensitivity to fats and sweets has only gotten more severe. I naturally eat lower calorie food in smaller portions than I did while religiously counting on MFP.\n* We once thought I had ulcers. We\'ve never found one, so at this point, we don\'t think that\'s what\'s going on. My stomach is a little sensitive all the time. When I lie super flat on my back, I get intense, sharp pains in that left corner of my stomach, so I generally side-sleep to minimize GI symptoms and this pain.\n\n***Tests I\'ve had***\n\n* Endoscopies (multiple; most recent in May showing bile reflux)\n* Colonoscopy (including biopsies for IBS, Crohn\'s, celiac\'s, etc.; all negative)\n* Feces test (normal)\n* HIDA scan of gallbladder (said it was a bit low but not abnormal and not a source of my symptoms)\n* Ultrasounds of gallbladder only (normal)\n* Ultrasound of abdomen last Wednesday (showed gallbladder sludge, no signs of stones)\n* Autoimmune screening such as ANA, sedimentation, etc. (all normal)\n* Blood panels such as metabolic and CBC\'s (normal)\n* Thyroid likes to jump a little sometimes, but has only once in 10+ years jumped over 2.0, and wiggled its way back down to 1.6 when we monitored it.\n* Reproductive hormone panels (normal)\n* Urine tests (normal)\n* ECG, EKG, Zio patch last summer (normal)\n* Stress test last fall (heart rate went really high and it ended early)\n* Brain MRI (2018 for post-concussive headaches; normal)\n* Heart MRI (\\~2014 or 2015; normal)\n\n ***Some things I\'ve tried***\n\n* Went to a therapist specializing in physiological symptoms caused by psychological sources Jan 2020-\\~Octish 2020; she determined I have no signs of depression or anxiety, have healthy coping mechanisms, and didn\'t find a connection between my symptoms and mental state. She concluded I wouldn\'t benefit from further sessions. \n   * This one stings to be dismissed so frequently because I went hoping this was missing the link here. It felt empowering that working on that missing link could set me free from this. I\'ve spent so long managing my mental health that it sounded so easy and doable. I also spent many hours looking through every therapist in the area to make sure I was looking at someone who really had an interest in this topic and could help me really dig into it, and she did. We spent hours talking about the hardest parts of my life and how they impacted me and what I took from them and what I put aside from them. It was a dead end; I don\'t have resentment and anger from any of it. It was nice to talk, though.\n* Gluten free\n   *  My husband was diagnosed with celiacs last year, so I actually eat GF most of the time to avoid CC\'ing him. I really, really promise I don\'t feel worse when I do dip into regular celiac-killing soy sauce. \n* Dairy free\n* I eat corn, soy, rice, etc. on rotations, so I\'ll occasionally pick one and intentionally avoid it. I haven\'t noticed a change off or on them. I really don\'t seem to react to foods unless it\'s fake sweetener, which seems entirely normal, or my trigger foods (fatty, super sweet, alcohol, etc).\n* Talking to a dietician (\\~2014)\n   * She said I seemed to have a really good handle on nutrition and healthy outlook on foods, portions, cooking, etc. I think I\'ve only gotten better and better at it since then, even when I am craving something really not-good. For example, I have stopped taking ""personal watermelon"" personally.\n* I eat protein!  I intentionally seek protein and fiber out as my top sources of nutrition.\n   * I really get this one a lot, especially because I must pass on most things you\'ll see at a barbecue.\n* I eat less sugar than people watching their sugar because, well, it really agitates my body. I will admit some post-cookie-nausea has gotten me through some low-cal periods in my life.\n* Monitoring for healthy sleeping habits\n* Forcing myself to exercise\n* Getting super depressed while on tricyclic antidepressants; the relief I felt off of them helps reassure me that I\'m not depressed and don\'t know it\n* Vitamin D and sunbathing\n* Willing the unfindable anxiepresson away\n* Trying every pill they suggest until I give up because (a) it\'s expensive and not affecting my symptoms or (b) causing side effects on the ""call your doctor immediately"" list.\n* Developing a potentially real addiction to Gaviscon as of 2020.\n* Asking the internet (most recently, this post)\n\nI may have missed something, so again, please feel free to ask any questions! I\'ll update this post with any details anyone requests.\n\nRight now, I\'m at a point where I went about the lumps in my stomach and difficulty breathing overnight. They told me it must be viral and will go away, but they\'d do an ultrasound. The ultrasound came back with sludge, so they said that would cause my symptoms so wait and see if it gets worse so they can do further workups on my gallbladder if it does.\n\nI\'m due for a follow-up with my latest gastroenterologist who, in our first and only visit so far, has recommended I do a CAT scan on my abdomen. \n\nI am just so tired of going in for tests to come back normal and being told I just don\'t know I\'m anxious, and should really deal with my unmitigated undiagnosed anxiety. It\'s really, really messing with me. I keep trying to will away my symptoms or force a narrative that they only appear when I\'m stressed when I damn well know that isn\'t it. I just want to know if there\'s anything I should go in armed with. I feel so defeated but I can\'t be because I\'m running out of strength to pretend this all isn\'t happening. I need help.\n\nIf you\'ve made it all the way, thank you so much, it means the world to get any opinions. Thank you so much!'"
antimicrobial problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/5imtcx/hello_fellow_adhders_dental_student_here_just/,"b""Hello fellow ADHD'ers. Dental student here, just wanting to share a friendly PSA about your meds and oral health!""",,"b""The problem: Pretty much all of the meds prescribed for ADHD cause xerostomia (dry mouth). This includes all stimulants, and intuniv. Dry mouth is a huge factor in getting tooth decay and gum disease. You saliva naturally has antimicrobial components (like dozens of types) which reduce the bad bacteria. In someone with chronic dry mouth, bacteria accumulates on the gumline, not on the occlusal/top of the tooth like you normally think of. Even with regular brushing twice a day, you can still get cavities. \n\nYour options:\n\n1. Get a professional cleaning and evaluation every 4-6 months (more frequent than people who aren't as high risk. These are official guidelines for anyone taking these meds). It's expensive now, but when you're risking paying for $2000-3000 to replace a single tooth, it's a really good investment. \n2. Dry mouth options: Biotene mouthwash is fantastic. Use that several times a day. Also Xylimelts by OroCoat is a tablet that goes on your cheek and helps day and night. I personally love these, especially at night. Gum with xylitol is also good. \n3. Make sure you're brushing properly, especially for you guys. Your brush should be at a 45 degree angle and using a soft brush, make sure you get the gum line. The idea is to clean in the little pocket between your gum and your teeth. This is where the bacteria proliferates in dry mouth\n4. Use toothpaste with lots of fluoride. Sensodyne is my recommended brand. You can also get prescription toothpaste with even more fluoride. You can also get prescription fluoride rinses. Additionally, your dentist can give you MI Paste/recaldent which you just brush on at night and don't spit out. It reverses small lesions on your tooth that haven't had enamel break off. \n\nIt sucks that we have this challenge, but this is really important to save you money down the road. Dentistry is insanely expensive if you have wide-spread cavities. The office should send out reminder cards to make appoints, so that's some pressure off of you! \n\nIf you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them!\n\nTL;DR: If you're taking ADHD meds, you need to take extra steps (above) to prevent you from paying tons of money in dental work later because you're at a high risk for cavities."""

However, I have doubts regarding what is causing me these mild allergy symptoms as I'm also taking an antibiotic (started the treatment 10 days ago) and the molecule is Doxycycline.\n\nIsn't it surprising that my allergy to the bonsai is a brand new symptom and that it doesn't affect my eyes at all? Shouldn't the symptoms be the same as what I usually get with pollen allergy?\n\nCould it actually be the antibiotic? After checking for potential side effects I found out that generalized itching is the main effect of allergies to that antibiotic.

I was prescribed xanax 1mg for sleep for 4 years back when doctors didn\'t think it was the plague. Anyways as more research came out and the world learned about the negative side effects of long term benzo use my doctor ripped my prescription away and I was left not sleeping at all on average about 4 days in a row. I thought it would get better over time but it never did and I\'ve landed in the er multiple times from psychosis, blood pressure so high I was at risk of cardiac arrest and not to mention I haven\'t been able to attend school, hold down a job and my insomnia is now affecting my social life and destroying my mental health leading to many nights of contemplating suicide. I\'ve tried years of therapy, CBT, CBT-I, tried years of safer longterm use medications that help with insomnia but all they do is make me extreemly tired but they don\'t stop my brain that spins 1000 mph all night so I end up being exhausted and still wide awake wishing I could sleep.ive done rehab for dependency but ended up going into psychosis and back in the er. I\'ve worked on cbt techniques, meditation, exercise, natural supplements and nothing phases me my mind seems to overpower the will to sleep. I ended upselfmedicating xanax 1mg every night  and it worked for a good while, I wasable to sleep, I never increased the dose, I helddown a job for almost a full year and was evenable to get into a relationship. I was happy but Iknew that I couldn\'t keep this up for the rest ofmy life because I feared I eventually I would get caught,and also the big thing was i picked up 100 xanax from a new connect and they ended up being\npure fet, which led to me becoming addicted to opiates. Anyways I\'m 6 months clean from opiates and I\'m in iop and after explaining my story my therapist and counselor said that at this point it would be the lesser of two evils to be prescribed an effective sleeping medication like ambien, lunesta, or a benzo specifically for sleep than to live the rest of my life sleep deprived, in and out of the er, and all the other dangers of sleep deprivation\nhave an appointment this week with a primary care doctor, what would be the best way to convince this doctor that I need to be on an effective sleep medication for life, because at this point I am desperate for sleep and either I am monitored under a doctor with this\nmedication or I go back to self medication and accept the consequences. 10+ years of torture. Currently I am taking remeron 60mg every night and I get about 2 hours of sleep every 3 to 4 days.

cipro,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/12pumdd/struggling_with_frequent_urination/,b'Struggling with frequent urination',,"b""Hi all. I have not been officially diagnosed with any anxiety conditions, but something really strange started happening to me last year. One day, I suddenly felt the urge to pee more frequently. Drinking the same amount of water, peeing the same overall volume as before, but just feel the urge to go more frequently, usually peeing out only a little bit. I feel the urge usually every hour, or every 30 minutes on really bad days. I used to be able to go 2-4 hours without even thinking about needing to pee. Completely random, happened out of nowhere. I also started to experience hesitancy, with my stream having a bit of a delayed start, as well as stopping and starting mid-way. Later that same week, I started to feel some kind of internal tremor near my pelvic/groin area. Not something that you can see or feel from the outside. Fast forward to today, and I still have these symptoms. However, the tremors have sometimes started to travel to other body parts, such as my feet, legs, and torso. But it mostly hangs around the groin/pelvic area. Sometimes my heartbeat feels really loud/strong. \n\nI did a whole bunch of tests with my primary doctor and a urologist, including blood tests, urine analysis, and cystoscopy. No infection, no UTI, normal prostate, no diabetes, no scarring/strictures, bladder is voiding completely, bladder looked normal from both ultrasound and cystoscopy, unremarkable abdominal ultrasound. Blood levels are within normal values, electrolytes in normal values. The only thing that my urologist commented on during the cystoscopy is that my urethral sphincter was unusually tight and narrow, and is the possible cause of my premature urgency feeling (the urethra is surrounded by muscles, meaning that it's possible that it's the muscles that are tense). I'm a pretty healthy guy overall. \n\nSince all my tests came back relatively normal, I started to think that it's maybe anxiety-related. I've always been an anxious guy in general, but it's never manifested as physical symptoms before. Also, I'm not consciously anxious about anything right now. \n\nI've tried medications such as Flomax (tamsulosin), Cipro, ibuprofen, beta blockers, anti-histamines, and OAB medications (oxybutynin and myrbetriq). I've also tried magnesium supplements, electrolyte supplements, pumpkin seed oil, and multi-vitamin supplements. None have seemed to work so far. \n\nHowever, the funny thing that further convinced me is, I got LASIK surgery last week. Before the surgery, they gave me a low dose of Xanax to help relax myself before the surgery. After the surgery, I felt like my urinary symptoms got better *a little bit*. But now it's back to before. \n\nDid the Xanax do something? \n\nIs it possible for physical symptoms of anxiety to persist even though I don't mentally or consciously feel anxious about anything?\n\nI'm thinking of asking my doctor to do some tests for my hormone levels, such as adrenaline, cortisol, thyroid etc, to rule out anything endocrine-related. My last resort is investigating into cardiovascular or nervous system issues.\n\nThank you!"""

The only medical condition I have that I\'m aware of is Asthma but other than a couple of instances of exercised-induced Asthma during strenuous exercise in cold weather, I haven\'t had any trouble with it in over 20 years.  Currently taking no medications but was given IV vancomycin and IV Zosyn for 4 days, and Bactrim and Doxycycline by mouth for an additional 7-10 days, in late September after an operation on my toe for a lawnmower accident.\n\nI woke up on November 5th with this outbreak on my head. It\'s mostly on my forehead but there are also a few spots under my hair and a few behind my ears. It looks a little better now than it did initially but has mostly stayed the same for the past 3 or 4 days, It doesn\'t hurt and only occasionally itches, although I would liken the itching to more of a very light tickling sensation.\n\nThe skin on my head is very oily and has been for as long as I can remember so I was thinking it might be something related to that. Also worth mentioning is the fact that I regularly wear a beanie and I did in fact wear one recently after it was washed in a new laundry detergent.

barbiturate problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/4jj37d/facing_a_bipolar_diagnosis_and_i_am_struggling/,b'Facing a bipolar diagnosis and I am struggling',,"b'I was diagnosed with depression in December 2010, and I have taken a multitude of anti-depressants since then, some effective, some less so - some effective for the first month or three then a major crash, blahblahblah. A list of antidepressants I have been prescribed includes (but may not be limited to the following, I have memory problems) fluoxetine, citalopram, mirtazapine, amitriptyline and sertraline. A doctor once considered venlafaxine but I went for the sertraline instead.\n\nAnyway, I don\'t want to have a huge post so I will try to cut short. My original December 2010 diagnosis was just ""depression"" and then after a few years and multiple different ADs my doctor just said I was suffering from resistant Major Depressive Disorder (i.e. not situational, not going away by itself or with the use of first line drugs). I was offered counselling, I agreed to go - unfortunately I was not told it was a group conselling programme like AA or NA and that was not something I felt comfortable with at the time. I was younger, more anxious and I couldn\'t face it, so I didn\'t go after all.\n\nIn August 2010 I had a weird experience where I became randomly, out of nowhere, excitable, motivated, yet utterly depressed still. I was agitated if I kept still, I could not stay in the house for longer than 30 minutes - I had to keep moving, keep busy. I walked about 7 miles every day and spent around 12 hours outside, alone, from 10am until around 10pm. Doing nothing in particular, I just had to keep moving - when I did, I felt free, I could breathe, I was content and things were good. But when I stopped or sat still, I wanted to kill myself.\n\nI went to my GP as this was not an experience I have had before, thinking it may be a hypomanic or manic state - I know that bipolar is usually misdiagnosed for years. Anyway, she was worried, I had not slept for 3 days, so she referred me to the Community Mental Health Team (CMHT). She gave me diazepam to help me sleep. They didn\'t work.\n\nI was assessed at the CMHT and was deemed low priority due to my diagnosis being ""just"" MDD, and they said they didn\'t think it was a hypomanic or manic state as although there was agitation, no sleep, needing to keep busy etc. my mood was actually low and depressive. Fair enough. So I received almost a year\'s worth of CBT from them rather than any other programs or treatments.\n\nJanuary 2015 I overdosed on barbirurates and benzodiazepines after my boyfriend broke up with me. It was not a suicide attempt, and I am so thankful that I lived, but also that people UNDERSTOOD that it wasn\'t a suicide attempt. It had been around 5+ days since the break up, I was still sad over it, but getting better. The problem was I could not get any sleep at all... after 4 or 5 days of no sleep, you become stupid and reckless. That is how I overdosed on the barbiturates and benzodiazepines. It helped that I had lots of both available and it was obvious that I hadn\'t taken even say 30% of them, whereas apparently people with suicidal intentions take the whole lot. So that was on my side. I didn\'t die, I was OK.\n\nThere have been numerous ups and downs since January 2015, but skip to January 2016. I has been feeling increasingly low since November 2015 and it was getting too much. I was prescribed propranolol for anxiety (benzos were sort of avoided because... well, the above), and my sertraline was raised to 150mg.\n\nAnd it felt fantastic. I had a solid 3 weeks of feeling amazing. My mood was great, I felt the best I had in over a year, I was so motivated, I wasn\'t doing just my own job at work but doing extra work. Fantastic. But two coworkers noticed this sudden change in my behaviour and spoke to our manager saying they were worried about my behaviour and personality change. \n\nMy manager who is a pharmacist suggested it was me probably just getting used to the drugs after the increase. So we gave it a few weeks. The happiness and everything was good, I just kept trying to be less excitable/loud etc. at work so people would not complain.\n\nThen in March/April... major crash. I was having neurological symptoms such as major memory loss and confusion, sleeping for 16 hours in weird places and at weird times... I got an MRI scan and an urgent referral to a neurologist.\n\nThe neurologist has sort of cleared me, he said I have a sleep disorder called REM behaviour disorder meaning I sleepwalk/talk/act and basically I was so tired all the time and sleeping for so long because my ""sleep"" wasn\'t actually restful or refreshing. I was spending too long in REM sleep and my body was acting my dreams out. Spending too long in REM means skipping sleep stages as well which is apparently why I was unable to remember things from the day before... my brain hadn\'t had chance to process them overnight.\n\nLong story short, he wants to prescribe clonazepam for the REM behaviour disorder. But obviously after the January 2015 overdose we have a potential issue there. He said it should be fine, once I spoke candidly about the context of it all, the fact it wasn\'t to get high or suicidal, just a desperate need for sleep, and suggested that we could just do prescriptions for 10 nights at a time for the first few months, if it made me feel better/safer. I thought it was nice how he didn\'t just say ""hell no"" to the clonazepam; in fact it was his suggestion and he basically said there is no other pill we can give you that will work as well for a parasomnia like this. He said I must avoid the three Z sleep drugs cos they can make it worse, and he wants one that will make me sleepy, reduce my REM sleep (I am jumping straight in to REM, so a drug that reduces REM is actually a good thing for me in this situation even though it is a bad thing generally), one that will keep my muscles relaxed (to reduce the likelihood of acting out my dreams and sleepwalking etc.) and one that isn\'t too long-acting like diazepam because I do actually work when I am not on sick leave and any drug needs to be compatible with a normal work life. He also said whilst diazepam is a great muscle relaxer it takes too long to take effect and lasts too long. So clonazepam it is.\n\nBut then at the end, he said we need to get to the root cause of my REM Behaviour Disorder, particularly because it is sort of new and only started a month or 2 ago. I told him about the complaints at work in January, I told him about August 2014... he knew I was depressed, I asked if that could have an impact, he said yes.\n\nThen he said, as well as a neurologist, I am actually qualified in Psychiatry as well, and I am able to work as a Psychiatrist as of 3 years ago. So I am like - this is brilliant, killing two birds with one stone.\n\nThen he says it... ""I think, quite probably, that you have bipolar disorder"". And I have thought it was possible before... In August 2014.... In January 2016............ but I\'m usually so low all the time, I never seem to have any huge manic periods or hypomanic incidents. But he said I was thinking about it too much and had been biased over what I know about bipolar (I teach Psychology) and how I probably think of it as the extremes. He asked if I looked it up before, I said yes loads of times for both personal reasons and work reasons. And I listed all the symptoms I don\'t have... and he was like yes, but the ones that you do have are the most important ones.\n\nSo. Because he saw me that day as a neurologist rather than a Psychiatrist, he would like me to see a second Psychiatrist for a second opinion and formal diagnosis (even though he is qualified, that is not what he was working/employed for at the hospital I saw him at). He said not to worry and how it is a good thing as after 7 years I may finally get things sorted. I cried and said that\'s all I want, to get things sorted. I felt relieved. He said forget the stigma, forget what you read, see or hear, just go see this second Psychiatrist when I get the appointment, and if I am diagnosed with bipolar we can work something out between me and the Psychiatrist and how it will be much better in the long run. I spend 90% of my time depressed and 10% of my time super happy and motivated, but also anxious about when it ends. To have an antidepressant that works would be fantastic and for one to work for longer than a few weeks or months (I always thought that was just the time it took my body to get used to it - turns out it was probably just hypomania from the SSRIs as I was obviously not on a mood stabiliser or anything else) would be a great bonus. I left the hospital feeling relieved but slightly anxious.\n\nThat was 5 days ago. Now my mood is in the gutter, I just feel like crying, and I am so depressed I just want to sleep forever. I will obviously not take anything extra to help with that due to... the reasons previously highlighted. But that is how I feel, really depressed, anxious, tired. I just want to sleep for a week or 3.\n\nSo I don\'t really know what this post is about. I am sorry it is probably just a useless wall of text. I guess I am just facing a potential, more than likely than not, bipolar diagnosis and it feels like a whole new world. Some good, some bad - the goods being I might get better treatment tailored for the condition rather than just having SSRIs thrown at me, the bad being... well, having bipolar.\n\nI know depression is tough. I know bipolar is tough. I know it won\'t be easy. But if anyone would be as kind as to share their stories about how they got diagnosed, what happened immediately afterwards in terms of medication and treatment, and whether you feel better in the long term after being diagnosed. I guess my biggest worry is if I am diagnosed, but if things don\'t get better. If I get the right diagnosis, and the right treatment and things still don\'t start getting better... that is what I am worried about. At the moment I have hope, but also anxiety. Because I really want to feel better. And I don\'t want the label and stigma that comes with being diagnosed as bipolar, if I actually don\'t feel any better for it, if that makes sense?\n\nSorry this is so long. It is almost 3AM here in the UK.\n\nThank you. '"

When I was in HS I was diagnosed with anemia and took supplements for it. \nMy periods at times were so bad my friends and boyfriend had to carry me to class due to being unable to walk/move. When i started having sex, it was painful. \n\nIn 2018 I had a copper IUD placed as I told my DR I didn\'t want hormones. My periods did not get better but did not get worse. They would last around 10-12 days and I have an EXTREMELY heavy flow. Talking like, change a super tampon every 1.5-2 hours AND soak through maxi pads 5-7 times a day. Around this time, I changed to a menstrual cup, leading me to dump every 3 hours or risk bleeding through a maxi pad and my clothes. \n\nFast forward to june of 2022 and i start seeing a hematologist as i had been at work one day (medical field) and complianed of some symptoms which led the NP to run a hemoglobin on me and i resulted at 5.6. I was sent to ER and referred to hematology. I started getting iron infusions in July of 2022 and my Dr noted that while the Infusion should last 6 months, I was lasting 2-3 till my iron and hemoglobin dropped again. He believes it was due to my periods, and I was set up with GYN who was dismissive of me and I stopped going to him.\n\nSept of 2022. I started my ""period"" and noticed after 2.5 weeks I was still bleeding. My flow was heavier and more painful than usual. I called a PCP and I was scheduled to be seen in Jan of 2023 for this and other health concerns. \n\nMy bleeding stopped in November , I had a ""period"" in December, and then January 23 2023 I began to bleed heavily. At this time I saw my PCP who sent me to a hospital for a uterine and transvaginal ultrasound to check for tumors, fibroid, polyps, cysts, and thickened endometrium wall. He also stated he believed it was due to my IUD and stated if the US was normal, he would remove my IUD. \n\nFeb l. 23 I had the US done which showed no findings. My PCP met with me a few days later and stated he would remove my IUD and place Mirena in the same day as I did not want two procedures done due to sexual assault and medical trauma. He told me he would order the IUD and call me when it was in to schedule removal and placement.\n\nMarch I was still bleeding, and March 10th I began to pass uterine/blood clots the size of a mandarin orange/golf ball. These were one solid clot, and not multiple pieces stuck together. They were also squishy and not hard. I passed approx. 1-2 a day. \n\nI called my SIL on March 12th who is an OBGYN/delivery flight nurse who told me her hypothesis was that my IUD was implanted and that the menstrual cup was causing suction and trauma everytime it was removed from my vaginal canal. \n\nOn March 13th, i was still passing clots and in immense pain. I called my Mom\'s OBGYN who delivered all three of my younger sisters, told him who I was and his treatment of my family, and the story, and he had me come in same day for an emergent visit. He stated he also believed it was my IUD and my cup and removed my IUD that day. Bleeding stopped 3 hours after removal. He also stated ""I have removed thousands of IUD\'s in my 40 years and this one had the most clotting I\'ve ever seen"".\n\nThe next day I came back to him- at this point I was spotting- for a follow up US. He told me after reading it I had a benign cyst in my right ovary and a 2-3cm polyp in my uterus. He scheduled me for a D&C on April 19th and put me on Estarylla for treatment of the cyst and would follow up with me to make sure it did not grow. \n\nI have been on Estarylla for 6 weeks now and started taking the sugar pills 2 weeks ago (estimated). I woke up on the 3rd week of taking BC pills and began bleeding heavy. I began bleeding through 1 pad every 30 minutes (not maxi pads, as they have started giving me intense irritation from the dyes, bleach, and carcinogens. These are just super pads) and changing super tampons every half hour AND STILL bleeding through my clothes. I have stopped using a menstrual cup, as a lot of the providers at work think the cup could be causing the clotting or the blood is clotting in my cup and that\'s what I am seeing. I DC\'ed my cup just to be sure. I am currently not on an IUD. \n\n3 days into the 3rd round of hormonal BC pills, I started passing the large clots again. My pain was INTENSE, started as a sharp right sided pain that has spread/radiated through my whole lower abdomen and back, onset April 8th. I have used midol, Naprosyn, Tylenol, ibuprofen, heat packs, and have gotten a shot of dexamethasone, ketorolac, and promethazine with no relief. I was crying all day every day,, my back and abdomen would just HURT. I was nauseous and can barely bend, breathe, or walk. \n\nOn April 10th, I called my OB, and he told me I could get Norco from my work, as I was not allowed to take anything but acetaminophen 10 days prior to surgery, but acetaminophen did not touch it. The NP at work did an abdominal CT to check for a ruptured cyst causing free fluid in my abdomen. My blood work and CT were normal. I went home and took Norco and woke up 2 hours after taking it due to the severity of the pain. \n\nThe next day (April 11) I went to the ER per my OB because of the pain. They did an ultrasound and pelvic exam and ran urine and blood work and it was all normal.\n\nIt is now April 23rd. I\'ve had to buy a cane to walk because I have shooting pains down my left leg, I get numbness and tingling in my left arm and fingers. My pain starts in my back where my reproductive organs sit and radiates through my whole body, but i cannot stress this enough: the pain is in my bones. I feel like i constantly have knives or nails being driven into my bones, all over my whole body, but especially my extremities, and worse in the left side. My lower left leg constantly feels like it is being crushed in a vice. Every once in a while I get sharp, shooting pains in my bones. I have had no recent trauma\n\nMy bleeding has stopped, and my D&C went without issues, but the pain does not let up. Norco still doesn\'t touch it, heat barely helps. I wake up and go to sleep in pain. My whole back feels HORRENDOUS and my legs are weak. I am extremely fatigued, depressed, and emotional. I am having migraines every day.\n\nOther associated symptoms; lightheadedness/Dizziness with random onsets, no syncope, a constant pressure headache that feels like it\'s in my whole skull, loss of appetite, extreme fatigue, loss of feeling in my left fingertips, irritability, depression, soft stool with an urgency to go, pain and numbness during and after sex in lower back and legs, and pronounced bags under my eyes.\n\nApril 18th I saw my PCP who said my blood draws show negative for risk of leukemia (I was worried about this so I asked for a read of my labs) and imaging shows no tumors in bones. He prescribed me gabapentin because he thinks it could be nerve pain, but it provides no relief. \n\nIf you read this all...thank you. Thank you so much. I have asked so many medical professionals, i feel lost and hopeless.'"

So for some reason i had extreme mania which i dont every remember having in my life for a couple weeks.The conserta is actualy helping me i dont feel wired feel normal but can remember stuff short term more now and focus.so the problem was whe i was on the serequel and id take it im used to antipsychotics so i get super sedated but i had two instances of intense visual hallucinations. So my hallucinations have always been auditory never visual so I was so freaked out when i saw my moms face I went to the ER the first time.Then another intense one happened like recently the first was like month or two ago.So i know antipsychotics block extra dopamine and stop hallucinations. For some reason i didnt think of this as alarming but one day it all clicked. Here are some examples of stuff i saw .In the pitch black i can see the silhouette or outline of some objects but they would start morphing or if i turned on my fan the sound while i closed my eyes sounded like someone slowly stepping on my floor which is carpet so id have to tur the fan to a lower setting.Another thing is one night i Looked at my fire alarm by my door and theres just 1 little green light but wen i stared at it like green particles started swilring larger then the light and i was following it with my eyes then id unfocus or focus and see the dot but the same thing would happen.Also I can see a dim light by my window and would see what looked like crossthreades moving like worms and stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other weird thing is you know how you can like repeat a sentence in your head in someone else's voice well i was getting rapid sounds from my friend then my mom and it wasnt of my own will like its just going super fast and sayign things i would never think of like captai of the banana mesh so liek real words and like weird shit. So this was still going on before i took the conserta for adhd.So out of nowhere all that stuff clicked in my head like i should tell my psych about this and the racing thoughts of weird tings when i felt heavily sedated from serequel wasnt making sense.So i called my psych which she was going to call me two days later to see how the conserta was doing with me.  The night before she called i left my computer on for a night which my computer has blue lights so my room was like not dark but tinted a dim blue but i stared at the wall and so if you think of like a little transparent grain of rice but like seeing like too many to count ont the wall vividly but i knew it was coming fromy my eyes like floaters because when i looked left and right it followed so it wasnt on the wall it was with my eyes and if i coused it condensed from looking like a bunch of little bugs bouncing off each other and i mean it looked like transparent rice grains just bouncing off but like 100's but when i focused they would condense to a swirling kind of motion so my psych called and she put my serequel down to 150 and put me on 1 as of now pill of 500 mg depakote and she said she starts people on two sometimes but im at 1 for now.She was trying to tell me that there are things called illusions because my brain is overstimulated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also noticted this stuff only happened at night in darker settings when i tried to sleep.I thought it was weird i was sedated heavily yet these weird familiar things in my head sayin weird words rapidly didnt make sense.SO i guess when the brain is overstimulated it can make illusion kind of stuff i dont know.I was basically giving a back story of the meds and why they happened.My question is I take xanax and klonopin when needed only dont use any substances not even alcohol.I take 300 mg wellbutrin and 36 mg conserta at the same time every morning and at night i i was taking 300 mg serequel  and montekulast sodium tablet which is an allegy med every night now tonight is the second night of taking 150 mg of serequel which i had a hard time sleepping in fact i have slept yet because im used to be sedated to sleep so i feel like wide awake  and it is 5 pm and i woke up 1 pm yesterday. I was just wondering since this is the first night taking this mood stabilizier.  It says becautious when you drive so im assuming it has soem affect that may make me feel dizzy or whatever and i rad serequel and benzos can cause it to be more intense so my first question is is there anything i should look out for watch for or interactions I havent looked up yet and also i look into meds but havent looked into mood stabilizers and have no general idea how they will make me feel in general."""

NSAID swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/10mcfzx/extraction_pain/,b'Extraction PAIN',,"b'I had an extraction for a broken molar, second from back on the bottom left. I was told the tooth pain would ease after removal. I like to think I have a high pain tolerance, but maybe Im sorely mistaken. Tomorrow will mark one week from extraction, and the pain is debilitating. I thought dry socket, there was some white pus substance day one, the evening of extraction. I thought it was food and tried to (gently) remove it with tweezers, seems it was tissue so I quit after some quick, strong jabbing pain. I have the tendency to grind my teeth and the extraction has made the urge stronger. Its the only thing that eases the pain, if only for a moment. Chasing the dental dragon. Ive noticed swelling so wonder if its infection vs dry socket. Dont want to go back to the dentist, they did me a favor by getting me in quickly at a reasonable price the first go-around as a new patient without insurance. Trying honey, it hurts also. Lots of nsaids after running through my norcos. Doesnt do a lot but help get me to sleep for an hour at a time. The pain never alleviated after extraction, they yanked on it, tore gums and twisted it all about but the numbing did its job during procedure and a few hours after. The pain has consistently existed but did get worse on day two, and worse each day since. My socket was never full of blood but I think I may have left the gauze in too long after extraction. It was always wet & I switched it out but intrinsically felt that the longer the better. I dont see bone but the coagulation is no where near the top of the socket. The covering went from white to white with green specks, lining the bottom of the socket. Will this resolve on its own if I can grit through the pain? Or am I destined to an embarrassing call with my dentist?'"

I have suffered from somnolence as my sleep has always been very aggressive (screaming , shouting, kicking and things like that) . \n\nI have never taken any medication for anything related to mental health but here i am :) \n\nFirst i tried Concerta but didnt go well with it, then Elvanse that went way better for me. Then a very small dose amitriptiline before bed for my sleep and that has made a huge difference. Wellbutrin for over 6 months now and it has been the best one (even better than Elvanse) for physical energy . \n\nSo ... i have been sleeping 8h a night and it has been great ! I wake up feeling rested and no need to nap as i used to (for years and years) . \n\nBUT i feel that my low grade depression and low mood is still the same. I also suffer from endometriosis (advanced) even though with the pill i dont have any pain. My prolactin levels is around 20 - 30 and that is higher than the range but not enought to think it is a pitituary thing.. i looked around and it has to do with endometriosis . It could be this or something else but i have ZERO sex drive. I dont even think about it but i have a partner who do :P \n\nAnyway, Abilify / Aripiprazol has been suggested from my doc as a way to lower prolactin but at the time i have said No right away .

corticosteroid problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7ryeeg/long_read_not_sure_whats_going_on_with_me_right/,"b""[Long Read] Not sure what's going on with me right now, has ANYONE had a similar experience and dealt with it?""",,"b""Hello and thank you for reading this in advance and sharing your opinion also I apologize as Im not very articulate. Also I realize after writing this that it kind of sounds like Im asking for a diagnosis but I promise Im not, Im more just venting and asking for peoples opinions who may have gone through similar situations.\n\nFirst a little background on me, I am a 27 year old male, Ive never had any trouble with my mental health up to this point, even after going through some very traumatic family scenes, and have dealt with my stress very well in my opinion. I am a sufferer of Crohns disease, have been diagnosed with it since I was in the 3rd grade but even that has never bothered me mentally. I was working out consistently, making good progress in strength and my physique and was feeling pretty confident in myself, I was studying for my new job willingly, I actually enjoyed studying it every day. But all of a sudden things fell apart on me.\n\nIt seemed to just hit me out of absolutely nowhere 2 weeks ago and has been going on ever since, the night it started I was going to bed and my nose was clogged and my ear felt like there was fluid buildup and I couldnt breathe very well and for some reason I got extremely agitated and worked myself into a panic because I couldnt go to sleep as a result of it. This happened once before too a few months ago, but at that time I was very sick with a terrible sinus infection but once my nose cleared then I was able to go to sleep perfectly fine. But this time the mental effect has seemed to stick around because I think I've associated nose congestion and fluid in ear feeling with not being able to sleep. Even though this time I was not really sick (maybe just a small cold), and can actually breathe good again now, I still cannot for the life of me fall asleep and worry to death all day about not being able to sleep and I feel like my diaphragm area is very tight and not taking in as much air as it should even though the doctor said my O2 saturation was good and my breathing rate was also good. So Im pretty sure that my sleep is the main problem because ever since that happened 2 weeks ago it has been like a domino effect on my mental state. Im not really depressed as far as I know but I'm not sure because I don't THINK I've ever been truly depressed, I've been very, very upset and angry but nothing like this, my emotions are practically gone, I cant laugh, I dont feel sad or hopeless although the hope is going away after these 2 weeks, I just feel nothing, nothing other than the fact that I can't sleep irritates me, and I know Im very bothered by it because I catch myself pacing through my house often, though this has calmed down a little the past few days. My sex drive just randomly disappeared along with this (was very healthy sexually before this, literally the day before) and my cravings for food also vanished, I was also eating perfectly normal before this too. No food I see or smell wets my appetite or makes me hungry, so I bought a weight gainer powder just to keep my calories up and I dont starve.\n\nMy ability to yawn is gone too which is really strange, I can feel them coming on but my body will not let them come out or fully complete. Which also bothers me because Ive associated sleep with yawning. And Im sure this is because I notice it happening and my mind stops it. \n\nBut one of the strangest things in my opinion is I have had 3 or 4 moments which lasted a few hours over the past 2 weeks where it seemed like the entire problem went away randomly and was suddenly able to crave food and eat normally, laugh, relax, focus on tv shows and feel healthy sexually again, and even felt the need to take a natural nap, but once the day winded down and I started worrying about sleep again the emptiness comes back and erases the entire good feeling.\n\nIt's to the point where I lay in my bed and either I keep repeating a thought (song lyrics or some kind of sound bit from a tv show) over and over again in my head or I would feel like I wasnt actually in my bed and I was detached from my body or I wasnt me, almost as if I was dreaming without actually being asleep. There was also a moment where my mind wouldnt actually think of anything at all and it seemed like I was just staring at a black wall of no thoughts, this I kind of think was a result of the sleep deprivation. And when I finally fall asleep I will only sleep maybe 30 minutes to an hour, then Im back up again pacing back and forth worrying about sleep. The best way I can explain the way it feels when Im able to sleep is my subconscious will play a bunch of random images or thoughts and I can feel them right in front of my eyes, but now the thoughts are very few and feel like theyre coming from the top of my head (I realize this makes me sound worse lol), and my ears seem to be very active like I'm actually focusing on everything I hear while I'm trying to sleep. I normally have very vivid lucid dreams which I absolutely love to have, even nightmares, and wake up feeling so relaxed and refreshed the next day, but now they have also stopped. It feels like the more I actually think about the problem and trying to fix it is what makes it so much worse.\n\nMy physical ability hasnt been affected really by this, I can actually play video games and puzzle/word games better than I have ever been able to since this happened (extreme focus?) and I can still drive my car at essentially the same level as I could before granted I'm not running 36+ hours straight of being awake. Im still able to talk to people easily, actually a little bit more open since this happened though not as happy and jokey as I usually am.\n\nI do notice that my touch sensitivity has decreased, I can still feel things but nothing is really sharp feeling, I had my friend slap my back open handed just to test and I noticed that it didnt sting I just felt pressure of the slap and nothing else. But I'm hoping this is just another symptom of sleep deprivation.\n\nI feel like I also need to mention that I was on corticosteroids for months before this for my crohns and feel it could potentially be an adrenal gland issue? (Unlikely, but just throwing that out there)\n\nI went to the doctor for this and was prescribed ambien which has been helping me get progressively more sleep each night I take it except for last night it didn't do anything at all. because I felt like I was able to eat and chose to do that which I think ruined it since it was supposed to be taken on an empty stomach, but even when it does work I dont really like it because it doesnt feel like a natural sleep and Im also afraid of developing a habit.\n\nHas anyone ever been through something like this? Am I just  doing this to myself, worrying myself to death for absolutely no reason? If so, how do you go about this? Does it seem like something that would go away with some meditation or do you think I should pursue some more medical attention?\n\nPS. I would just like to say as someone who has never really had any instances like this, I could never quite understand how people who were going through these things truly felt. Now I know and have so much more empathy and sympathy for people so that's a positive thing that has come from it. And also it has made me personally realize that I would much rather feel emotional pain than be numb because I feel as if my soul is just ripped out of me, and I hate it so much.

I didn't expect much with side effects and neither did my derm tell me to worry about them. In the past month, I started having on and off pain in one of my toes. I didn't think much of it; figured I probably had a slight sprain as I'm reasonably active. Last week, after a dance class, I went home and noticed my toe was extremely swollen and hurt. It didn't go away overnight so I went to a podiatrist the next morning. He said the spironolactone may be causing uric acid to build up and therefore causing the inflammation. He gave me naproxen and told me to take it twice a day for 10 days. Two days later, I go to work. Horrible stomach ache, chills, fever, dizzy, headache, cant seem to stay awake, very thirsty, no desire to eat but feel starved even after eating. \n\nI wasnt able to see a doctor because, well, I cant drive in this condition. I did text a friend whose a pharmacist and she was shocked I'd be prescribed an NSAID (naproxen) with spironolactone. She told me to drink pedialyte because I might be losing too many electrolytes. Spoke to another friend whose in rotations right now and he said that my taking omega-3 supplements would also not mix well with the drug. Basically my blood pressure might get too low, other meds increase chance of the side effects (which clearly seemed to be happening), etc. He basically called my doctor an idiot since I put all medications on my medical history. \n\nSo. problem now is that 1) I have abandoned all medications and I'm not sure what to take and how to take it. 2) My doctor and I don't mix with schedules until saturday morning\n\nWhich is why I'm hoping someone has some insight.

NSAID problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/nulgs3/stomach_problems_and_acne/,b'Stomach problems and acne',,b'Hi everyone! I wanted to see if anyone else was dealing with what I am going through right now. Currently I am only getting nodules or cysts as im not really sure the difference between the two. But they are all very swollen and red. I realized that I only get these when I start having stomach problems which I have had issues with for the past 6 months. Its very strange because for the last 6 months I have had constipation for half of each month which is when my face would break out. It doesnt seem to be triggered by anything in particular but as a precaution I have limited gluten and dairy intake. I do believe that it was somehow caused by a 6 month treatment of oracea(20mg doxycycline) primarily because the medication was listed as a NSAID which is known to cause constipation. For the past 6 months I have been off the pill and I actually started to feel my stomach healing and my acne getting better. Until recently I started taking the anti acne club supplement which after being on it for a month caused me to break out again and have worsened stomach problems. I dont think its a bad product I just dont think it was right for me. Even after I have been off of it for a couple days my constipation and breakouts have remained which prompted me to search up any connection between constipation and acne. I wasnt surprised to see that there is a big connection between the two. So im planning on buying some fiber supplements to help regulate my bowel movements which I am thinking might help my face. I hope this helps someone and I hope im not the only one with this issue!'
gabapentin,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/12jjr94/bizarre_5day_sensory_overload_followed_by_crystal/,b'Bizarre 5-day sensory overload followed by crystal clarity?',,"b'Hello. Im sharing this because I dont think Ive ever experienced anything like it before, and would like to know if any of you have had something similar. \n\nIve been asked by both NTs and NDs throughout my life (friends, dates, etc) if Im on the spectrum, but never really looked at the startlingly obvious bigger picture of life history, family and comorbidities until a few days ago when I was in the middle of a horrendously painful sensory overload that lasted 5 days. It was a bit of an epiphany. \n\nMy entire sensorium from Friday to Tues night was basically jacked to volume level 11. I spent all of Sat/Sun in a dark bedroom. Any amount of light hurt my eyes. Smells were super intense. When the cat used its litter box across the apartment I noticed. I tried to eat a food I eat normally (blueberries, granola and kefir) and I was extremely nauseated. Sounds hurt my ears. I couldnt think. I typed all my symptoms into Google and found that this sensory overload looks an awful lot like autistic burnout but can occur in Tourettes (which my brother was diagnosed with) and ADD (which I was diagnosed with, amongst other ASD comorbidities like anxiety, depression, dyslexia, infrequent absence seizures, and an eating disorder). \n\nThis episode came after a week of WAY too much stimulation, 10 hrs on a plane, 24 hrs in a party house of 40 people Id never met before, a 500-person math conference and the afterparty and several nights of going out with colleagues who were in town for it during 2nd week of new job. And then the overwhelm hit me like a freight train. \n\nYesterday (Tues) I was still quite sick through midmorning and was dry heaving over the toilet.  Then everything suddenly relented by 85% but I couldnt *think*. It was like Id been hit in the head and my ADD was uncontrollable even with medication. \n\nToday I woke up to crystal clear cognition and a sense of calm and optimism, and was able to do a super intense hour-long 1:1 meeting about my task of overhauling a blockchain data analytics system with my FAR more experienced coworker (Ive been in the space only a year and this is a new job of 3 weeks ago, first in the space; hes been in it for 7 years). I didnt miss a beat. I came to a solution. It was really complex DeFi analytics code. And I was startled by this high-functioning flow state. No impostor syndrome (crypto is mostly dudes on the technical side and Im literally the only one on my team without facial hair), no weirdness, I just dove in and connected a lot of dots. \n\nIt was like my brain went mega ASD symptomatic, and then popped out rebalanced and clean and able to hyper focus on technical problems like I did as a kidsome of the best parts of it, in my opinion. The clarity is bizarre and wonderful. My ADD calmed TF down tooits a 2/10.\n\nHas this happened to you? What just happened? What is this? \n\nAny insight is greatly appreciated. Im still learning about my brain in this new context, which would explain 90% of my eccentricities, bluntness, social shortcomings, sensory intolerances and sensitivities, etc. Scheduling an evaluation soon.'"
penicillin swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/wtao0n/any_stoppedearly_success_stories/,b'Any stopped-early success stories?',,"b""I (31F, mild-moderate hormonal acne) started my course in April and reached 5,400mg total. Cumulative dose for my weight (123ish lb) is 6,695-8,400. I haven't had a pimple for about two months. \n\nI stopped Accutane Monday at the suggestion of my derm: late June, I had a few spots pop up on my face that itched and secreted honey-yellow fluid that dried into a crust. (If this happens to you, TELL YOUR DERM IMMEDIATELY.) My derm diagnosed impetigo and prescribed a topical antibiotic, then an oral antibiotic (doxy) when the topical alone didn't work. She took samples to culture, but due to scheduling issues, they were too close to when I finished using the topical antibiotic to grow anything. The topical/doxy didn't work, but it was manageable - two or three small spots around my nose/cheeks - until a week ago. My derm didn't want to prescribe another antibiotic without a culture to know what specific strain of bacteria we needed to combat; a combination of travel and insurance issues meant the second culture was postponed. \n\nLast Friday the impetigo overtook my face and neck (possibly because I sneezed into a mask and couldn't wash my face for a solid hour). I started a round of Bactrim Tuesday, and when that didn't work, Penicillin on Thursday - which is *finally* working. She took samples for a culture on Tuesday and they're not back yet, but thanks to the failed doxy and Bactrim, chances are high that it's caused by Group A Strep that I've carried in my nose for who knows how long. Normally, a healthy skin barrier prevents nasal-carry bacteria from causing skin infections; an unholy combination of weakened skin from Accutane, busy immune system due to Covid in June, and a skin allergy (dermatographia) making all of the inflammation worse meant my skin couldn't deal. \n\nThe all-over impetigo is/was the most pain I've been in in my adult life. It felt like my skin was badly sunburnt at first and progressed to feeling like my skin was actively being burnt and peeled off. It hurt to move my face, it hurt to not move my face, and the swelling was so bad I could barely see. Understandably, this is NOT an experience I want to repeat (and again, if you have itchy sores that ooze yellow fluid, TELL YOUR DERM IMMEDIATELY).\n\nI'm off Accutane to give my skin the best chance to heal. Chances are slim that the impetigo will come back, because a successful antibiotic treatment should kill the root cause (and I've been militantly cleaning/bleaching everything my face/neck touches), but it's still possible. My derm mentioned yesterday that she might suggest me stopping Accutane altogether just in case, and to be honest, I'd rather deal with the mild-moderate acne than more impetigo. Other complicating factor is I'd like to try and have kids in the next year, so a longer-term low dose regimen to finished my course isn't super appealing. \n\nTL;DR: severe skin infection meant I paused Accutane at just over 3/4 of my cumulative dose. Possibility of the infection reoccurring means I may not go back on Accutane. \n\nHas anyone stopped at a similar point in their dose? Did your skin stay clear? Did you use any topical?"""

After losing everything again, had no choice but to move back to Moms 18 months ago\n\nI had tax issues I never dealt with, should have been much sooner but the pandemic, Dads cancer death..so many things. So instead of working, just been hanging around. Still weighed 330 July/21, but with walking I cut down to 305 late 2021 and currently 255. I should be feeling great no? Not really \n\nAround December 1st, I stopped my walks and going outdoors almost cold Turkey. Had recently developed bad heartburn but improved my diet slowly while losing weight. 12/8 I couldnt sleep at 4 am, went downstairs to watch TV and suddenly felt my left pec just get a jolt, same time as my head. Panic, take aspirin phone 911. EMTS took good care, after a 32 hour wait I find out its not my heart- they assured me thats why I waited so long. Also had a treadmill test last Easter which was A-1, come to think of it thats the chest pain started the prior November when I was starting to indoors a lot, again! \n\n12/29 I go to mall for a walk and check my BP, which was improved to about 125/85 prior month. Saw a high # and just panicked before I sat and calmed down. Drove to 2 more stores, still had bad anxiety, bought a Smart TV, then went to pharmacy and ran into a friend I made at the hospital. Calmed me down\n\nSo I made an appointment with Doctor for Friday the 13th, but Wednesday after not having eaten for 24 hours, has a sandwich and Boom same chest jolt . Try to relax @ head upstairs but couldnt make it 1 step- laid down heart racing played soft music and OK after 30 minutes\n\nDoctor 1/13 prescribes Zoloft and Dexilant. Stomach is not so much the issue, just fart/burp a lot & chest gets tight if I dont let it out ASAP.

Pharmacist came around & calmed me down & gave me my pills, but it took all my courage to walk the 100 feet to Moms car. Scary\n\nWe live in a 4 level townhouse. All I do since I got the new TV is struggle to go down for 1-2 meals, then back up to my room on bed. Im terrified of exercise or the outdoors. \n\nSo could this  all be a Vitamin D deficiency? I had COVID bad around July 1st, for months had brain fog but thank God thats slowly disappeared. Can 4-5 weeks inside and inactive screw a person up THIS BAD????? I know I have to stay off my phone/TV and spend less time in bed. But I read about the initial side effects of Zoloft & Im delaying starting. Had a 30 of Dexilant & cant say I need that either.

Well, I say ""bothering"", but it was really just something that was kinda weird and interesting--when I close my eyes, I lose all sense of proportion in my body. My head feels huge or tiny compared to my hands, my feet will feel like twigs against my legs (or vice versa), etc. etc. For some reason it\'s taken me over a decade to realize that maybe, just maybe, it\'s not a normal thing that everyone feels, so I decided to look it up.\n\nI quickly landed on the wikipedia page for Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. At first I thought that really couldn\'t be it, because everything in the wiki was pointing to it being an aura for a migraine, which I have never had in my life. But then I saw that it was also an aura for some people who have epilepsy, and it clicked with something I had discussed with my therapist some months back. \n\nFor me, Lamictal has been something of a miracle drug. 200mg/day has kept me more stable than I could have possibly hoped for over the last year. When discussing the medication itself and the effects it\'s had on me, my therapist mentioned a theory she read about and had been discussing with some colleagues about why anticonvulsants like Lamictal and  Depakote can be so incredibly effective for so many people with bipolar disorder, which pretty much boiled down to ""it kinda does the same things to certain parts of your brain as a seizure, just slower and longer"". \n\nI did more research into it back then and found a few studies on the comorbidity of epilepsy and behavioral disorders, but not really anything specifically related to bipolar disorder and its relation to epilepsy aside from one article that I couldn\'t access because i\'m too poor to pay for it. Now learning that I have this other symptom that\'s more commonly associated with epilepsy than bipolar disorder, I guess it\'s just got me wondering how many others might be experiencing something similar.\n\nTL;DR: Sometimes my feet feel tiny because brain and it might be related to epilepsy and bipolar, does it happen to you too?'"

I had planned to take it for the first time today at 8am but it is now 11am and I am both equally as upset that I have not been able to take it as I have been pretty much freaking out over it for the last 2 hours.\n\nI think my biggest fear is of being ""high"", having weird body sensations and it also causing more anxiety. Also the fact that it\'s ""long acting"" scares me also becuase if I am having a bad time the bad time will be drawn out. Atleast if I am having a panic attack in my sober self they are kinda just made up in my brain right, so I can calm myself down where if a medication causes me to panic I can\'t just remove the medication from my body or stop it if it starts to freak me out. \n\nAlso a lot of the things I am terrified of (the covid vaccine was one, and the fact I have to get my wisdom teeth out is another) are things that I HAVE to do. Where seeing as this medication isn\'t something I HAVE to do (I\'ve been alive 29 years without right?) I am struggling to just force myself to take it. \n\nI have never taken any sort of mood disorder drugs before despite having depression since I was 15yo, anxiety my whole life but it was never a problem and never realized I had anxiety until I was about 21-23yo when I developed panic attack disorder after taking codeine (for a minor surgery I had, ended up in the ER dept thinking I was dying) as well as I had a bad trip on smoking green around 19-20 that I believe was the moment that panic attacks became a problem in my life.\n\nI largely choose therapy over medications for my mental health issue which I had great success with until covid happened as I have found it extremely hard to ""put my mask back on"" and return to ""normal life"" post covid. \n\nThis self exploration thorough out covid led to my ADHD diagnosis and subsequently the desire to try medication as I am struggling to maintain  being a member of society.  \n\nI know I am probably overthinking this massively. I over thought covid and didnt sleep at night from worrying about catching it, yet when I caught it, it sucked but I was fine.\n\nIt\'s hard to sometimes gauge how full on the side effects will be, like elevated heart rate, I can\'t find information on HOW elevated.\n\nWas anyone else this terrified and can offer some advice? \n\nOr can compare their experience to something I can quantify, like drinking coffee/energy drink?\n\n**TLDR:** First time taking any medication for anything brain/mood etc related. Extremely anxious over taking it. Need reassurance or a slap or something.'"

I didn't listen to the dealers advice and ended up having way more then I should have. It started off slow with little to know affect, so I kept having them, until it eventually hit me like a wall, and my heart started to race. I started to panic and tried to throw up, but it didn't help much. After that didn't work, I tried drinking a bunch of water, but my heart rate kept skyrocketing. Eventually I had someone drive me to the hospital, and my memory is kinda hazy after that. The hospital also said I had barbiturates in my system, but I believe that may be caused by the fact that I consumed kratom in the past. Surprisingly after this event I seemed fine, until the next time I had smoked. During this I convinced myself that I was having a heart attack and had a similar experience except without going to the hospital. I thought I was going to die. A few days later I had the same experience without smoking weed. After that I quit smoking weed, cigarettes, and, alcohol and caffeinated drinks. But, this didn't do much, but make the panic attacks worse and I started getting paranoid about my environment. For example I would have weird thought processes and was at a point where I was half convinced my mother was trying to poison me. \nDuring this month I also began to have massive amounts of heartburn and felt sick whenever I ate food. I believe this was caused by antibiotics I took for acne. It's been three months now and I had my heart checked by a cardiologist and the panic attacks have mostly gone away, but they are still triggered by certain things. Caffeine can cause it, I had a non-alcoholic beer and that caused me to start to panic. I want to be able to have a beer sometime in the future and maybe Coffee or iced tea, without having an adrenaline rush, from thinking my hearts about to fail.\n What should I do, I had no medical treatment for panic attacks earlier, because I was too young for the normal medication.

Im hurt and Im sad. I have been wronged so hard by my only parent. \n\nSo Some background info I am a domestic abuse survivor. I am 19. I was physically, emotionally, mentally, and verbally abused by my mother for the majority of my childhood. The physical abuse was severe. I was afraid for my life on a daily basis. My mother was my bully. The one thing I feared the most. Her wrath. It started when I was 6. And gradually got worse. First time I remember she put her hands on me o was 4. She pushed me to the ground. \n\nIt just got worse from there. If you can imagine it. She did it. I was thrown against walls, dragged around the house by my hair, punched, slapped, kicked in the face with shoes. Ive had all sorts  of objects thrown at me. Ive been beaten with objects. Remote control. Chair. My chromebook. Anything she had in her hand. Ive had my head slammed against the wall. She slammed me so hard I was bleeding out the mouth. Ive been chased with scissors. Laughing maniacally as she chased me around the house like she was going to stab me. Ive had my room destroyed countless times. And I was forced to clean the mess she made, forced to relive everything after finding the spoon she beat me with when I was cleaning up. Forced to do things for her. Piss in a pill bottle for her when I was 11-12 so she could fake her drug tests in rehab so she could keep using. Forced to hold the bottle of pee against the car heater. My arms were tired. If I moved even slightly I would get yelled at. Slapped. The passenger seat is full of horrible memories. Drove to school and back home 4 times because I couldnt answer her  mind game questions. Sent to school with a giant lump on my head from her striking me with her phone. \n\n I didnt deserve this. It went on for so long. I regret so many things. If only I had the courage to tell someone. I was so scared. Afraid of the consequences of speaking out. She told me not to tell anyone. I loved her so death even though she hurt me so many times and told me she didnt love me, she hated me, that Im worthless, she shouldve aborted me. Ive been told I would get sold and sent away to get raped. I was told I would get sent to live with my father, so I could get touched again. \n\nI am so angry. And sad. And empty. I want to hurt her how she hurt me. Its not fair that she committed horrific acts of violence against me when I was a minor, but if I show up at her house and started beating her face in, I get arrested. She should have been arrested. I should be allowed to inflict that pain onto her. With no repercussions. Just how she did to me. She doesnt deserve anything. She doesnt deserve to have a relationship with my little brother. I dont know whats wrong with me.  Why was I treated so badly but my little brother wasnt. Why was he spared? I do not wish what I went through upon him but it just doesnt feel fair. My mother gets to commit crimes and gets away with it. Why cant I get away with it too? I think about beating absolute shit out of my mother. I fantasize about killing her. I know I should just never speak to her again, which ive already blocked her months ago.\nBut I will just wish that I could have a relationship with my mother. They were good times, but this already added to the confusion that I felt. \n\nWhen I was 17, she sent me away to the psych ward. So she didnt have to deal with the problems that she caused. She was sick of me bringing up everything that she had done to me. She sent me back there two more times until she finally kicked me out. She kicked me out because she found a bottle of vodka under my bed but literally four days prior was giving me 4 100 proof nips. The day I got out of the psych ward. She was getting me drunk. Ever since I was 12, she was manipulating me with weed, alcohol, and pills. If I didnt do something for her, she would not give me weed. The first time I ever smoked weed was with my mother. She forced me to smoke with her. I did not want to do it first and she made me cry because the way she want me to smoke with her was very weird and traumatic. She took a hit, and forced me to come close. She blew the smoke into my mouth. It was gross. Thats how it started. I got addicted to her gabapentin 800mg. She gave me a taste one day. I would steal 20-30 pills at a time. On Easter of 2020, she gave me gabapentin in my Easter eggs. Like she was trying to raise an addict. Ive tried Xanax, Percocet. All because of her, I know how those feel. Not to mention what would happen if she found out I smoked/ got weed from anyone besides her.\n\nIm angry because I know its too late for me to do anything about it. When I was sent to the psych ward when I was 17, I told them everything. They still sent me back there when I was released. this system is trash. They dont care about you nobody. Nobody does. Not even your parent cares.  \n\nOne of the worst parts was when she was put at fault, later on in my life, she acted like she was the perfect mother. Manipulated everyone, my doctors, my school. She lied to the doctors when I was in 6th grade, said I needed ADHD medication. Adderall was what she requested. Why did they do it? The adderall wasnt really for me, she was selling it. But I still had to take it or else they would know. 30 mg of adderall, or a 10 year old? Why? Thats too much!! It made me anorexic, borderine made me go crazy. At 10 years old Im crying having a panic attack because my brain felt  so stimulated, I needed to do something. No matter what I did, colored, cleaned, anything it wasnt evough. It made me feel terrible. I eventually told the doctor what was happening. They stopped prescribing me the adderall and my mom was infuriated. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE FOR US WHEN YOU TOOK AWAY THE MONEY SUPPLY? I just didnt want to take a pill that made me feel horrible. \n\nAt this point, I dont even care if I go to prison for assault. I need my revenge. Cutting her off just isnt enough for me. I need her to feel the physical pain she put me through. Even though she broke her leg and six places and has an auto immune disease, which makes it so she cant heal, I still feel as though she hasnt suffered enough. Not Like Ive suffered. I want to see the fear in her eyes. Just like she saw the fear in my eyes. I want her to see herself in me as she gets beaten down with my full force of rage. I have so built up rage inside, I feel as though that I have the potential to kill with my bare hands. \n\nSometimes I wanna hurt myself again. Sometimes I wanna numb myself again. Ive come so far, but I constantly find myself reverting back. I am only partially healed. \nIt feels like the only way I can fully heal is if I beat her bloody.'"

Suffered, and worked out harder for about 6 weeks before seeing a doctor who Rx PT and nothing else. Failed PT (they told me to stop coming) and finally got imaging in Sept 2021 which showed L4/L5 disc problem causing pain. Did 2 steroid shots in October and November 2021, tried a chiropractor and more PT. Was miserable.\n\nJanuary 2022, saw a surgeon who recommended MD with laminectomy. I waited a few weeks so surgery would happen at end of my teaching term. The first surgery was on March 1, 2021, I felt a little better immediately after, but as soon as the steroid pack wore off, the pain was back and got WORSE. I was crying in agony and despair 2 - 4 weeks post-op. I called the surgeon's PA and did another MRI. when I went back for 6-week post-op, the surgeon said that a ligament had fallen into the space he created and he recommended another surgery ASAP. So 6 weeks after the first, on April 21, 2022, I had 2nd MD/laminectomy. Recovery went much better - until 6 weeks post-op when I suddenly had swelling at my incision site. The surgery team almost sent me stat to the OR but because of end-of-year craziness, I asked to watch and wait, and it did resolve but caused a MAJOR setback. Imaging showed swelling that started at the surgery site in the spine all the way to within a few millimeters of breaking through - so it ripped all the internal healing and I was back at square 1. It was miserable. In July and August I healed, worked through more pain, and started PT in September 2022. Things got progressively better but I did have a few setbacks - including right after I healed from COVID in December 2022 - I thought I was for sure back to the beginning, I was out of commission for a few days, but over the course of about 6 weeks, the pain got better. \n\nLingering pain led me to a new Physiatrist who is more holistic and led me to a pilates-based PT. I now do Pilates and walk almost every day. I've accepted I will likely always be 'high maintenance' and never back to some of my favorite activities (like mountain biking and white water rafting). I have a few more discs that are unstable, but I'm not in pain most days. Days I don't need any Advil feel like such a win and I've made it a week or more without needing pain relief - which is amazing. \n\nKeep trying new things when something doesn't work for you and keep the faith- it will get better."""
celebrex,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical_advice/comments/127rdg6/severe_hand_pain/,b'Severe hand pain',,"b"" \n\nI am a 52 yo woman who has OA. I was on Meloxicam, 7.5 mg twice a day, for several years and it seemed to be working just fine. I had to discontinue it because my ortho wanted me to take Advil for my shoulder for 5 days (and they cannot be combined.) When I restarted Meloxicam, it no longer worked. My rheum has prescribed (and I have tried them separately or with Gabapentin) Diclofenac, Nabumetone, Sulindac, Gabapentin and Celebrex (which worked about 25 years ago.) I was also taking 1000 mg Tylenol three times a day (in addition to the other meds.) None of these have brought me any relief. I have tried 2:1 gummies (I didn't enjoy feeling high) and 2000 mg tincture. Voltaren gel topically. Nothing has helped. I am in so much pain that my hands wake me up and it is getting harder and harder to function. Has anyone else had a similar situation and did you find something that helped? I am desperate.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas why the Meloxicam may have stopped working? Or what else I may be able to try. My Rheum said maybe I should try Piroxicam next but I am so discouraged at this point."""

It didnt hit us till later as we were about to buy more Benadryl. She got a call because the cops came to do a wellness check on her because she was sending everyone goodbye texts just in case we died. \nWe rushed home once the police were gone and then went to bed. Thats when we felt our hearts slowing along with our breathing. I had a lot of anxiety and every time I stood up I felt loopy and kinda floating like. I was washing my hands and thats when I heard my name being called but no one was there. I kept almost passing out but then Id get a shock of anxiety and I was wide awake. The entire night I kept waking up then going back to sleep. I had no energy to do anything except just keep my eyes shut and ride it out till I fell asleep. My roommate called me since she lives upstairs and told me she kept catching herself not breathing and that her own voice sounds weird like extremely loud. And I felt the same way. \nToday Im just very drowsy and been napping mostly. It almost felt like I was dying last night and it was interesting. I just feel numb at this point.

I would get severe insomnia and extreme fatigue at the same time. At first I'd fall into complete fatigue, extremely tired and exhausted. My muscles would continue to spasm and cause cramps. I'd lie in bed for days not getting up. Then days would follow of insomnia and not being able to sleep. After trying it the thoughts in my head got so much worse and constant. They became obsessive and more aggressive. I even had an episode of bad spasms. I could not possibly sit still or lie down yet I was so tired and struggled to keep moving. I was on an airplane and started going up and down the aircraft screaming I needed an ambulance. Since I was a minor and my guardian didn't authorise to get off the airplane I was stuck. That went on for a long period of time while they were fixing the aircraft. It even caused my jaw muscles to start moving and do weird things to my face. I ended up having to take 8 lorazepam pills to relax me. The effects continued to last for days after. Horrible experience, will literally make me pass out anywhere.

dexilant,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical_advice/comments/u4r40b/uknown_medical_mystery/,b'Uknown Medical Mystery',,"b"" \n\n**Shane Symptoms Report for Undiagnosed Issue**\n\n**Symptoms:**\n\nOn 12/25, I got a sickness (symptoms were sick feeling, sore throat, cough, and ill feeling) which only lasted a day. Coincidentally after this day, my facial Symptoms started on 12/26 and ended on 12/27 (I only had these symptoms at night) which consisted of a sore/tight masseter (towards the bottom of my right side masseter, lower right jawline and upper right neck) and slight/minimal twitching of this same region (my mouth was not twitching, rather my upper right neck/lower jaw line was involuntary twitching and voluntarily twitching in response to discomfort feeling), these symptoms went away coincidentally after I stopped taking metoclopramide(5mg once a day for about 5 days). My symptoms also coincidentally began when i was looking up the potential side effects of the medication. I am bringing this up as the stress (worrying, anxiety) i put on this part of my face might have started my flare up.\n\nI originally took metoclopramide (Reglan) (with the same dosage and method as described above) from August 4th to october 6th (9 weeks) and then I took a drug holiday (stopped taking the medication from October 3rd 2021 to -December 22nd where I began taking it again from 12/22-12/27 until I decided to stop taking it due to concerns over side effects the medication could cause and because I thought my mouth was getting sore due to the medication. I am still uncertain if the medication is responsible for these symptoms. I have not been on metoclopramide since december and the reason I bring this up is because I know that this medication has been known to cause nerve issues so the medication can be a variable to why I am having these issues\n\nA few days after my symptoms went away I got sick again which consisted of the same sick symptoms (sore throat and cough) plus brain fog for about a month in January (consisting of a sore throat, cough, and brain fog) (Covid-19 test was negative). I was sick from 1/1/2022 to around the third or fourth week of January. Once I recovered from my symptoms, my facial symptoms came back (facial symptoms started around third or fourth week of January)\n\nIn late January, my symptoms were:\n\nsore/tight masseter that would get more tight or sore when pressure is pushed against my masseter region for an extended period of time (such as if I lay on my masseter region, it will get tight or sore). Mostly right side of my face but sometimes left side to a less painful extent\n\nMy soreness would mostly be on the right side of my face, but sometimes the left\n\nMy soreness expands from the masseter, sometimes to my jaw, and to my upper neck region especially the upper right side of my neck\n\nSometimes, my upper right side of my neck/lower side of masseter feels like it wants me to spasm my face towards that direction to calm down my symptoms, I believe I am doing this voluntarily but sometimes I would have a tic in response to the pain (as seen in the video I will show)\n\nThese symptoms have lasted from late January to present day; however, around late february and early march, I have developed more symptoms which include:\n\nMinor non-painful muscle contractions where my muscle will pop in and out for a few seconds (sometimes it doesnt visibly pop in and out but it feels like it does and i can feel it vibrate). I have a video example of this happening in my leg that I will show.\n\nThese involuntary muscle contractions have happened within my thigh both legs, my calf both legs, my buttocks region, upper arm region, and sometimes upper right side of neck\n\nOther symptoms include a loose/fatigue/tired arm feeling that would sometimes happen with lower to upper arm area\n\nMy legs get tight or loose/fatigue/tired randomly, usually getting tight when more pressure is applied to muscles or when I am doing simple activities such as walking or standing for extended period of time. \n\nMy legs and arms sometimes feel fatigued and a loose type of feeling, despite this, my legs are capable of moving around normally and I am able to lift my legs up normally (as in my legs are not completely weak, or even weak in general perhaps)\n\nMy toes randomly have a tingly, tense feeling which is triggered more when I wear socks but sometimes happens when I am not wearing socks. I think my toes might be twitching slightly but I am unsure. \n\nI have been having mouth tension feelings where my mouth feels tense, despite this, my mouth have been completely in control, just a weird tingly feeling in general\n\nI have sometimes felt a popping sensation between my upper lip and my gums. I move my upper lip to make my mouth feel more comfortable when I experience these symptoms\n\nThe leg tightness and mouth tension have developed a bit more in the past few weeks. Recently my legs have been having slight pain but very minor pain. I have been having cramps through my thighs, calves, buttocks area of my body\n\nSometimes my symptoms are severe, sometimes they are not. My symptoms have been random and I have had them every day, but they are not always constant. \n\nSometimes I have a popping sensitive feeling between my upper lips and my gums and sometimes my mouth feels sensitive \n\n**Symptoms I am not having:**\n\nI am having no involuntary movements despite sometimes having my upper right neck/lower right masseter spasm sometimes voluntarily or involuntarily, I am in full control of my body especially my mouth, nose, eyes, ears, and eyelids \n\nI dont think I have Tardive Dyskinesia, I saw a UCI neurologist that tested me for TD (prior to me developing symptoms throughout my body) which declared that I do not have TD as I was on a low dose of Metoclopramide and the chances of me developing TD at my dosage was extremely rare. I also do not think i have any other extra pyramidal symptoms; however despite my primary and neurologist informing my that my symptoms are not from metoclopramide, i am still not 100% convinced and I think my symptoms could possibly be a long term side effect from this medication as metoclopramide does mess around with dopamine levels in the brain and is a blocker in the brain in general that can cause multiple problems\n\nMetoclopramide is known to also potentially cause akathisia and dystonia, both of which I dont think I am having symptoms of\n\nI do not think it is ALS as this happens mostly in older patients and starts asymmetrically on a foot or hand which is not how my symptoms started. (Hopefully it is not ALS). Also my symptoms did not start like bulbar ALS (my tongue and voice box are fine) \n\nI do not think it is fibromyalgia despite my symptoms being similar, as fibromyalgia mostly happens in women and is more severe \n\n**Possible Causes:**\n\nThe cause of my symptoms are not confirmed to be metoclopramide but my symptoms did develop when I was taking this medication; however I developed more symptoms even after I was off of the medication for months and my symptoms did not really last long term until 3-4 weeks after I had been off the medication (as I had no side effects for 3-4 weeks after i stopped the medication except for my sickness). I was also on a low 5mg metoclopramide dosage one pill a day. I could possibly have side effects from the medication but I am unsure. Metoclopramide could cause drug-induced parkinsonism and some of my symptoms resonate with this temporary disease; however, a lot of the other symptoms that this causes I am not having such as trembling or a shaking presence or drooling. My grandpa passed away due to Parkinson's so parkinsions might run in my family. I could also be having other long term side effects from the medication that are not anything specifically diagnosable or a type of dystonia that i am unaware of\n\nI am currently low on Vitamin D, my levels are at 17 (I will attach my blood results to this document)\n\nAround the same time I was taking this medication, I was excessively chewing gum for the past few months every day. My symptoms early on did sound like TMD jaw symptoms which my dentist, primary doctor, and an ears/nose/throat specialist thought I could have. I thought this at first; however, I began developing symptoms throughout my body so I am unsure if this could be TMD/TMJ issues. The three doctors I mentioned above I saw for these symptoms prior to my symptoms occurring throughout my body. My dentist and ears/nose/throat specialist noticed that my masseter region was tight when they were feeling/massaging this region. My primary doctor noticed that I did have a slight popping feeling when I open my mouth wide, and It has been originally a bit difficult to open my mouth wide, this however still does not explain why I have had symptoms throughout my body\n\nI have been in my house a lot and have not received a lot of sunlight. I have also not been getting a lot of exercise or doing a lot of activities lately\n\nI do deal with anxiety and minor depression issues, however, I am absolutely convinced that anxiety/depression are not the cause of my symptoms. They may be the reason my symptoms get worse at times when I am already having the symptoms, but I dont think they are the cause \n\nMy sickness i think could be a contributor towards my sickness as potentially my sickness caused my symptoms, specifically the brain fog?\n\nAnother coincidence around this time was how much i stressed this region of my body (mouth area neck area). I have had an anger issue where i bite the palm of my hand when i fail to accomplish something, cant find something, or i get angry about something which stresses the part of my face/neck that has been hurting. I have also purposely stressed this part of my face/neck in general as a reaction to stressing over something\n\nI also possibly noticed that when i have a stress episode/ bite my hand episode, it might correlate with when my symptoms get worse but i have no confirmation on this yet\n\n**Possible Causes/Medications I have been taking**\n\nI currently have G.E.R.D and have been taking PPIs since the summer to treat these symptoms. I have been on the same dosage (40mgs once a day). The PPIs I have been on are pantoprazole at one point, dexilant at one point, and for the past few months I have been taking omeprazole as my preferred PPI. Recently, I have also been taking Pepcid twice a day starting about a week/two weeks ago. The reason I originally took metoclopramide was to treat my G.E.R.D. \n\nI have been on a symbicort Budesonide 80 mcg inhaler (two puffs in the morning, two puffs at night) every day since october. I was originally on a 160 mcg version of this inhaler with the same amount of puffs (4 puffs in one day, 2 at night, 2 in morning) from mid august to mid october. \n\nDuring my sickness, I took azithromycin 250 mg tablets (2 tablets one day and then 1 tablet for four days) back in late january.\n\nI have been taking digestive enzymes and Zinlori 75\n\nI am taking Vitamin D pills and Vitamin K1 and K2 pills to combat my low vitamin levels\n\nI am taking wart removal medication for a wart at the bottom of my foot for over a year now (treatment done once a day). Verucide wart removal solution applied physically to the war at the bottom of my right foot. \n\nA few weeks ago, I was on cyclobenzaprine for a few days (3 tablets a day) (10mg). These symptoms caused me heartburn and for my G.E.R.D to come back which I have luckily been able to control thanks to Pepcid. \n\nSymptoms unrelated to my medications could be the cause such as a pinched nerve or some other neurological issue (hopefully not) \n\n**Doctors I have seen**\n\nI have seen a primary doctor a few times + a blood test, a dentist, a walk in clinic, multiple pharmacists, ears/nose/throat specialist, and a neurologist. I called my gastrologist and pulmonologist at one point. \n\nMy primary doctor does not think the metoclopramide is the cause of my symptoms and does not think I have TD; however, she does not know what I have and she referred me to see a neurologist for a second opinion\n\nMy neurologist tested me for TD and that is it, he was not that helpful in figuring out my symptoms; however, I saw him before symptoms spread throughout my body\n\nMy ears/nose/throat specialist and dentist thought I could have TMD or TMJ; however, I saw both of them before symptoms spread throughout my body. \n\nI recently saw my second neurologist which said it could be from anxiety or an undiagnosed issue, he said I could get an EMG/NCV test, MRI scan, see an endocrinologist, rheumatologist, and get a CK Muscle Enzyme Test. My neurologist thought that the medication (Metoclopramide) did NOT cause my symptoms but is unsure what is wrong with me, he thinks it is not a neurological issue rather an issue with my muscles. \n\n**Plan Going Forward**\n\nSee a Rheumatologist, Endocrinologist, get a CK Muscle Enzyme Test, Possibly an EMG and MRI test\n\nIf these methods do not give me an answer, possibly seek Mayo Clinical undiagnosed treatment. \n\n**Documents**\n\n**Blood Work**"""

Weight ~155 lbs (dont keep a scale at home so this is from my last appt in December.) height 5 ft 4. \n\nI have an upcoming appointment with a new rheumatologist to get a second opinion. The first rheumatologist I saw said I needed to see an orthopedic specialist for my recurring back/hip pain, starting about when I was 25-26ish. He told me come back if I have any rashes. \n\nMy primary joint pain so far has been all lumbar spine/hips. In the last week or two Ive also had wrist pain/stiffness which is totally abnormal for me.\n\nAdditional info:\n\n\tOther symptoms Im tracking include various skin problems (pernio/chilblains on toes practically year round; excessive dead skin on bottom of foot, tested at Derm and is not athletes foot - no improvement with steroid cream; perpetual red flushed cheeks/facial rash that is not raised but sometimes bumpy - and is not acne; history of seborrheic dermatitis on scalp as child); pelvic pain history (dx vaginismus in 2018); suspected Raynauds in fingers/toes; general lack of bodily temperature control (excessively hot or cold for no apparent reason, almost like hot flashes/cold flashes); memory problems and hard time retrieving words or finishing sentences sometimes; GI (occasional diharhea/nausea out of the blue. Heartburn that could be from Meloxicam, the first rheum prescribed me as daily NSAID). History of migraines from scent based triggers. Frequent headaches, multiple times a week sometimes and other times less frequent, that feel like my brain is just too big for my head. \n\n\tIve had blood work in 2021 (Dec.) ordered by my PCP and in 2022 (Jan.) ordered by first rheum which he used to dismiss an autoimmune diagnosis and recommended I see an orthopedic specialist. Im open to it but am worried that without knowing the cause of the joint pain undergoing any kind of surgery or more intensive procedure wont long term help without at least also understanding the underlying cause. I was on a high dose (40 mg I believe) long taper of prednisone from Nov. 2021 (went to the urgent care on Black Friday) to end of Dec. 2021.\n\n\tDec. 2021 bloodwork: Creatine Kinase low (24 / range 29-143); white blood cell count high (17.5 / range 3.8-10.8); hemoglobin high but barely (15.8 / range 11.7-15.5); hematocrit high (46.4 / range 35-45%); platelet count high (412 / range 140-400); absolute neutrophils high (15,295 / range 1500-7800).

I don't have any medical conditions or history of dental issues that would be pertinent to this situation.\n\n[Heres a link](https://imgur.com/a/xCOj8d8) to the Imgur gallery where I've posted pertinent pictures.\n\nI've had tooth pain for a few weeks. Bottom left, far back molar. Sensitivity when I drink cold water, eat too hot foods, and pain when I put pressure on the tooth. \n\nI went to the dentist a week ago and they didn't see anything wrong, told me to get some Sensodyne to reduce sensitivity. I did, and had no improvement over the week. About 3-4 days ago, I noticed some bumps forming in the same general area as the pained tooth. So yesterday I went to the dentist again to have them look at it. The dentist was stumped, and referred me to an oral surgeon to see if they could figure out the problem. \n\nThe oral surgeon can't see me until Monday, and I had bad enough pain this morning that I took two Advil and applied a lot of oragel, and I took to the internet to see if I could figure out what it was on my own. I'm not usually the type to self-diagnose, I know to trust medical professionals but man I was desperate, in a lot of pain. \n\nLong story short, my symptoms seemed to point to a partially erupted transverse lingual paramolar. It just made sense: I have bumps in a pattern that seems similar to the crown of a small molar, it feels like teething pain, I poked one of the bumps with very pointy tweezers and it felt like poking a tooth, and my teeth on the left side seem to have shifted forward in my mouth a bit, as my left canine is more crooked than the right, and it used to not be crooked. \n\nI know paramolars are rare, but I have a buccal conical paramolar on tooth # 15 (I think, I might have the wrong number. Very back top left molar). So with pain around and behind tooth # 18 (very back, bottom left), I wondered if it was just a vertical symmetry thing, I have a spare tooth on the top left so maybe I'd grow one on the bottom left too. According to a study I found on the management of supernumerary teeth, it is rare but possible to have a supplemental paramolar between the first and second maxillary molars. I had my wisdom teeth, my first maxillary molars, removed, so a paramolar behind my farthest back tooth would be between the second maxillary molar and the space where the first maxillary molar would have been, had it not been extracted. \n\nSo I went back to the dentist and requested a copy of my x-rays. The close-ups didn't go back that far, but the panoramic didn't show anything in the area where I'm having pain. I told the dentist my theory, so they agreed to take another xray as far back in my mouth as possible, just to see if there was anything there that didn't show on the panoramic for some reason. \n\nThat close up doesn't show anything behind my # 18 molar. So now I'm stumped, the dentist is stumped, and I have to wait all weekend before I can go to the oral surgeon to see if they have any idea what it could be. \n\nWhat could be hard like a tooth, feels like teething and pressure on my other teeth, but not show up on x-rays? \n\nI'm attaching a picture of my paramolar on the top tooth in case that matters, as well as pictures of the bumps in question (as good as I could get by shoving my iPhone in my mouth, sorry it's not ideal) and the x-rays. \n\nAt this point I'm probably stuck just using oragel all weekend and waiting to meet with the surgeon anyway, but I figured I'd ask Reddit just in case anybody could identify the problem, so I could at least bring a theory to the surgeon now that my paramolar theory was shot down. \n\nIf you read all this, thank you for your time. And whether you read all of it or not, I hope you have a good day!"""

anticonvulsant problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/v4o1m0/memory_loss_and_mental_health_medications/,b'Memory Loss and Mental Health Medications',,"b""Memory loss is a common topic within the mental health world. I'm an RN that works in Mental Health & going to do my best to summarize some research on *which* mental health medications impact our memory and *why* they do.\n\n**Memory** refers to the mechanisms that are used to collect, accumulate, preserve, and later retrieve information. There are three actions involved in **'memory'**: processing, storing, and recalling.\n\n## I will Include the link to the original post that is probably easier to follow but also going to include all the info below.\n\n[https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/](https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs\n\n**citalopram, celexa, escitalopram, lexapro, fluoxetine, prozac, sarafem, symbyax, fluvoxamine, luvox, luvox CR, paroxetine, paxil, paxil CR, pexeva, sertraline, zoloft, vilazodone, viibryd**\n\n### Drug class\n\nThis is a very common drug class; prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, migraines, panic attacks, eating disorders, PTSD, OCD, and even chronic pain. Over 10% of the US takes an SSRI.\n\n### What Do SSRIs Do?\n\nWhat does every medication within this class have in common? They all increase the level of Serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. When you take a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, youre blocking the neurons from reabsorbing Serotonin, meaning there is more Serotonin available.\n\nSo what does Serotonin do? Well, A LOT. Serotonin influences our mood and emotional state, our digestion, appetite, our sleep cycle. It is found in your brain, in your intestines and even in your blood. One could argue that it impacts everything.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nSerotonin is even in animals, plants and fungus. While we can measure the levels in our blood we cannot measure the levels within our brain. Meaning were all in the dark as to how much is within our brain and whether or not its even correlated to the amount in our blood.\n\nHow SSRIs Impact Memory\n\nAge and gender do not seem to influence the data that SSRIs are correlated with memory effects. Something that is important to mention, is that while research has shown that SSRIs are *correlated* with memory loss, that doesnt exactly mean that they CAUSE it. Correlation and cause are two different things. Many people that take SSRIs also take benzodiazepines, drink, smoke, have genetic predisposition to memory loss, etc. Depression and anxiety themselves can even cause memory problems.\n\nSummary\n\nSo, after reading through many articles, there overall wasnt enough credible information to emphatically say that an SSRI causes memory loss. In fact, I came across more research that suggested SSRIs improve cognitive performance and memory. Some data also specifically supported that SSRIs can improve memory for patients experiencing psychosis and depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Tricyclic Antidepressant | TCAs\n\n**anafranil, clomipramine, asendin, amoxapine, elavil, amitriptyline, norpramin, desipramine, pamelor, nortriptyline, sinequan, doxepin, surmontil, trimipramine, tofranil, imipramine, vivactil, protiptyline**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThe word tricyclic refers to the three molecular ring shapes associated with this drug class. These existed before SSRIs, but they seem to cause more side effects. This has led to SSRIs being more commonly prescribed nowadays. TCAs are still often administered for things like anxiety, depression, migraines, panic disorder, eating disorders, mood disorders, insomnia, hormone disorders, bedwetting, and even nerve pain.\n\nWhat do Tricyclic Antidepressants Do?\n\nWhat do all TCAs have in common? Similar to an SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants impact neurotransmitters. But, in addition to serotonin, they also block the reabsorption of norepinephrine. They ALSO block acetylcholine receptors. These key differences create a cascade of effects in the body that do impact memory. These key differences are also the culprit for the common side effects in this drug class like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nIn 1945, the Sulphur bridge of the phenothiazine ring of promethazine was altered to synthesize G22355 ( a weak antihistamine and mild anticholinergic with sedative properties). The new 'invention' was tested as an antipsychotic. It was ineffective for schizophrenia, but did have antidepressant properties. Thus, the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) was discovered.\n\nHow TCAs Impact Memory\n\nThere are multiple reasons why a TCA impacts our memory. **The first reason** is that we retain memory best when norepinephrine is released at an optimal rate. These drugs block the reabsorption of norepinephrine; which is known to be a moderator of memory. With too much of it, we are anxious and stressed, too little of it and we are drowsy and not as coherent. Either way, the drug has an impact on norepinephrine which directly influences how we store memory.\n\n**The second reason** why this drug class impacts memory is because it competes with our natural antagonists on muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors. It is well documented that these drugs block muscarinic receptors (which is an acetylcholine receptor), and acetylcholine directly impacts learning and memory.\n\n>*Muscarinic*acetylcholine*receptors* in the hippocampus and cortex underlie*memory*formation\n\nSummary\n\nSo, TCAs are a drug that research has linked with memory impairments and dementia. These drugs interfere with our bodies baseline of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. As with any drug; sometimes they create an optimal effect on a person, as for others, not so much. If a person is too excitable and anxious, a TCA can improve their quality of life (even could improve memory if their extreme anxiety was impairing it), while for another it can make them drowsy and leave a bad impression.\n\n\\*Note each drug within the class impacts the degree of these effects a little differently.\n\nIf youre feeling like doing a deep dive into some of the articles I read to gain clarity, by all means, click the links below!\n\n[Differential Cognitive Actions of Norepinephrine 2 and 1 Receptor Signaling in the Prefrontal Cortex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4876052/)\n\n[The effect of tricyclic antidepressants on cholinergic responses of single cortical neurones.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1666268/?page=7)\n\n[A brief history of antidepressant drug development: from tricyclics to beyond ketamine](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/acta-neuropsychiatrica/article/brief-history-of-antidepressant-drug-development-from-tricyclics-to-beyond-ketamine/B5C9D55C6299BC41B237187DB609DB68)\n\n## \n\n## Benzodiazepines\n\n**alprazolam, xanax, chlordiazepoxide, librium, clonazepam, klonopin, clorazepate, tranxene, diazepam, valium, lorazepam, ativan, oxazepam, serax, temazepam, restoril, triazolam, halcion**\n\nDrug Class\n\nThese are commonly considered anti-anxiety medication (though can be used for seizures, insomnia, and muscle spasms). They work by quickly slowing down important parts of our brain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets taco bout it.\n\nThis drug class specifically targets the GABA-A receptor, enhancing its effect, which slows down our central nervous system; this makes us feel relaxed, because the drug has retarted a major gear in our system (sometimes this is EXACTLY what we need).\n\nDid You Know?\n\nAnesthesiologists often give Versed (a benzodiazepine) so patients will not remember surgery?\n\nHow Benzodiazepines Impact Memory\n\nThis drug class changes our mental state & while the drug is advantageously quick acting, the effects linger. Short-term memory is not as affected, but long-term memory is specifically impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory and thus not consolidated into memory storage. The effects are similar to the long-term effects of alcoholism (alcohol is also a CNS depressant). Both of these substances, used long term actually damage our brain.\n\nThis is why a rehab center isnt going to allow the use of 'said drug' while recovering. This is why therapists often (but not always) stray away from patients taking 'said drug' while trying to work on trauma, recovery, etc. If the brain is not functioning & you're not able to remember anything, how can you work on it? The most effective aspects of benzodiazepines are precisely why individuals have a tendency to become dependent on them.\n\nNow, don't shoot the messenger. Obviously, there is a time and a place for benzodiazepines. They're an actual life saver for the (hopefully) occasional panic attack. But how sadistic is that Benzodiazepines have addictive properties, which means that with *repeated* use we will need *increasingly* higher doses, making the dent in your memory more and more indisputable.\n\nFull Disclosure\n\nMy mother was an addict, benzodiazepines being her drug of choice.\n\nDo you know an addict whose drug of choice is a benzodiazepine? No SHAME, but if so, you can probably attest that **they dont remember shit.**\n\nHow about an addict whose drug of choice is alcohol? All love here, but you can say for certain, *they dont remember shit*.\n\nThere has even been a fair amount of data to support that the risk of Alzheimers is elevated in those taking the drug for over 6 months. One Harvard study even speculated that it would raise the risk by 84%! Seems unrealistic, but who am I to question Harvard; I'll add the link below if you're also feeling speculative.\n\nAnother point of concern is that this drug will inhibit your brain from initiating activity of GABA A (since the medication has so kindly been doing it). What this means is that after the drug is long gone from your system, your brain experiences a lag in restoring the normal GABA balance.\n\nThis is often what is referred to as *rebound anxiety* because your anxiety is likely to get worse, before it gets better after taking a benzodiazepine, especially if taken long term.\n\nTake it from a nurse who works in mental health; it's not enjoyable being the bystander of a patient trying to escape their benzo addiction.\n\nBut this is why the mental health world is increasingly trying to move towards low dosing and only prescribing for a limited amount of time.\n\nNow, Benzodiazepines are very dangerous to quit cold turkey, so please dont go flush yours down the toilet after reading this.\n\nWhen Benzodiazepines were first discovered they offered an immediate solution to the overwhelming crippling anxiety that many people face, but the harsh reality is that were now in a benzo addiction crisis. Were learning over time, as a society and those changes dont happen overnight. And trust me, as a mental health professional I myself occasionally grow infuriated at the amount of family doctors who prescribe copious amounts of benzodiazepines only to later turn the patient away after addiction has crippled them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Harvard Article Claims Benzodiazepine use may raise risk of Alzheimers disease](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/benzodiazepine-use-may-raise-risk-alzheimers-disease-201409107397#:~:text=People%20who%20had%20taken%20a%20benzodiazepine%20for%20three,84%25.%20The%20type%20of%20drug%20taken%20also%20mattered.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Right now Im having amnesia and dj vu at the same time.

This drug class actually encompasses three different major classes\n\n1. Blocking Sodium Channels\n2. Enhancement of GABA Inhibition\n3. Regulation of Synaptic Releases\n\nWhy it Impacts Memory\n\nOverall, anticonvulsants work in different ways; trust me I rode the magic school for HOURS trying to gain an understanding of them to write this. Truthfully, we still have a lot to learn about them. Their impact is complicated and the effects range based on the dose and drug.\n\nFor instance, Topamax has pretty diverse pharmacologic actions, because of that, it **has** been linked with impaired concentration, cognitive dulling, psychomotor retardation, language and comprehension difficulties, rather extreme effects on short-term memory and working memory, poor verbal fluency and word-finding, reduced IQ scores, abnormal thinking and delayed cognitive speed. Because of this dark cloud of side effects, Topamax is sometimes referred to as 'Dope-A-Max'.\n\nHowever, a more selective medication within the drug class such as Phenytoin or Tegretol are more specific to blocking sodium channels. Overall, they seem to have less impact on memory and cognitive function.\n\nMany of these drugs listed above have an impact on GABA, and long term exposure to GABA agents can alter the functionality of GABA permanently, which means there are potentially permanent consequences to cognition, behaviors, and memory.\n\nPhenobarbital has been linked to lower IQ, and worse effects than Depakote and Tegretol, however it is actually a barbituate. Its effects are similar to benzodiazepines which you can read more about above.\n\nGabapentin, used for seizures and often mood disorders, belongs to it's own drug class. Still, it **has** been linked to memory impairment. Hence, the name, it also impacts GABA, which as mentioned several times now, certainly plays a hand in our ability to remember. At this point there isnt enough research to say its linked to dementia though.\n\nAs far as drugs for epilepsy, Gabapentin is tolerated much better than many others. Its also worth mentioning that this drug seems to have more *short term* effects on memory. Some will experience a disorienting feeling or short term memory loss while taking Gabapentin, but the reports of long term memory being impacted are reported less often.\n\n[Long Term Effects of Gabapentin](https://deserthopetreatment.com/sedatives/gabapentin-addiction/long-term-side-effects/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Antipsychotics\n\n**sometimes referred to as major tranquilizers or neuroleptics; risperidone, risperdal, quetiapine, seroquel, olanzapine, zyprexa, ziprasidone, zeldox, paliperidone, invega, aripiprazole, abilify, clozapine, clozaril, fluphenazine**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used as the first line treatment for schizophrenia & sometimes used for mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, Tourette's syndrome & Huntington's disease\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nMost drugs in this class work to block Dopamine, though some do impact other chemicals in the brain.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nOddly enough, memory seems to actually be improved when using an antipsychotic for a person with psychotic symptoms, though there are many that take medications within this class that are not psychotic. So let's talk about that more.\n\nWhy It Impacts Memory\n\nFirst, let's skip back to the purpose of these drugs. Schizophrenia is the **major** psychotic disorder we use antipsychotics for. Some of the main symptoms are delusions, lack of motivation, unusual behaviors, and hallucinations. Dopamine has been thought to regulate our brains understanding of our surroundings and what it all means to us. So, it's to be expected that drugs within this class target Dopamine.\n\nThis class is broken up into two categories;\n\n**First Generation (old, typical):** Block Dopamine-2 Receptors, which means they also block acetylcholine, histamine and norepinephrine. which do impact the complex way in which we store memories. \\*More movement disorders come with the old ones.\n\n**Second Generation: (new, atypical):** Block Serotonin and Dopamine Receptors**.** Less risk of extra movements, increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and weight gain.\n\nWhat do they all have in common? **They impact Dopamine.** Long story short; A delicate balance of Dopamine is needed for memory to function. Since this class targets Dopamine, it's fair to say it has the potential to alter our memory. Whether that's a good or bad thing is specific to the patient, but it's typically an unwelcome effect.\n\n# \n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Antihistamines\n\n**brompheniramine, dimetane, benadryl, diphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clistin, clemastine, tavist, doxylamine, unisom, hydroxyzine, atarax, vistaril, promethazine, phenergan, triprolidine, triafed**\n\nDrug Class\n\nCommonly used for allergies but also used for anxiety. Antihistamines are divided into different 'generations' & target different histamine receptors in our body.\n\n* H1 Receptors: Found Throughout the Body\n* H2 Receptors: Mostly Stomach Acid Secretion\n* H3 Receptors: Central Nervous System\n* H4 Receptors: Still Being Researched\n\nWhat Do They Do?\n\nWe're actually still learning a lot about histamines but what we do know is that **anti-**histamines are usually anticholinergic; **blocking** receptors for choline. The problem is that we need choline to be readily available to have the ability to learn, understand and remember.\n\n### Why it Impacts Memory?\n\nBeing that antihistamines are often anticholinergic, they do impair our ability to think, learn and remember. Especially the first generation antihistamines that easily penetrate our brain. We already naturally produce less acetylcholine overtime. This is partly why as we age our ability to remember, think, and learn diminishes. It's widely known that anticholinergics impact memory, thinking, learning, and muscle function. It is also suggested that these drugs increase the risk of developing dementia.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe only drug within this class that can be given intravenously is Benadryl. Since Benadryl is a first generation, it impacts our body in many ways in addition to the reason why it's administered. Since first generation antihistamines are much less specific in their effects, they are affiliated with greater memory impairment. Though, being the only IV antihistamine available, it is still widely used in hospital settings.\n\n### Summary\n\nOverall, the effects range. Regarding mental health specifically; Vistaril, hydroxyzine and Atarax are commonly prescribed for anxiety. While your risks are much less severe than benzodiazepines, these are FIRST generation antihistamines. Therefore, they do have a sedating effect (precisely why they can relieve tension) but this is also means they do impair our ability to remember.\n\nAn example of second generation antihistamines are Claritin & Zyrtec. Unlike first generation antihistamines, these do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. Therefore, they relieve many effects of allergies, but do not have as many sedating properties or memory impairments associated with them. When it comes to anxiety though, Claritin & Zyrtec won't do you much good.\n\nHope this helps clarify some of the impacts of memory and mental health medications. Leave a comment if there is a drug you're still wondering about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is the link again for original post below. \n\n[https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/](https://twoforsue.com/our-memory-is-threatened-by-these-6/)"""

ambien,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/c4myd1/sensitive_crown/,b'Sensitive crown?',,"b""So when I was a kid (around 12) until about two years ago (26) I had severe acid reflux due to a hiatal hernia that decalcified most of my teeth; my back teeth especially. Needless to say my molars top, bottom, left and right side are either crowns, root canals without a crown, or mostly filling.I had a tooth that was mostly fillings and last year my dentist said that there was not enough real estate on the surface of the tooth because the area around the fillings kept decaying and there was decay under one of the fillings so he just shaved the tooth and put a crown on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other day I said screw it and without insurance, I went to the dentist and paid $267 to get a cleaning and some x-rays done. I found out a few of my decalcified soft spots had turned to cavities of which neither of us were surprised. I mentioned to him that I have slight pressure sensitivity and severe cold sensitivity. Like brushing my teeth doesn't hurt but I take Ambien to sleep and when I take that whatever liquid I use hurts. It doesn't stay long it just feels like something cold going over a moderate cavity or chipped tooth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe used a tool to press against the crown and it didn't hurt and he said he did not see any signs of a crack and that I did have a cavity on the tooth next to the crown which he believed to be the culprit. Afterward, I got my treatment plan and the realization that I was going need dental insurance to get it all done because the treatment plan with the deep cleaning I needed and the cavities I needed filled was going to cost about $1900 without it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward a few days. It just kept irking me that I was so sure it was my crown that was the issue because I find it hard to believe that a small cavity on the buckle of tooth 29 could be causing pressure sensitivity or that it was causing pain that far back in my mouth. Like the pain feels like it's around tooth 31 but I know it isn't 31 as that is a root canal crown and I have never experience and sense of feeling from that crown in the four years that I have had it.\n\nSo tonight I went to go brush my teeth because there was a line on the top of the tooth that I mentioned to my dentist and he still said he didn't think it was cracked so I just wanted to see if it had gotten any worse. It looked the same but I pressed on the crown and it hurt. It's not immense pain but it's annoying, like imagine every time you take a bite of food someone presses on a sensitive bruise you have. Then I decided to let my finger sit under cold water and I then touched the back of the tooth making sure I stayed away from 29 so I knew it wasn't the cavity and sure enough that hurt as well. The cold sensitivity is much worse than the pressure sensitivity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith my dentist being wrong about the pain from the crown being from a cavity on the adjacent tooth could he be wrong about it not being cracked? Could the tooth underneath be damaged? With it having cold sensitivity does that mean a bite adjustment isn't the solution (if that is even possible this late into the game). I am just waiting on having the money to pay for insurance. Going with Delta Dental Clear as with not having to wait 6 months for services this is probably the best plan I can get even though its a flat $60-$90 copays on cleanings and fillings for $35/m.\n\nBut while I am waiting I just wanted to get the opinions of some other industry professionals and an idea of some things to discuss with my dentist when I go in to start my treatment plan. My hope is to either have insurance starting in July or August at the latest and I want to have my entire treatment plan completed before I leave to go to JMU at the end of December - beginning of January.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't think I can Tl;Dr this as a lot of the info is pertinent so what do y'all think? What suggestions do y'all have? What should I bring up with my dentist? Should I go for a second opinion if I walk away from my current dentist with the same condition? Any suggestions to lower the cold sensitivity in the mean time?"""

However despite it being normal my symptoms persist which is why I wanted to check the rest of my Hormones like my Thyroid, Prolactin, Cortisol, Estradiol, etc.\n\nAll of these symptoms began a couple of years ago after a period of chronic stress, depression, and worry.

I started wearing it again 2 months ago, now Im in near constant pain and hot and cold sensitivity. Is this normal?'",,"b'Hi there - hope this post finds you well. \n\nTLDR; I had a crown put on my left buckle molar on March 16th. I went 3 months without wearing my night guard. Once the crown got sanded down, I started wearing it again about 2 months ago but now Im at the point where most nights I have to take 1200mg of acetaminophen to make the pain go away. Is this normal? \n\nI have 4 drinks/wk. non smoker. \n\nFull story:\n\nI noticed a few days after the crown was put in that my night guard no longer fit and my bite was off. I was bummed about the night guard not fitting because I grind my teeth at night. Not wearing it led to sensitivity and a sore jaw. But life got in the way and I wasnt able to make a follow up appointment till July 14th. \n\n\nOn July 14th, my dentist sanded down the crown and my bite started feeling better. I got my night guard from a different office so my dentist didnt know what kind I had. I scheduled another visit for July 28th. The visit was quick as he confirmed I could change the shape by running it under hot water. \n\n\nHe advised that Id feel some soreness for the first month because the night guard was going to move my teeth back to their original position (pre-crown). Well, pretty fast I had heat/cold sensitivity. It was painfully sensitive. That was my only symptom for the first month. Now the sensitivity is constant but the intensity tends to be less. I just try not to aggravate it throughout the day.  Sometimes pain radiates from it at night, or from the tooth in front of it, under it, and sometimes opposite it (right rear molar). The pain is getting hard to ignore at night and doesnt go away unless I take 1200mg of acetaminophen. But my jaw isnt sore anymore so, yay?\n\n\nIm avoiding going back to my dentist office because theyre going to charge me another $20 for an exam. And I feel this is mostly my fault for not wearing my night guard and delaying my appointments. Ive never had braces so I dont know if this is the same pain as teeth moving. \n\n\nTime recap:\n\n\n- Pre-March 16th: in love with my night guard, no problems \n\n\n\n- March 16th: crown put in\n\n\n- March 17: stopped using night guard bc no longer fit \n\n\n- July 14th: crown sanded down \n\n\n- July 28th: started using night guard again\n\n\n- July 29th: pain started\n\n\n- Sept. 15th: have to take 1200mg at night, every other night \n\n\nThank you for any insight!!'"

and i should be so happy, i have a girlfriend who i fuckin love and everything is great and i have so many friends but i just hate myself and dont know how to deal with it. at least on adderall now it just feels bittersweet and i understand the sadness is what adds depth to my view of the world, without these intense chemical imbalances where the world is a dark, evil place, i would never be able to respect the indescribable beauty in the mundane.\n\nanyways, also im male and 16 if those details mean anything to the story. i prefer newports but smoking is fucking gross and i recommend nobody ever start. its just a problem ive been working on quitting. put lemon or lime juice in vodka and slam it to just get drunk with not too much of the gross taste. merlot is fucking awful. i dont play video games but earthbound and mother 3 are both indescribably beautiful. ive started prozac. im also on lithium and seroquel. i took a lot of seroquel a while ago and it felt a bit like my brain was melting but in a okay way. i didnt die. beer is gross and doesnt get you drunk fast enough. i only drink to get drunk. i hope someday to experience delirium tremens. ive attempted to drink a ton of days in row before to do it but i didnt get anywhere. adderall is great but please nobody go down the path of drugs. especially opiates. no adderall either. weed is overrated and fuck stoners, its a stupid personality crutch for people who are boring and want to make up for it in marijuana. i love you meredith. i am not wearing a shirt and i am in 7/11 and im wearing jorts but jorts are pretty stupid but its okay. this is more of a diary now. i love synthesizers and really want to buy a roland juno-60. i can link my soundcloud if anyone is interested in hearing weird 80s synthpop made with all genuine analog equipment and no DAWs. ok thanks. bye everyone. i love you all and understand what youre going through because i am too and i just want everybody to be strong.\n\nquick edit: i also have borderline personality disorder, which really adds to the intensity of the mood swings and the instability of my self image. im sure it also is what leads to my propensity to both experiment with drugs and also become dependent on them. i also worry about how easily i become attached to people and how i possibly feel emotions (such as love) to a degree few others mirror, so i will struggle eternally to feel like i have a truly mutual and balanced connection with nearly anyone. plus sometimes i just instantly lose feelings for people when they start to have feelings for me, which just further complicates my worries for how long i can sustain living within this personality i put up to other people to hide how troubled i am underneath. also im not wearing a shirt but i didnt get kicked out of the 7/11 for it so i guess thats pretty cool. its free slushie day so why not take advantage of that. i love thrift shopping because they have awesome 80s clothes and i have a deep genuine love for the 80s due to me growing up with a ton of my parents belongings from when they were near my age (including my dads david bowie vinyl collection!) so its deeply influenced my main interests and my music tastes. (i love new order, omd, george clanton, oneohtrix point never, percival pembroke, sales, bulldog eyes, alex g, arthur shea, software, esprit, satin sheets, and ill add more in a bit). also i have a deep love for psychology and have done a insane amount of studying into topics such as attachment theory, freuds theories, the past of psychology (and textbooks from the 60s), and schizophrenia (as more of a case subject of psychosis and that spectrum of mental illness instead of just the illness on its own). also i dont want to come off as a pseudo-intellectual, i used some big words in this but its just because no other words appeared in my mind that fit as well and i probably misused them all anyways. i used to be pretty smart in elementary school (lol) but then mental illness backhanded me in middle school and ive been a shitty unmotivated student since. maybe if i can maintain the motivation i have right now ill be able to manage. oh well.\n\nalso i know im young and its very easy to dismiss this all because itll all okay in time but really in the deepest depths of depression none of that means shit and id like to find a way to deal with this so ill be alive to see that point in the future. i understand everything ive said is stupid and reading it must come off as a pathetic mess of words and i feel the same but maybe somebody might feel a lil spice of empathy by reading this and thats all i really need. ill make it through all of this, i think.\n\nokay im done with the edit now\n\nquick second edit: i took 2 more adderall and bought a pair of pink sweatpants at goodwill because why not. they were way overpriced. also, super important music: i fucking love hiroshi yoshimura beyond articulation. he means so much to me. i got the vinyl represses from music for nine post cards and pier and loft which were quite expensive but who cares because theyre beautiful and i cried like a little bitch for both first listens. also listen to his album flora 1987 and green, the title track from green is indescribable. please listen to him for me kay? thanks.\n\ngoodbye for now.'"

Advil swelling,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/9foada/my_experience_with_vyvanse_also_my_suspicions_on/,b'My Experience with Vyvanse | Also My Suspicions on it Making Me Sick',,"b""Hey y'all.\n\nMy name's Cameron, I've just turned eighteen two months ago, and I've recently been diagnosed with ADD. Six months ago, I used Vyvanse without a prescription for at least a month. I'm 6'3, a 150-155 lbs (I fluctuate in weight a lot, for some reason), I have very mild psoriasis, and am on Stelara (a monoclonal cell therapy).\nDISCLAIMER: DO NOT SELF MEDICATE WITH PRESCRIPTION ADHD/ADD STIMULANTS AND NON-STIMULANTS.\nDO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ADHD/ADD STIMULANTS AND NON-STIMULANTS.\n\nI will give you the TLDR first.\n\n\nAt prom, I had little sleep, and took 40 mg of Vyvanse. I had been self-medicating myself for about a month. It's a hot day, and I'm sweating a bit, and feeling the heat. I drink a moderate amount of alcohol, and at prom pictures my vision is blurry, my skin becomes pale, slightly yellow, and I have to sit down and drink water in the shade -- only to get a fever late in the night (I had no thermometer with me at prom). I think I'm catching a flu, since I get chills before I feel sick, plus I had my Stelara injection the day before (and immunomodulator/suppressant).\n\n\n\nHow I Felt on Vyvanse (An Aside): I was interested in things that I had previously no interest in, I was keen to learn, and my mood was great. I had cold sweats, anxiety that came in waves, a low appetite, euphoria (for about 2-4 hours), I would get so caught up in work that I didn't realize a whole day had passed by while I was studying, and sometimes, I would get very frustrated with people very fast, causing outburst of yelling, or mean exchanges.\n\n\n\nBack to prom  The next day, I wake up drenched in sweat (to the point of changing my sheets -- no temperature though) only to get a temperature later in the day, of 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit). It goes away with Advil -- but other than the stuffy feeling in my ears and head, I feel very normal. The following days I have light fatigue and my doctor thinks I have mono. Blood tests and ultrasounds, along with a chest x-ray tell me I'm fine. Except, my first blood test which I had taken three days after my episode revealed very low platelet counts. They bounced back in a week, doubling in amount of what they were with the original test.\n\n\n\nFast forward to me being prescribed Concerta on August 2nd. I get anxiety, tingling hands, and chest, throbbing heart, and a general malicious and bad attitude. My focus was great, my memory the same. The first time I tried Vyvanse illegally my focus was insane, and I felt I could remember everything. However, my memory had begun to worsen at the end of my illegal self medication. On Vyvanse I had anger outbursts, but I was still empathetic, unlike Concerta, where I remained cool, but said some nasty stuff to people I love. My last week of Concerta, I was on 54 mg, but I felt it less than I did during the week of 32 mg, and the week before that with 18 mg. \n\n\n\nMy psychiatrist told me the anxiety had manifested into fatigue. A way of my body trying to get me to stop torturing it with stimulants. She prescribed me Vyvanse instead. 20 mg the first few days, then 40 the rest. The first few days I felt a little more awake, but it definitely was nothing like the first time I did it. And even nothing like the last few times. The first day of school comes around and I get no sleep because I'm nervous for school. Not a single hour. I wake up dead tired, and take a 40 mg vyvanse to wake me up. An hour in, as it sets in, my eyes become burning with tired, and I feel a certain weight in my forehead. I could fall asleep if I wasn't afraid of the repercussions in class. \n\n\n\nMy lymph nodes re-swell to the size they were during my episode in June, and my abdomen and stomach become bloated. The last three days I have felt pangs of pain, although not sharp, in my upper right abdomen, fullness in my upper left, and slight pangs in my bottom left. Nothing in the center, or the stomach, though. As my Vyvanse wears off, my lymph nodes shrink some, and if I don't take vyvanse for two days, they are back to a relatively small size, though, still larger than they were before I had ever even taken Vyvanse, when I didn't feel them at all.\n\n\n\nEverytime I take Vyvanse, the fatigue sets in as soon as Vyvanse is supposed to set in. I have zero focus, and I feel like my ADD is worse. Not to mention, my short term memory is as if I've eaten a pot edible. I forget things a few seconds after thinking about them. Emotion wise, I don't have anxiety, my insomnia isn't bad, but it's slightly there despite me being so tired. I also don't feel much urgency. My sex drive is nearly gone. I also don't feel depressed. I don't think as negatively as I did during this summer on the drug holiday, and I don't think nearly as deeply.\n\n\n\nIs Vyvanse making me tired, and compromising my immune system? Is Vyvanse making me sick? Conversely, am I sick, thus making Vyvanse ineffective? Every blood test I've taken says I'm not fighting an infection, at least not viral, and I've had the flu before, twice, while I was on methotrexate for my psoriasis and my lymph nodes didn't appear. Even worse, I wasn't even close to this tired with the flu. Do y'all recommend a medication I should ask my psychiatrist about? I'm seeing her on the 28th, but I'm calling her tomorrow to see if I can see her earlier.  Sorry for my tldr being long, but, I have to be thorough if I want accurate answers, and I need to be thorough in case someone is looking for someone to relate to. I want to know that if anyone is having my problems, that at least they aren't the only ones.\n\n\n\nTHE EVEN MORE DRAWN OUT EXPLAINATION (very detailed):\nhttps://pastebin.com/NNCpUJi9\n"""
benadryl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/148u9cq/accutane_anomaly/,b'Accutane Anomaly?',,"b'Posting this to hopefully be an informative source for anyone going through something similar. \nI started taking Accutane in February of 2023 for persistent cystic acne. \n\nI started out at 20 mg 2x daily, second month @30/2x daily, third month 40/2x daily.\n\nThe month that I was bumped up to my maximum dosage I was diagnosed with strep throat. Annoying, but I was treated. I expected my symptoms to diminish, but at the end of my course of treatment, my sore throat remained. \n\nI took as many measures as I fiscally could manage to attempt to get better. I\'ve literally consumed over a dozen pounds of honey this year, have drank ungodly amounts of chamomile/mint tea, salt water gargles... \nI went to urgent care literally over a dozen times trying to figure out what was happening. \n\nI even was misdiagnosed by an RN who told me I had an active STI. When going to get it treated they refused to treat me, as there was no such active infection. Amidst this process I reached out to someone I recently had sex with, and entirely burned a bridge to a new friend, lover, etc...\n\nAfter this appointment two employees at the health department suggested it could be a medication I\'ve been taking causing these effects?\n\nI called my dermatologist and they made me feel like I was crazy because ""no one else has reported these effects"" and they told me temporary cessation of accutane could significantly increase the length of duration of my total treatment \n\nI stopped taking Accutane about a week ago, and finally my sore throat symptoms flared up at first. What was only a sore throat turned into a sore throat, sneezing, coughing, and lots of congestion/expelling congestion. Each day since then my symptoms have lessened.\n\nAs of recently I have been taking vitamin c, zync, Zyrtec, benadryl, XR decongestant, quercetin, Flonase, ibuprofen, Zicam medicated nasal swabs, and diffusing eucalyptus EO at night by my bedside. \n\nMy acne has started flaring up again, but having a very low grade persistent virus (every time I went to urgent care I tested negative for strep and literally everything else we could think to test) for the past 9-10 weeks has been very detrimental to my overall health. \n\nIt has prevented me from exercising in order to heal chronic pain I have been living with for over 1.25 years. This has been one of the most difficult things I\'ve had to process and experience, ever. \n\nWhat I think happened: augmentation of hormones subsequent effects of drying out mucous membranes provided harbor for whatever virus found its way to me. My body had no effective way to expel said virus, so it just didn\'t. \n\nHas anyone else experienced anything like this? Legitimately thought I was dying and or losing my mind for a while there. \n\nStarting a new full time position with a virus has been really challenging. \n\nLooking forward to things getting better, but for now I\'m still not at ~100%'"

A few of you were interested in the app and how I've worked on improving my mental state and I thought I'd share my story.""",,"b'Hey everyone, I\'m Breloom. This is going to be a long one so I hope you\'ve got a sec.\n\nI\'m by no means perfect but I know the pain you all suffer from. Some of you may have it worse, and some of you may have it milder. It isn\'t a contest by any means, but I\'d like to start by saying that I love you all, you\'re a great community, and you all have a vast amount of love to give which I appreciate every day. I come to this subreddit every time that I am struggling to find joy, laughter, and community. You help me a lot so I thought I\'d try my best to give back.\n\nI got diagnosed in October of 2018 after about 6 months of therapy. After that amount of time, I developed a relationship with my therapist and she got to know me well enough to recognize patterns in the way I behave. How some days I would come in hopeless, in tears of despair. Other days I\'d question ""What am I even doing here? I feel so much better I\'m cured"" only to repeat the cycle over and over again. I originally began going to therapy because my girlfriend of 3 years dumped me, and then my immediate rebound broke my heart when I fell for her so hard. That\'s a very difficult and long story but I wanted to give you a bit of context. Before that, I poisoned myself with tons of acetaminophen when I was 19. I was jaundice, couldn\'t produce saliva, and my kidneys were failing. A few years later my father unexpectedly passed away. I\'ve gone through some shit, as I\'m sure a lot of you have as well. My disorder caused a lot of instability in my relationships and I lost a lot of my friends and obviously cost me my relationship with the woman I wanted to propose to. In retrospect that relationship was doomed from the beginning but again that\'s a different story.\n\nIn 2017 I almost dropped out college. I had most of a Mechanical Engineering degree done, but it seemed hopeless and I tried taking the easier route of changing my major to Secondary Education Math, where I found good hearted people that supported me through my father\'s death.I\'m happy to say that I\'m on my last semester of college and I\'ll be graduating with my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering soon. I disappeared before my finals and began a new job as an Energy Auditor that I did full time. I worked that job from the summer of 2017 to December 2018. In that time, I discovered the Joe Rogan Podcast and at the time I was in need of a male role model to help me rediscover what it meant to be a man. Rogan has guests all the time from scientists to comedians. I learned to laugh again through his podcast. I idolized Joe Rogan as a man that I truly respect and one day I said to myself ""Be the man you want to be"" as in ""When you look in the mirror, I want to look at a man that I can respect for everything that he is.""\n\nWhat did that mean to me? I realized that the things I respect most in a man are fitness, mental stability, emotional health, and intelligence. So I got started. I began working out. I mainly lift weights about 3 times a week. Sometimes less sometimes more, but every time I go, even if it\'s a shitty workout and I have no energy or motivation, I leave that place in a better mood because I know I\'ve done something to better myself. After getting diagnosed, I got on Lamotragine and gradually went from 50 to 200 mg daily. I try not to miss a day, but I\'m not perfect. I definitely notice the days where I miss my meds, because my mood is so uncontrollable that I snap at my closest friends and I get overwhelming urges to kick people in the mouth. I know a lot of people hate Jordan Peterson, and hell I do too the pompous bastard, but his first ""rule for life"" is ""clean your room"". He means this in that you have to take care of your own space before you try and go out and change the world. A clean room helps me so much, guys. Being able to have everything neat and tidy, my bed made, my clothes hung and folded, my desk free of cups and plates, and my bathroom counter hair free and tidy. Seriously if you do ONE thing a day to help your mental state, make your bed. I promise it will motivate you to keep everything else tidy. One thing I did was I got a cool comforter with a big ol\' squid on it. This way I would want to look at my bed and see the squid. If I can\'t see the squid, my room isn\'t clean enough and I get sad. I love squids.\n\nI began to meditate, but unfortunately I dropped the habit months ago. However, to get started I went to audible and got a membership. Audiobooks were a saving grace when working the job I was working and I discovered that there was a free 20 day guided meditation thing. I started with 5 min and eventually got to 20 min of laying in bed, closing my eyes, and breathing slow, controlled breaths. 5 counts in, 10 counts out. Let the mind wander to wherever it may go. Feel whatever it is your mind may bring up, because if it dwells on something YOU NEED TO PROCESS IT! DON\'T SHUT IT AWAY DON\'T SUPPRESS IT! Feel it, then bring your attention back to your breath. You\'ll notice that suddenly the thought is gone and you\'ve moved on. Realize that your thoughts are temporary, even if they swing back in 20 times a day as mine do/did about my ex girlfriend and every woman I\'ve ever hurt.\n\nI began to really let myself feel my emotions. I suppressed them for a long time because as I framed it as ""every time I show my emotions I just end up hurting either myself or someone else"". Recently I have found a woman who really gets me. She shares my interest, and the other night SHE kissed ME. I don\'t know about you guys, but as a man I\'m expected to make every first move. I don\'t remember the last time, even with my ex, where I was kissed first. She looked at me and wanted to kiss ME. I cried. I cried about 3 inches away from her face because I was so happy and relieved that I could be on the receiving end of love. Being able to accept that love takes a lot of work, because I don\'t feel like I deserve it after all the pain I\'ve caused but she doesn\'t care. She likes me, and damn it I like her back. After using Tinder like a drug for about a year, I finally found some emotional connection and not just some chick looking for a guy to call ""Daddy"". I\'m into BDSM, I\'ve been used for that before. A lot. People only accept the love they think they deserve. You all deserve the love that you want to give to yourself. Find the ways you can make yourself happy, without relying on others, and you can find a way to love yourself. Let yourself enjoy things, no matter who may judge you or may criticize you. Try to keep it legal though.\n\nAnyway, this is getting really long and my apologies but I\'ll try to summarize. I go to therapy once a month, down from once every two weeks. I don\'t recommend going every day or every week, because that isn\'t enough time for anything to happen. I have to give it time for events to happen, emotions to arise, and then have something to talk about in therapy. I try to eat ok, though I love taco bell, and I work out 3 times a week. This way I have a body goal, so that when I look in the mirror I can see a body I like to call my own. Flaws and all. I try to meditate. I keep my room tidy. I go to class and enjoy the lecture if I can. I take a moment to look at my surroundings, admire the height of a tree, or the sound of the birds around me. This gets me out of my head and out of those dark thoughts. Find a way to respect yourself and then take action. That\'s the best advice I can offer.\n\nI love you, r/bipolar. Here\'s my monthly Daylio Chart. All twelve months minus the current one lol. Feel free to PM me if you wanna be friends or just need someone to talk to. You\'ve been there for me, let me be there for you.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Rl9n5IG](https://imgur.com/a/Rl9n5IG)'"

Do I regret it? Sort of?'",,"b'At the end of my course of Accutane in September 2018, I posted about it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/9dcvkx/accutane\\_journey\\_steatocystoma\\_multiplex\\_holy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/9dcvkx/accutane_journey_steatocystoma_multiplex_holy/)\n\nHere are my thoughts, 2 years later. **Please note that this is not an attempt to persuade or dissuade anyone from going on the tane. I just want to share my personal experience with it so you can add it to your collection of others\' stories and come to your own decision if you\'re still deciding or having second thoughts during your course.**\n\n# PROS:\n\n\\+ Much less acne in general, and preventing acne is a lot easier. My face isn\'t anywhere near as magical and silky smooth as it was during the course, but it\'s definitely better than before the tane. Also I can actually *put stuff* on my skin/face now without worrying as much about breaking out, like sunscreen or makeup!\n\n\\+ It pretty much *solved* my dandruff problem, which I realized I had because it would all get stuck inside what used to be my thick forest of hair (more on this in the cons), and it was almost impossible to clear out.\n\n\\+ Smoother upper arms, which used to be rough/bumpy with ""chicken skin"" (keratosis pilaris).\n\n\\+ I really don\'t need to shower every day anymore (lol) since I don\'t produce nearly as much oil as I used to, and I don\'t have to constantly wipe my faceI used to blot my face with blotting sheets or napkins (either of which would come out *translucent*) every few minutes only to have the oil come back a minute later. Now I can be in humid weather and not completely break out in acne all over my *entire* body  *that\'s* how oily my skin was before the tane. In fact my skin doesn\'t feel gross in humidity, it feels like it *thrives* in humidity! Sadly I live in San Francisco, which is dry af.\n\n\\+ No serious non-cosmetic health side effects yet, e.g., Crohn\'s, depression, suicidal thoughts, etc. I don\'t notice a difference in my joints but I do think about or worry about that sometimes \n\n# CONS:\n\n**HAIR**\n\nMy beautiful, strong, thick, dense, wavy, healthy hair is not the same. During the course I though it was a *bonus* because my hair was slightly thinner and less oily which made it perfect and more manageable. However, about a month after the end of my course, my hair started falling out in clumps. Every time I\'d run my hand through my hair I\'d lose a huge clump. Honestly if I didn\'t start off with ultra thick hairso thick that I would complain about how thick it was all the timeI\'m sure I would have ended up bald. My hair used to be much thicker than average and now it\'s sparser than average to the point where I can see a lot more scalp than I\'ve ever been used to seeing. On top of that, each *individual* follicle is thinner, and I also have this weird mix of ultra thin hairs, normal-thickness hairs, and every thickness in-between, which I didn\'t even know was possible.\n\nI felt so blessed with my natural pre-tane hair that people would be in complete disbelief when I told them I never put any styling products in my hair because it always just looked like it had product in it from being so naturally strong, wavy, and thick. All I had to do was comb it in the style I wanted after a shower and it would just naturally lock in to a beautiful quiff, as long as I controlled how much/little shampoo/conditioner I used. [No](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXdl5Y8jJVQ/) [hair](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYKNr0ODQFX/) [styling](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbBJzPojRIi/) [product](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdrKShqjYiG/) [in these photos](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfcVThZBETH/), I\'m dead serious. Now my hair feels like it falls out easier, can only tolerate shampoo \\*at most\\* once a week, and needs special hair masks/leave-in conditioner and styling product otherwise it looks super dry. I can\'t even get it wet with just water without needing to put coconut oil in after.\n\nHonestly I thought I would get over this and accept my new hair after some time, which is why I haven\'t posted about it for so long, or maybe I thought it would recover and gain some of its original form back. But here I am 2 years later, still mourning this change and I\'m still not over it. I know I\'m still blessed to have a good amount of hair and I\'m lucky and grateful the tane didn\'t seem to cause anything like Crohn\'s but I\'m still filled with regret about what it did to my hair, which is/was one of my absolute favorite things about myself. For those of you who might be experiencing the tane hair loss and wondering if it\'ll stop or if it\'s permanent, *for me* it stopped shedding at an alarming rate after 1 full year of falling out fast. Now it\'s shedding at what I think/hope is a normal/natural amount. Most of what fell out in that year seems like it\'ll never come back, but at least what I have left seems to be shedding/growing at a normal amount.\n\ntl;dr on the hair: My hair used to be   a m a z i n g   and now just needs a lot more care and products.\n\n**SKIN**\n\nI scar way easier, even on my face, and my skin is just not able to heal as well compared to before the tane. A lot of blemishes stay for much, much longer, and some of them look permanent. I actually have to moisturize now whereas before I never moisturized because it wouldn\'t do it anything but feel gross and/or make me break out.\n\nMy skin is a lot drier, forms creases more easily, and just doesn\'t feel nearly as elastic/supple as it used to beI seriously feel like my skin has aged like 8 years instead of the 2 that actually passed. I also joined the eczema club, which I never had before. I get it in anywhere, e.g., fingers, thighs, and the inner corner of my right eye :( but thankfully it\'s not *too* common and tends to be mild.\n\nMy lips used to have superpowers or something because they legit would *never* get chapped, not even when I went snowboarding or to the desert lol but now they\'re normal lips that can get dry sometimes. Not a huge change issue tbh. I\'ve never ever had to use chapsticks and I still don\'t really need them. The silver lining here is that my tane course taught me the magical ways of 100% lanolin nipple cream as the holy grail chapstick.\n\n**EYES**\n\nMy night vision is *terrible* now. It\'s noticeably and considerably worse, particularly if I\'m trying to make out edges/shapes of things when it\'s darkmy mind will try to fill in what\'s there but is usually wrong which is can be really quite jarring. Also lights have a noticeable halo around them but that\'s not a huge problem, just slightly annoying.\n\n**STEATOCYSTOMA MULTIPLEX**\n\nI have steatocystomas, which are just little, painless, hard bumps/sac that stay just under my skin, permanentlylargest one I\'ve ever had was the size of a penny in my cheek. It\'s a relatively rare skin condition and largely inherited as far as I\'m aware, so if you don\'t have them, don\'t worry about this. If you do, keep reading.\n\nWithin these 3 years during/after my course I\'ve had at least 4 incidents of new steatocystomas, 2 of which ruptured out of my skinwhich had never happened beforeand 3 of which ended in permanent scarring, whereas they used to never rupture out nor scar. What\'s interesting/strange is that they slowly grow and get red, itchy, painful, and super hot. My body runs really cold so it was quite a stark contrast.\n\nAn incident I wanted to highlight involved 2 red, painful lumps growing on my sternum. Peak size was about the size of an eyeball. My derm suggested corticosteroid injections, which caused it to explode when she did it (gross, and painful wtf). It did help immediately calm the swelling, but after it healed it left a scar/indentation which is still there, 2 years later, about the size of a pencil eraser. A new one appeared about a year after that one, this time on my upper/inner left thigh. I decided to let this one run its course naturally and it\'s been healing for several months. I\'m pretty sure it\'ll just leave a permanent dark area but hey at least there\'s not an indentation scar like last time! No change in my existing steatocystomas prior to the tane course, and there doesn\'t seem to be a change in frequency of new steatocystomas compared to before.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nAll in all, I felt like this is what I traded for going on the tane:\n\n* Thick/hard-to-manage but strong, beautiful hair that I loved  thin/weak hair that needs a lot of gentle care and products\n* Super oily face  dry/normal face and super dry rest of the body, skin is way less supple, felt like it aged a ton, gets wrinkles easier, scars easily, doesn\'t heal as well, and it can actually thrive in humid weather now and not break out if I put any products on it\n* Rough, bumpy upper arms  smoother upper arms\n* Normal, benign steatocystomas  aberrant, scarring steatocystomas that often hurt/itch when they appear\n\nIf I could go back in time and tell myself if I should go on the tane, what would I say? Honestly, I would probably tell myself: **no**. Granted, there are a lot of pros listed above, and a lot of the cons listed are not a huge deal, but given that new steatocystoma growth naturally declines with age and so does skin oiliness, combined with the fact that new cystic acne frequency declined steadily as I agedat that point I had no more cystic face acne, only cystic bacne every once in a blue moon, plus I\'d learned to deal with them pretty well already, and I only had bad face acne before collegeI think I was too hasty in my decision to go on the tane. If I\'m being honest, my super oily face was too big of a factor in making that decision, and it shouldn\'t have been. I had cystic acne, yes, but honestly in hindsight it wasn\'t severe enough to warrant everything else, so in the end it personally wasn\'t worth it for me. Someone else viewing my situation/story might think it *was* worth it and that\'s a fair opinion too, but personally I regret it.\n\nI do know, however, that out of the 5 or so friends I know who have done the tane, they had an overall very positive experience, with few or no adverse permanent side effects. Only a *single one* of them regretted it like me. So, again, I\'m not trying to dissuade anyone, but just know that there\'s a riskjust as with everything else in life. It\'s a small one which is why I do generally still encourage people to try it even if I regret it.\n\nAll I ask is that you be very careful with your dosage because even though higher doses (shorter time) decrease chance of remission, it\'s remission of the good *and* bad; plus they can increase the risk of adverse side effects. Not all derms know thisthey don\'t even know about nipple cream as lip balm (come on!! Accutane 101!)and mine certainly didn\'t and put me on a dose that I personally think was inappropriately high toward the end of my course.\n\nFinally, I wanted to talk about something I see a lot in this subreddit: please don\'t negate or diminish our stories. We\'re not being shady or making this up or trying to dissuade people. I just want to add my story, even if it\'s not as positive as most stories here. Thank you for reading this wall of text.'"

Advil rash,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/xy970p/allergies_rant_so_tired_holy_crap/,b'Allergies rant - So tired holy crap',,"b""I have not slept much since autumn started. Autumn is my favourite season, and I've been able to enjoy it with no allergies at all in the past but something is different now and everything I've tried has been completely useless. I have full blown hay fever nearly everyday - it always gets worse at night or even if I'm just going to take a nap. It's like my body is allergic to sleep. I read that the body produces more histamine when you're sleepy, so I guess it is in a weird way sort of true.\n\nThis week has been brutal. I've been so exhausted to the point that I've lost entire days to being too tired to do anything but nap and sneeze. But there is no relief. Every time I go to bed I wake up in the night or early morning sneezing and extremely allergic. Everyday I have been taking two reactine extra strength allergy pills and two extra strength Advil, because ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory med so I figure it must do something for allergies. I also recently started getting serious about taking my Avamys nasal spray everyday. This combo seems to work but the allergies never completely go away, they only die down to being the normal mild allergies I used to have back when I didn't have any allergies. Absolutely everything itches including my skin and my scalp. I had a weird hivey rash on my neck this summer and mild allergy symptoms a few weeks before the severe hay fever kicked in. I feel like that rash was an omen of things to come. But it could have been unrelated.\n\nI have no solution to this right now. I might try to go to the doctor but it seems futile. I've suffered with this for years, some years much worse than others. My allergies were practically non-existent for most of the 2010s, and I want those years back. God damn. I feel like maybe it was also better because I was more diligent about using my nasal spray. I became careless and my doctor did not inform me I needed to take it regularly for it to be effective. I know now thanks to the internet that it does in fact need to be taken everyday for it to be helpful and same for allergy pills. You cannot skip a day with these things. So I will just do that and pray it works."""
NSAID eyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/11rxrui/odd_symptoms_looking_for_things_to_rule_out_with/,"b'Odd symptoms, looking for things to rule out with doctors'",,"b'Hi all,\n\nIve had odd symptoms for several years now. Have been to 3 rheums, 2 immunologists, a few PCPs, a couple physiatrists, a pain management doctor and a neurologist. Many admit some symptoms are odd and have no real ideas. I sort of gave up, until a few days ago. Unprompted my neurologist told me she always felt like there was something underlying all my weird conditions. I suppose this was furthered by her injecting some Botox into my back and it bruising in what she called a very strange way that shes never had happen. (Except Im not hypermobile, so dont think if its EDS its the h type). I am a 32F, no history of sports beyond middle school, which I think is important. Anyways the symptoms include (and admittedly many may be unrelated, since I dont know just listing them all!):\n\n-chronic b12 insufficiency and malabsorption with oral supplementation/food; I have been injecting monthly for 5 years now. Pernicious anemia and sjogrens ruled out by blood tests. Also other vitamins have been found to be deficient even when Im consuming 200% DV daily through oral supplements alone, not even counting food (at various times vitamin D, and folic acid).\n-chronic migraines which at times result in 8-16 hours of vomiting if not caught quickly.\n-cervical bulging discs with spinal \n-lack of feeling/reduced feeling in extremities which often presents as me partially ripping my nail out of the nail bed (has happened half a dozen times in the past 4 years, once observed by my mother, a PCP, who confirmed the nail was vertical and bleeding everywhere). I have never fully ripped it out though and with pressure and bandages have always been able to reattach it with my mothers guidance. \n-tendonitis in both arms for 11 years now, unresponsive to NSAIDs. Musculoskeletal ultrasound found nothing beyond the tendonitis (no tears etc). \n-labral tears in both hips, one of which a sports medicine surgeon said looked consistent with playing hockey (which I dont). The one hip is painful, which Ive never done a musculoskeletal ultrasound on (only x ray and other imaging). Not sure if the pain is just related to stress on other muscles, or something not caught by imaging. \n-high cholesterol even though Im thin (BMI 19 or so; 140 lbs 59), eat well, and walk a fair amount. \n-adenomyosis\n-recurrent UTIs beginning in early childhood \n-suspected neurogenic bladder (unable to ever fully feel my bladder is empty) \n-lose immunity to vaccines including MMR, hep B, and HPV. Have had various bouts of HPV and required cryotherapy twice to resolve abnormal cells and cervical changes causing pain and bleeding. My mother had endometrial cancer (which she believed related to her being overweight). \n-chronic seasonal allergies/ nothing specific \n-I always get told theres blood in my urine and that I have a yeast infection when I get urine collected (not matter where I am in my cycle) and even though I have had a yeast infection and do not feel symptomatic when physicians have observed this. \n-I have an eye freckle (only one, thankfully); rosacea; often have tonsillitis\n-fatigue and insomnia are my most annoying symptoms. I have done numerous sleep studies and therapy for sleep with no success. \n-once years ago I bleed brownnot period, actual brown colored urinea few days after having bad pain in my lower back. Ultrasound ruled out kidney stones, which my father suffers from. \n\nI know this is a long list and much of it is probably unrelated, so any ideas of potential leads would be amazing. Thank you!'"

So far, I've had a history of CRSwNP that resulted in a surgery (alongside a septoplasty which fixed it but not fully as well as an adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, and I believe turbinate reduction) and I am basically allergic to everything. My doctors couldn't believe how my total IgE was over the 700s with somehow getting a positive reaction to every blood test they did, almost everything on the skin pricks, and especially to most foods (which make it almost impossible to even do an elimination diet). Currently I'm on a daily regimen of Nasonex, Claritin, Advair, and Singulair, although I switch up the Claritin often. I had Flonase but my doctor switched me to mometasone given insurance wants to see failures before moving me into XHance or Dupixent. Even so, on a regular basis, I don't often notice it, until I get this sharp pain in my inner ear where it swells up and I lose my hearing.\n\nMy pulmonologist is currently looking into whether or not I have AERD. He feels given the IgE, I could have eosinophilic, allergic, and exercise induced asthma.  Originally I didn't think I was allergic to Aspirin, but after realizing I did have an adverse reaction to Moltrin when I was young that no longer happens with NSAIDs, it may be a possibility. My PFTs are often normal, but my Methacholine Challenge came back positive (I believe they tested me at 1mL on the first run). My ENT has put me on allergy shots but was hoping that my Skyrizi usage for my psoriasis would help me out as well, but there has been discussion about starting Dupixent as well for my current situation. My pulmonologist doesn't like the idea as much, but overall as long as I don't trigger my asthma, I'm basically breathing fine and I'm healthy there \n\nWith the most recent CT, we see the polyps again in the same area, we still see the build up, but it brought up mastoids again (1st time in 2019 when I lived around NYC) with potential damage from it. At this point, I'm trying to figure out what is going on. My CBC and CMP have come up normal multiple times. We really don't know what's going on other than my body overreacting to basically everything.\n\nI just figured I'd post this to see if anyone has been in my position. This is just a combination of really strange things that I can't seem to figure out."""

Shannon Beador\'s post-opt [**photo progress**](https://www.bravotv.com/the-real-housewives-of-orange-county/lookbook/shannon-beador-pre-reunion-co2-laser-facial-details)**.**\n\n**For reference:** I am a 29 year old female, who for the majority of my life has treated my skin, for lack of a better term, like shit. I have always struggled with acne and have been striving for that perfect, ""poreless"" skin *(yes, I realize now that this is unrealistic for truly anyone).* Irregular periods, being very athletic, oily skin, bigger pores, and parents who had terrible acne growing up created the perfect disaster. I did a round of Accutane in high school, which helped subside and eliminate the extreme cystic breakouts from there on out. I still struggle with minor breakouts as an adult, but really the majority of my issues has been from me abusing my skin by not protecting it and over treating/over-exfoliating. **I never wore sunscreen** \\- *I know, this makes me cringe saying it, too.* And you best believe in the summers you would find me out by the pool and in the winters in the tanning beds. I overcompensated on exfoliating, trying to get rid of my oily skin but not realizing it was oily because it actually needed moisture. I definitely overused Reitnol for a good 6 months to the point where it gave me the \'orange peel\' like texture on my cheeks.\n\n**So where did all this bullying of my skin get me?** As mentioned, large breakouts stopped for the most part. But what I was really starting to struggle with was now the combination of oily/dry skin, large orange peel textured pores, fine lines on my forehead, acne scars fairly heavy *(mostly boxcar and a few ice pick)* on my cheeks, and just a total hit to my self confidence. Thankfully, make up does wonders. But sometimes my skin would look worse in a different way from make up *(looking super dry, sinking into my pores/fine lines to accentuate all of the texture)*. Over the last two years specifically, I couldn\'t help but notice how shitty my skin looked in comparison to others. I also couldn\'t help but keep going back to the fact that ***I\'m not even 30 and my skin looks so bad.*** I made a commitment to start investing in the time, resources, and knowledge to start healing my skin.\n\nI started my aesthetic process by doing about 4-5 rounds of **PRP microneedling** in 2019. See the [vampire facial](https://www.allure.com/story/vampire-facial). I did see a difference, but I believe the amount of damage I had done to my skin over time was no match for that and wasn\'t going deep enough. After lurking Reddit and Instagram for other peoples experiences, I saw a lot of mention of lasers. **Which scared the absolute shit out of me and my wallet.** Ultimately, my dermatologist recommended we pull out the big guns and go for 2 rounds of **CO2 laser resurfacing** *(spaced 2 months apart)* and finish out with some filler on a deeper scar indention on one of my cheeks.\n\nI wanted to share my experience here day by day to help others who may be considering or have questions about the CO2 laser process. When I was doing the research, I found it hard to find others on Reddit who had went through it themselves.\n\n**Pre Procedure:** there wasn\'t a lot that needed to be done here. You\'re supposed to stop pretty much all actives, limit time in the sun, drink plenty of water to be hydrated, and take medication if you have history of cold sores. I get them in my nose, so I started a prescription of **valacyclovir** the day before, the day of, and the day after to prevent a breakout caused by stress of the procedure.\n\n**DAY ONE:** first CO2 laser treatment. For 30-45 minutes I sat with numbing cream on my face. After that, they came in to inject more numbing into my face. This was honestly the worst part. I probably had 20+ needle injections all over my face. It felt similar to getting botox, but slightly worse. I don\'t do well with needles, which is why I personally felt like this was harder than the actual procedure itself. After numbing for a bit longer, they did some **subscision** to the deeper scars on my cheek. This was to help loosen up things under the scars. Then we moved onto the laser. I would say it took anywhere from 30-45 minutes. She went through two times with two different laser frequencies. There were parts of my face that didn\'t feel anything and other parts of my face *(chin, under eyes, upper lip, temples)* that had me gripping the chair and letting out a few exasperated HMMMMM\'s. Pain only occurred for the brief moment the laser zapped you, but getting zapped over and over for 30-45 minutes can be a bit grueling. You could smell a slight burning smell and I was given a mini fan to hold and point directly on my face to keep it cool through the procedure. It was definitely a gnarly experience, but not unbearable. I also want to note that I have a pretty high pain tolerance. They had some \'laughing gas\' on standby in case I needed it to distract me, but I never ended up taking it. After laying some cool gauze on my face post procedure for awhile, they loaded vaseline on my swollen chipmunk face and sent me on my way. I really didn\'t feel any pain the rest of the day/evening. There was definitely swelling, redness, and small amounts of blood seeping out until the evening. I was able to gently cleanse with CeraVe and reload with some vaseline before bed. I slept propped up by pillows on my couch to help with the swelling.\n\n**DAY TWO:** I woke up with more blood on my face that had seeped out over night, but was able to cleanse it off and reapply Vaseline that morning. I took my **antifungal** and started an **antibiotic** that I will take 3 times a day for a week. At the 24 hour mark, I was able to start my vinegar soaks. Basically, you fill up a big bowl of cold water with distilled white vinegar and you soak fresh gauze pads in there. Every 2 hours, I take out some gauze pads and lay them on my face with ice packs over them for a few minutes. Then reapply the vaseline. I honestly have had zero pain. Not even a slight discomfort of that \'sun burn feeling.\' If anything, it\'s just obnoxious having a greased up face all day. I can tell my face is in the weeping process as it tries to recover from literally being burned off. No peeling yet and the swelling is pretty much gone, which is surprising. I have heard people swell for much longer. It\'s hard to see the fine lines, pores, scars in this state - so too early to give feedback on how it looks.\n\n**DAY THREE:** After a full day yesterday of vinegar soaks every two hours, I was glad to finally have some time to sleep and not have to constantly be attending to my face. I woke up this morning to no more blood seeping, very minor swelling, a lot more clear seeping throughout the day *(it doesn\'t really drip down your face, the vaseline catches and holds it),* a sun burn like redness, and a little bit of tenderness I wouldn\'t consider painful. While cleansing and doing my first vinegar soak of the morning, I could definitely tell the skin is getting a tougher/sand paper like texture to prepare for the peeling portion. As the day went on, I started to see what looks like a reddish \'mask\' on my face, which I anticipate to be the sign that peeling is about to start. I have randomly had spots here and there that are getting itchy, but nothing too bad right now. I have Benadryl on deck for if /when it gets worse. All in all, I don\'t look that spooky yet. Just lots of weeping made greasier with the layer of vaseline I reapply after my every 2 hour vinegar soak. Showers have been fine, I just avoid putting my face directly under the water. I have a follow up appointment with my doctor tomorrow morning.\n\n**DAY FOUR:** Last night was probably the most \'uncomfortable\' I have been throughout the whole healing process, and I use the word uncomfortable loosely. I kept feeling little tingles/itches across my face that kept waking me up. Frustrating because all I wanted to do is touch/itch to make them go away. I ended up grabbing a mini fan and put it next to me in bed and pointed it towards my face and that helped for whatever reason. Still sleeping slightly elevated, but not as much as the first night since the swelling is gone. My follow up appointment went well! She was very happy and said everything looked great/was healing nicely. I had a few tiny white heads pop up on my cheek and chin over the last 24 hours that she quickly extracted out. It was likely caused by the constant vaseline on my face. They prescribed me a topical antibiotic to help combat those, but told me to let them know if anymore pop up because I may need to come in again to get them extracted. I now only need to do vinegar soaks two times a day *(morning and night)* and only apply vaseline if the area starts getting dried out. I still have yet to have any peeling start, but it should happen within the next few days. For now my face just looks nice and greasy all day. I have another follow up appointment on Thursday *(three days from now).* All in all, it\'s been a pretty seamless healing process!\n\n**DAY FIVE:** Sleep went much better last night and I finally allowed myself to lay flat. I\'ve been sleeping with a clean towel over my pillow to not get my pillow cases dirty and to protect my face. I\'ve been a lot more lax where if I am feeling a slight tingle/itch, I\'m very carefully just poking it with my finger nail to make it go away. Not sure if I\'m supposed to do that or not *(probably not)*, but I keep my hands fairly clean throughout the day and it\'s so unsatisfying not being able to do anything about it haha. I\'m starting to peel on my chin, but that\'s about the only area so far. My skin is definitely feeling more rough before I put on a fresh coat of vaseline. A couple more white heads popped up, which I quickly extracted. Hoping the ointment I started last night puts an end to those from reoccurring. Still no pain. The mild tenderness is even going away. Also, I wanted to do a quick note on working out/being active. For the last 3 days I have been doing very light 20-30 minute yoga classes. I am pretty consistent in working out, so the thought of doing nothing for the next 7-14 days was driving me a little crazy. I\'ve made sure to do things that won\'t break much of a sweat. I am a runner and sweat like crazy when I do, so I am not going to push it with that until I get the go ahead from my doctor.\n\n**DAY 6:** Not much to update, honestly! Still have vaseline on my face all day, which is sticky and yucky.. but my skin looks nice and dewey. I haven\'t really been peeling as much as I anticipated and I am not sure if it\'s a good/bad/neutral thing. I\'ve had slight, thin peeling in a few areas like my chin and forehead, but nothing substantial to make me look weird or scary. Not pain or sensitivity. Ready to see what\'s under this layer of skin that needs to peel! I have another appointment tomorrow morning, so I should have more of an update then.\n\n*I will update daily, if people are interested!

baclofen,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/nuixjk/officially_diagnosed/,b'Officially diagnosed!',,"b'Hello! \nI am a 26yo female who was diagnosed with combined ADHD for the first time about a week and a half ago now.\n\nI originally sought help in March after a huge mental breakdown. I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me zoloft for my severe depression and anxiety. After about 2 months on Zoloft she directed me to find someone to evaluate me for ADHD, as well as the therapist I was seeing recommended I get evaluated as well. \nAfter finding an appointment, I had my evaluation on 5/25 and was officially diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Combined ADHD. \n\nMy provider started me on Adderall 10mg and I am following up in two weeks, as well as keeping me on Zoloft with the expectation to up it, and then Baclofen as needed for anxiety.\n\nI started Adderall this past Friday and I have to say it is a world of difference so far. My mind feels so quiet, I am able to focus and concentrate more than I ever have. Coupled with the Zoloft Ive been so motivated. I started running again and I never have to fight myself to get out the door, or spend hours procrastinating on going on my run. I attribute this more to the Zoloft than the Adderall, though. \n\nWork and school are still a work in progress, but I figure that will take time. But so far Im liking what I see while Im on Adderall. No adverse side effects, just feeling like a normal person. Weird. \n\nGrateful that I found this sub to help push me to get diagnosed! Excited to see how much better things get.'"

SSRIs make me nauseated and sick. Abilify/seroquel I remember made me feel horrible, instantly sick, tired, shaky, more. Emsam I think caused some insomnia and mood swings and didn't help. \n\nKlonopin helped me for a while with anxiety but then after a while I started to question if it was doing anything or if it was making depression worse. Baclofen had a great anti-anxiety effect on at the start also but then I seemed to become immune to it after while. Gabapentin I also tried, it's used for pain in addition to anxiety so it had kind of a numbing effect, I don't think it was helpful and I think it probably had some negative side effects but not certain about it.\n"""

The first headache ended with an immense migraine (probably the worst Ive ever experienced) where I was roiling in pain, vomiting at every twinge of movement, every flash of light, and every sound. After taking 2 extra-strength Advil pills and sleeping for 3 hours, the headache was gone. However, for the next 24 hours I felt DRUNK. I was so dazed and confused and just generally exhausted, for no apparent reason other than that I was just recovering from the constant pain.\n\nI was headache free (for the most part) for the next 6 days, with the occasional stab of pain in my temple that lasted only a few seconds.\n\nI was concerned by how long this headache had lasted so I was tracking my habits to see if there was a specific trigger. Caffeine seemed not to influence the pain, nor did my sleep schedule, diet, water intake, or stress level. As a frequent migraine-sufferer, this temple headache had been significantly more manageable than I was used to, however the persistence and the constant location of the pain were what alarmed me.\n\nAfter 6 days of a new headache in the exact same spot, I decided to visit the walk-in clinic near my house. The doctor essentially brushed me off and said that my headaches are probably just stress or tension headaches, despite many of my symptoms not matching the description of a tension headache. He told me that I was probably looking at my phone/laptop too much and not stretching enough, and recommended I try to reduce my screen time. I have followed his instructions so far, limiting my screen time to 30-60 mins a day, and I make a point to stretch my neck and shoulders every 15 minutes. So far, this hasnt helped a thing. In fact, my headache was worse today than it had been previously.\n\nIf anybody has any insights as to what may be wrong with my head, I would appreciate them.'"

M. Feedback Appreciated.\n\nHello, I am currently on 500mg of Divalproex DR (250mg tablet twice a day).\n\n\nRight before this, I was prescribed 10mg of Haldol (5mg morning/5mg night) when nightmarish hallucinations manifested due to sleep deprivation and my panic was noticed by my partner and mother. However, this treatment did not last long because I experienced really severe Tardive Dyskinesia (TD), so the doctor at the ER suggested that I stop the Haldo and gave me Lorazepam and Benadryl via IV to help alleviate the side effects. I then proceeded to take the 50mg of Benadryl that the ER prescribed for the following days until I saw my psych again.\nBefore the TD set in, Haldol's cons were that it made my mind feel really foggy after I woke up.\nI initially had numerous lows when starting Haldol (took 5mg the previous night/5mg that morning) where I'd tear up suddenly. It settled down throughout the day, and because the TD was really distressing, I didn't think the mood dips were as crucial. I don't know if that's related to the Haldol, but I still feel it's worth a mention.\n\nThe week following the Haldol ordeal, I started on the Divalproex DR. \nI have noticed some improvements after two weeks and got another two weeks refilled. While I did experience some random gloom here and there, it's short lasting. Overall, I did notice a significant improvement how I felt and those around me pointed out improvement of my attitude/behavior.\n\nHowever, as of lately, I have noticed a return in night time paranoia (which I'm anxious will cause night terrors again), and unfortunately experienced an excited state a few days a go and felt a rush of aggression seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nCurrently continuing Divalproex as instructed; I see my doctor next week and will mention this, but I was wondering if anyone has been through a similar situation and if the random paranoia/quick agitation/aggression was able to be treated. Hesitant to use antipsychotics again, but not completely against the notion. Any perspective is appreciated, thank you"""

Also said that my oiliness and breakouts are starting to get bad again since the warmer weather has kicked in. So, I was told I can stop using WL, but continue with tret.

(TL:DR at bottom)',,"b'I know most talk about drugs is frowned upon but considering the topic at hand, I hope this is one of the few exceptions.\n\nWas finally diagnosed(was always told I was just lazy and finally took myself in) at 26 with ADD & High Anxiety. Since then I have been reading up on it for almost a year now and have been trying to find clarification on just one subject. The studies I have read always bring up the fact that there is a link between drug ""Abuse"" and ADD/ADHD.\n\nThe reason for the throwaway account is because I wanted to share my experience(which I do not recommend to anyone else) of how I ended up self medicating for years on Opioids(The Acetaminophen & Hydrocodone helped alleviate my anxiety and helped me focus). I only graduated H.S because of this and when I went on to college and stopped self medicating, I would fail. I did find a temporary solution which was music. It drowned out all the noise and l was able to focus on one thing. It didn\'t work for long and I ended up dropping out of college twice. Went for a third time and started self medicating again and my grades were greatly improved, however I did not like that I was depending on the pills that were meant to treat pain. I went to my family doctor and straight out told him that I was taking opioids to help me with school. His response shocked me ""Don\'t worry you are not an addict, you are just trying to help yourself."" \n\n*Most of what I could remember him telling me*\nMost people who go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed will end up self medicating and not abusing it like others. That the reason for the self medication is to seek a solution to the problem that they have in their normal life. Where others see drug abuse at first glance, in reality it is someone scared to seek help in fear of the consequences that may follow. We should not see this as a problem but as a symptom and act accordingly. In your situation I\'m not surprised you picked opioids as a solution since it works decently with your issues, but we need to get you on the right medication in order to fully treat you.\n*\n\nHe then recommended me his friend and I\'m now being fully treated on the right medication.\n\nHas anyone had experience with this type of thing before ? People using drugs in order to help themselves and not just abuse them ?\n\nTL:DR - Read everywhere drug abuse was an issue caused because of ADD/ADHD but was told by my doctor it\'s self medication and should be a symptom as such.

This post contains mentions of mensuration, suicidal thoughts, overdose mentions and and s/h mentions \n\nA few years back I started experiencing delayed periods, ex: getting it in March then not getting it again till May. When this started happening I got bad cramps and nauseous feelings when standing and it got to the point where I couldnt stand without feeling like wanting to puke. One time my parents wanted me to clean despite my terrible pain and I told them and they didnt listen to me. When I kept complaining about the pain and not being able to stand for long periods of time without throwing up my mom got mad at me. She told me to just Take a pill and if you take a pill it will go away. Now I get very anxious when taking pills (I think I may have a anxiety disorder but not the point) and I refused. My mom suddenly gotten angry and yelled at me that the world didnt revolve around me and that the world wouldnt stop just because I got my period. Obviously I got overwhelmed and started crying which seemed to just piss my mom off even more. Now I have a hand stim that I use to calm myself down that I do get made fun of at home for doing and I started to aggressively stim trying to calm myself. They crushed up the pill and told me to take it. I took it and went to bed crying my eyes out feeling like I was worth nothing. I have very bad self worth issues and I believe that was the start of the decline of my mental health. I still remember it and it makes me terrified to think of it. (This is where the more mental health starts to take place)\n\nNow this is the major tw for attempted overdose, s/h thoughts, and suicidal thoughts if you are sensitive about the subject please stop reading.\nRecently due to quarantine my mental health has been on a decline. My parents have been fighting more and my dad seems to sometimes not like me for my inability to hear him (I have some sort of ear problem that makes it hard to hear out of one ear and its hard for me to hear which I have informed them of). Because of these fights my suicidal thoughts started to get worse then the usual one time thing I got. One day in the middle of online class my parents had left home and I did something that I regret now, I went to the bathroom and frantically look for Advil or something to overdose on and couldnt find any pills and returned to class like nothing happened. I havent told anyone about this, and more things have happened since then like me running knifes down my arms not cutting but borderline being s/h. I know my parents fighting and my moms hard words are the reasons my mental health has declined but they are so nice to me. Im an only child and would say Im fairly spoiled by some standards (I own a switch laptop for school and a iPhone 8). I know my parents love me (or at least I hope) I am their miracle baby and know they care about me. I know my mom and dad love me but they are also the reason my mental health is shit and I dont know how to feel about them. Reddit please tell me should I be upset at my parents for destroying my mental health when they didnt mean to? Or am I just being sensitive and should get over the past.'"

I have a persistent painful but not itchy papular rash from jaw to mid-upper body and angioedema in my extremities. Ive also got persistent pain (both achy and sharp) in my bladder and urethra that is not going away despite clear urine culture. Acidity makes this worse, but dilute urine and numbing dye dont help. I read up and discovered that there are high concentrations of mast cells in the lining of the bladder and urethra, so Im assuming that this is an allergic reaction. It makes sense as UTI antibiotics are meant to be excreted in the urine. \n\nAnyone else who has experienced this, how long did it take for the reaction to go away? Any medications that helped? Im takin Claritin, Pepcid and quercitin. Taking 3 extra Claritin and a Benadryl doesnt seem to help.\n\nIm in pain and the rash is hideous.

But it just seems to be getting worse. Every time I eat food gets stuck between the last molar and second to last molar on the upper right and left sides. Its been my right side for a long time so I would avoid it and use my left side to chew, but now both sides are getting food stuck and causing a ton of pain. Its really difficult to floss the food out with out causing more pain and slight bleeding. Years ago when I last saw my dentist I was told I needed a mouth guard b/c it appeared I grind my teeth at night. I have Crohns disease and am on immunosuppressive shots Stelara and was on steroids for awhile but am now off. I also take Citalopram. About 6 months ago when I was flossing part of one of the molars on the upper right just popped off my tooth, so after that there was an even bigger space for food to get stuck in. Ill admit I should floss and brush more, but my current routine is brush with an electric toothbrush every morning and floss mostly just the molars when I have pain.\n\nMy question is, does this sound like gum disease or just weird gaps? Will being more adamant with personal dental care (brush twice a day, floss twice a day, add mouthwash) fix this or do I need to spend the money to see a dentist?\n\nThanks for reading guys!'"

They just don\'t work on me anymore.\n\nNow, I have a gap + a huge cavity in my upper rights (don\'t know tooth numbers), after every mean, I can floss out pieces of food the size of peas or corn kernels. There is gum recession and at my last dentist visit, some evidence of bone loss. This was a few years ago. They tried to do xrays, but could not, so they settled on a pano, but I guess it didn\'t give them enough detailed info to do a procedure, but even if it had, I require sedation.\n\nSo I switched clinics, to a local sedation dentistry outfit that came highly recommended/rated. That\'s when I learned that my insurance would not cover the sedation part, and it was like $1,600. So I had to postpone ""establishing"" myself with them until my next medical Flex spending annual cycle. \n\nThat didn\'t happen - life got in the way - wife and kids, injuries, illnesses, job changes, multiple deaths in the family. The tooth got worse, occasionally there would be pain for a few days or a week, I would aggressively treat it - brushing 4x a day, rinsing 2-3x a day, using listerine, using chlorhexidine, putting a bead of Anbesol on some dental floss and flossing with it to make the pain go away -- eventually, the pain would go away for a few months. This continued on and off for 4 years. My breath is unimaginably bad - brushing does little to ameliorate it.\n\nNote: Here\'s something I noticed. Once during this period, a coupla years back, I had a bacterial illness of some kind, something in my lungs. They prescribed me Cipro (I think). by day 2-3 of the Cipro, it was like my gums had magically been cured - no stink, no bad odor, and essentially no symptoms. Don\'t know if that\'s relevant info or not.\n\nAnyway... This past week, the pain has been borderline excruciating -eating hurts, drinking hurts, soda REALLY hurts. I\'m about to sign a contract for a new job that will raise my salary $15-20K, so I figured the $1,600 sedation bill will finally be do-able, so I went to get checked out and the Sedation Dentistry place i had tried to see years before.\n\nI spent 45-50 minutes in the chair trying to get xrays done. Couldn\'t do it. The ""Rinn"" system thing and the bite apparatus/wand was WAY too big for my mouth, I couldn\'t seem to control the movement of my tongue, I kept gagging, violently. Nothing worked - breathing through my nose, saline sprays, nasal cones, using a pediatric sized attachment, nothing. (I can\'t do the numbing spray - I have swallowing issues as well, and the numbing makes that really bad.) The hygienist was SO patient with me... literally over a period of almost an hour, trying over and over again to get it to work. I had to leave with no xrays, and no diagnosis.\n\nThey did take a pano. But they said I needed a full set of xrays. \n\nI\'ve been calling around locally to see if ANYONE still uses old school bitewings and film, but no dice. I don\'t know what to do. i can\'t pay an extra $1,600 just to be sedated JUST for the xrays. And my need is becoming emergent. Bone loss has almost certainly worsened, the pain is affecting my daily life, at a minimum I need a root canal, but more likely an extraction, a screw and an implant. But the clinic won\'t do anything without detailed xrays of the region.\n\nMaybe, given the situation, Delta would consider the sedation ""medically necessary"" and approve coverage for it? I\'m lost - stressed out, and in a lot of pain. Don\'t know what to do - practically in tears right now.'"

They were often accompanied by stomach acid. Episodes ended when I went to sleep for the night.\n\nStopped all carbonated beverages 15+ years ago. \nStopped all alcohol 3 years ago.\n\nStarting 1 year ago, I had an episode of severe hiccups/diaphragm spasms with acid coming up. But it never stopped. It's been happening almost every day since. It often happens in the second half of the day. It has never involved vomiting or actual food coming up.\nThe only thing that reliably calms the spasms is laying flat on my back. This is notably the opposite of how acid reflux works.\nMost, but not all, mornings are ok. Once it starts for the day, it continues until bedtime.\n\nThe spasms can be set off by acidic or spicy foods, bending down, or strenuous movement, but usually are not. On most occasions, there is no discernable trigger. I avoid acidic and spicy things. I do not use any drugs or alcohol. I have fasted completely from all food and water, and still had spasms occur. I attempt to exercise to stay healthy, including 10 minute cardio and muscle-group HIIT routines. These do not trigger spasms, but if I'm already having spasms, I can't do them.\n\nThe spasms temporarily calm during sex. If I'm having them, but manage to be intimate with my wife, the spasms stop during the activity, and return after. This makes me think there is a neurological issue, possibly enteric. But I'm not a doctor. \n\nI had an esophageal manometry that showed 0% motility of the esophagus, including the sphincter that separates esophagus from stomach. I was put on strong antacids. They sort of helped. I was on pantoprazole for several months but symptoms worsened. I accidentally missed a dose and felt better. The gastroenterologist concluded I may be allergic to pantoprazole and switched me to something else. I've been through a bunch of medicines, currently on Nexium. None of them have solved the spasms, but sometimes they ease them, sometimes not.\n\nThe gastroenterologist has no idea what I'm talking about when I describe the spasms. Neither does my regular doctor. They understand acid issues related to the dysmotility, but not the spasms.\n\nI went to a rheumatologist, and auto-immune diseases were ruled out. Systemic sclerosis was ruled out.\n\nFor 2 years, I have been struggling with erectile dysfunction. At first, it seemed due to Risperdal, which I was taking for bipolar. (I have been mentally stable for 2 years.) I had unusually high prolactin and low testosterone. The medicine was stopped, hormone levels normalized, function returned. But the over the last year the dysfunction has intermittently returned. Over the last 4 months, severely. I've been to two urologists. I've been on 20mg daily cialis for a while. I have tried viagra too. Nothing has consistently worked.\n\nIt is NOT psychological. I've been in therapy for 3 years, have worked extensively on this. I've had instances where I had no psychological confidence, was sure it wouldn't work, and performed incredibly well. I've had instances where I had all the confidence in the world, and failed completely. It is not an attraction issue - my wife is stunning. I sometimes cannot even masturbate, so the problem is pervasive. Overall it seems the problem is worsening.\n\nTwo months ago I was given baclofen and dicyclomine, nerve/muscle relaxants. They assist the spasm problem but don't solve it. I recently tried going off almost all meds, to see if erections came back. They did not.\n\nOver the last 6 months, I've had dizziness, often on standing, but sometimes generally. I also have tightness in the chest and shortness of breath, usually when spasms are happening, but not always.\nEKG and cardiac ultrasound came back clean.\n\nI have slightly low iron and vitamin D.\n\nMy current meds are:\nWelbutrin\nBuspar\nBaclofen\nDicyclomine\nNexium\nCarafate\nIron\nVitamin D\n\nI also take supplements that are supposed to help erectile dysfunction, like L-arganine, horny goat weed, maca root, ginseng, tribulus, etc.\n\nHistory:\n7 years ago I had shingles. It was a two-zone case, in two adjacent areas of the lower spine. I don't know if this has any bearing on current problems.\n\n9 months ago I had covid. Most of these problems existed before the virus. Dizziness, chest tightness, and shortness of breath have happened several months after recovering from covid. My covid symptoms were fever, low temperature, soreness, aches, and severe headaches that continued for about two months. I was not hospitalized. I was vaccinated (pfizer) 5 months ago. I have strong antibodies, according to blood tests.\n\nI am scheduled to see a neurologist soon.\n\nAll the doctors I've seen are mystified and don't know what to make of this constellation of symptoms. The strain on my marriage is intense, and the spasms make playing with my kids often difficult. I want my life back. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated. Thank you so much."""

Ive been dealing with psychotropic med-induced constipation for a while and it can be very painful and frustrating as some of you can relate. Im writing to see if any of you are willing to share management regimens that work for you, successful treatment experiences that you have had, or any relevant stories youd like to share. \n\n\nCurrently Im taking Senna Plus Tablets (docusate sodium 50 mg & sennosides 8.6 mg) once a day and fiber gummies (2-4 g soluble & dietary fiber daily). I might increase the Senna to twice daily per doctors orders because Im still not having complete bowel movements and only going twice a week. I also have Miralax but dont usually reach for it because have never really found it to make a difference. I have magnesium oxide 500 mg caplets that I used to take that were somewhat helpful that I might add back into my pill organizer. \n\n\nWhen I was on clozapine things were so bad I was going maybe once or twice a week. I happened to be admitted for an episode where I mentioned these issues and they took an abdominal x-ray and were horrified at the state of my colon. They wouldnt admit me to the unit until they could make me have a bowel movement as I was basically on my way to almost being impacted. They gave me magnesium citrate (which might be the most disgusting thing ever), senna, and a suppository and threatened to manually disimpact me if that didnt do the job. Yikes. Thankfully sometimes later some of the worst cramps in my life finally got things moving. After an exhausting hour in the bathroom - they were pleased and admitted me to the floor. \n\n\nThey kept me on twice daily senna and I was able to go normally for close to a month. Then things fell into their old patterns again and Im so frustrated. I did stop taking the senna at some point and dont want to have to rely on it. I know its bad to use a stimulant laxative continuously. Ive reintroduced it again recently because the situation has grown pretty dire again.  Sigh. Im really tired of pooping like a hesitant rabbit. \n\n\nI had a doc give me samples of Linzess at some point but I lost them and never actually got to try it out. Ive always been sort of prone to constipation so Im wondering if it might be worth bringing it up to my pdoc. How I wish I still had those samples!!!\n\n\nI had recently had some lithium added to my cocktail and that always seemed to loosen my bowels which seemed to normalize things for me whereas maybe it would cause diarrhea for someone else. Sadly it hasnt been the case but it may be because we opted for a low dose add-on since my cocktail is so busy. Dunno if it would be worth shifting things around and increasing the lithium to see what happens. Ideas ideas. \n\n\n**TLDR**; Anyways - talk to me about your struggles with psychotropic drug induced constipation and what has worked for you. Nobody likes to talk about pooping (or not pooping) but I know Im not alone in this struggle! \n\n\nPosting my med cocktail below in case anyone has any insight on any offenders to my problem:\n\n* Latuda - 60 mg qPM \n* Lithium ER - 450 qPM \n* Zonegran (zonisamide) - 200 mg BID\n* Zoloft - 50 mg qAM\n* Adderall XR - 30 mg qAM \n* Ativan - 2 mg QHS PRN \n* Ativan - 1 mg PRN\n* Hydroxyzine - 10-20 mg PRN\n* Levothyroxine - 100 mcg qAM \n* Liothyronine - 25 mcg qAM \n* Spironolactone - 100 mg BID\n* Metformin - 500 mg qPM\n* Senna Plus - 50/8.6 mg 1-2 QD\n* Fiber Gummies - 2-4 g sol fiber QD\n* Loratadine - 10 mg PRN\n* Acetaminophen - 500 mg PRN\n* Aspirin/APAP/Caffeine - 250/250/65 mg PRN\n'"

I'm an American internist who has been an attending for 2 years, I work as a hospitalist. I chose this field because I enjoyed the breadth and acuity, and towards the end of residency, I was really tired of the rat race and academia at large.\n\nI am now starting to think I may have made a mistake. I went into medicine to use my knowledge and intellect to improve people's lives, but it seems that nobody values me as anything but a dispenser of Lortab and a source of imaging and consultations.\n\n\\---\n\nIn general I have started to realize that there are many factors pushing against the position of generalists (IM, EM, FM, Peds) in medicine:\n\n* Increased pressure for low-value consultations (mainly from patients, but also for legal risk management)\n* Increased pressure for low-value imaging (eg: the patient who claims she has excruciating abdominal pain and browbeat the haggard nocturnist into giving 1q4 Dilaudid, but has a wholly benign and unchanged abdominal exam and you know there's nothing that will show up on CT-Abd)\n* The codification and algorithmization of medicine\n* Increased patient volumes, which further shunt you into reliance on algorithms as a matter of necessity.\n* Cost-cutting measures from admin, which often involve making our jobs worse or getting rid of us\n* The overall denigration of generalist professions (from specialists, admins, midlevels, patients/families, stray cats, etc)\n\n\\---\n\nAgainst all this, we mainly have the status quo on our side. I don't think it will be enough.\n\nThe hospitalist profession is only about as old as I am. EM is a few decades older than that. FP in its current form...I think originated in the 1960s. There's no cosmic law that says we have to be around forever. So I guess my question is, do you think we'll be going the way of the dodo?"""

This is a very simplified version of a complex situation I\'ve been experiencing. I was using Afrin and Flonase (corticosteroid) nose spray for months. Within that time, I started getting really bizarre and severe symptoms including: \n\nNumbness in parts of my body, pins and needles, ear pressure, internal tremors (it felt like my body was bobbing or swaying on a boat when I was laying), adrenalin surges all night causing insomnia, fainting, vertigo, odd heavy sedated feeling in my limbs, chest tightness, shortness of breath, derealization, heart palpitations, brain fog, suicidal ideation, severe panic attacks different then ones I\'ve ever experienced. They were so primitive, I would wake up and feel like I was in actual danger and felt like I needed to get out of my house. I ended up going to the ER on 3 separate occasions and went to 6 doctors/specialist in this time. I was convinced I had an autoimmune disease or MS that wasn\'t being diagnosed. The insomnia got so bad I went into psychosis and had derealization so bad I truly felt like I lost my mind. I\'ve dealt with anxiety for years and have a pretty good grip on how to calm my nervous system but this felt out of my hands. No matter how calm I got my mind, my body was not adjusting and was in a constant state of fight or flight. I knew something was off in my body. \n\nI made the connection when I used Flonase one night and my lips went numb. I looked online and found thousands of people sharing the same symptoms. You can find some here: [https://www.askapatient.com/viewrating.asp?drug=20121&name=FLONASE](https://www.askapatient.com/viewrating.asp?drug=20121&name=FLONASE)\n\nI also found these two articles on another Reddit post sharing two stories of side effects from oxymetazoline (Afrin) - \n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/22/health/a-wedding-a-cold-and-a-trip-to-the-emergency-room.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/22/health/a-wedding-a-cold-and-a-trip-to-the-emergency-room.html) \n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1486156/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1486156/) \n\nI stopped using both and went through a crazy withdrawal period for about a week. I was having tremors and night sweats, severe vertigo, sharp random pains, throwing up, brain zaps, vibrations all over my body, painful pressure in my hands and feet. I was getting 2 hours of sleep per night and would be in agonizing pain physically and mentally. It seemed like some of the same side effects people experience with discontinuation of benzos or SSRIs. I could barley do anything for months at this point from being so tired. \n\nThe doctors had little answers and kept saying it was neurological but they didn\'t know what it was. During this ordeal, I had the following test done: Holter monitor, MRI, EKG, EEG, Covid antibody, Lyme, autoimmune disease, hormone levels. I\'ve been prescribed 2 antidepressants, migraine medication, and Ambien (I didn\'t use any of them). One doctor told me I was hallucinating it all because I was sleep deprived. I thankfully found one doctor who confirmed that these symptoms could be due to the nose sprays but didn\'t have much of a solution. \n\nHaving to be my own advocate throughout this process, I\'ve dived pretty deep into what could be causing some of my symptoms. Since corticosteroid is a synthetic cortisol, I believe my hormones have been affected.  I\'ve read that excess cortisol can give you symptoms like pins and needles, numbness, muscle weakness. During this time, I also came off birth control. I was off it for a few months before starting the nose sprays but I was starting to experience weird, mild sensations before starting both Afrin and Flonase. After talking to a holistic doctor, I realized that my hormones were never tested properly (needs to be certain days of your cycle for an accurate blood test). She also said it sounded like Lyme which can often come back false negative. Even though my hormone test came back normal, I believe getting off birth control and adding in a steroid threw my hormones off. I also know that both sprays messed my sinus up so bad which I think have been causing ear and head pressure, vibration in my head, and brain fog. I also understand the impact of my nervous system being in a sympathetic state for so long and what that can do to my mind and body. \n\nI stopped 3 months ago and I now have good and bad days. I will go a week or two feeling 80% better but then it will hit again. I talked to a functional medicine practitioner who mentioned withdrawal can happen in ""windows and waves"". Your windows are your good days and your waves are the bad. In time, the waves will become shorter. I exercise regularly, practice yoga and meditation, and eat healthy. It\'s been terrifying to experience what a simple medication can do.\n\nI guess what I\'m curious about is if my body will adjust over time or did something like hormones or nerves get affected by all of this and I need to be looking into something else?  I\'m interested to get to the root cause of what might have happened rather than just take more medications.'"

anticonvulsant problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/u7d3s1/meds_make_me_brain_dead/,b'Meds make me brain dead',,"b'Hello Everyone!\n\nI have a huge problem complying with the treatment.\n\nA few words about me. I am 27 year old guy recently diagnosed with BP-2. In addition I have anxiety and substance abuse issues (mainly opiates and alcohol). On the other hand I am a design engineer working R&D and take a huge pride in what I do.\n\nNow - I have already switched doctors asking for another opinion - and the new doctor (just as the previous one) strongly recommends taking anticonvulsants as a base drug.\n\nI have tried two of them with the same result - I have become totally brain dead within several hours from the first dose and remained in this state for a week, even though I did not redose later on. I was not able to work - it was impossible for me to focus to design a very simple part. I had to fall back to a drafter role for couple of days (and even that was hard for me).\n\nMy doctor encourages me to start the treatment with even smaller initial doses and large intervals between any increment. She says that the bad symptoms will go away with time (that I do not have).\n\nYes - these drugs do eliminate my anxiety. My thoughts stop racing and I do not feel the urge to get high. The thing is though - I do not trust that I could be mentally as sharp as I am even after this initial phase. And sure enough - when I am depressed I sometimes cannot wake up to go to work - but once I am at the place I can force myself to do something. Anything. Sometimes I am still high from the evening before. Sometimes hungover. I even designed something when I was still drunk. Yeah, boose and opiates impair me hugely but usually it is just one day or even several hours of potential loss. Not weeks. And still I can force myself to imagine something. Not the case when I take valproate. If I take valproate the imagination is completely gone. All tasks that are short term memory intensive are virtually paralyzed.\n\nSo having said that I have a question. Is it actually the case that the brain finally finds its way of thinking after a prolonged anticonvulsant use? If so - how much time off would I need?\n\nAfter all I am still open to improve some things. I tolerate olanzapine and quetiapine quite well (but they are not quite effective ;)).\n\nI definitely need to stay creative. It is almost the only thing I value about myself. I am afraid I could lose it the longer I self medicate.\n\nAnyways. Thanks for reading my story. I will appreciate every input.\n\nNever forget who you are. Cheers!'"

This has been going on for about 3 weeks, and side effects gradually reduce in severity as the day goes on.\n\nIt got so bad that my psychiatrist prescribed me Dicyclomine 10mg which is used to treat IBS. I've been taking that for about a week now, and so far its slightly helped with the side effects, but not enough to make a difference.\n\nAside from informing my psychiatrist, what else can I do in the mean time to lessen these side effects? I make sure to take it with food and lots of water. And why am I getting them now but not when I first started the vyvanse? Will they go away eventually? """

Story time! So I had a dull leg pain during my pregnancy last summer and after i had my baby in october It didnt go away so in february i went to a guy who cracks bones (not a chiropractor just a huesero. The night after this man cracked my back i felt an intense burn in my lower back kind of like a contraction when youre in labor and i could not move. I had to call out of work and i just cried because i couldnt walk. I went to the er for what felt like the 20 th time this year and they final did a CAT scan that showed a bulging disc. Later that month (still not able to walk and just unbearable pain in my right leg) i got an MRI that showed a 9mm disc herniation. I eventually went to PT where the dr. Told me that the herniation was too severe to reabsorb with just therapy and that i would need surgery. I didnt want to go with the orthopedist that my insurance sent me to so I did my research and found Dr. Khounganian (who im so thankful for! Check him out if youre in Los Angeles/San Fernando Valley). Im finally able to stand straight and exist without pain. I only have pain in the incision site but thats to be expected. Its terryfing that youre not allowed to bend, twist or lift for a month since i accidentally flipped to my side in my sleep last night but i feel fine. You will need a lot of help post op! My bf took the week off and i have my parents helping me too. I need help getting in and out of bed and going to the bathroom. My surgery was outpatient so i was out of the surgery center 2 hours after it was over. I'm taking hydrocodone every 4 hours and flexeril every 12. I dont think i need the hydrocodone anymore but Im not going to risk unbearable post op pain so ill continue it every 6 hrs tomorrow. \nThanks for reading my rambling!\n\nDay 4 update: \nDay 2 was my most painful day just the incision area no sciatica yet. The only time the incision gets hurt is when i get back into bed because obviously my weight is squishing it but other than that Ive been goodZ my throat was still a little sore from the breathing tube but easily forgettable. \nDay 3 was better no more incision pain or drastic swelling around the wound (Ive been drinking a lot of arnica tea with fresh aloe vera because they do wonders for inflammation) Im still taking hydrocodone acetaminophen 5-325 every 5 ish hours and flexeril every 12. Ive been walking about 4 times a day 10 min each as my nurse practitioner instructed me to. \nRight now its 8 am day 4 and I didnt feel stiff this morning like i usually do but I am having sciatica symptoms on my buttcheek. You know that knot feeling you get in your buttcheek and it feels super tight? Its that but thank goodness no leg pain. Im going to try to walk a little more today because i do notice that my spine/back feels very weak at the beginning of my walks like it cant be straight it wobbles. Im also going to try to stop taking the hydrocodone today since i went about 7 hours without it and didnt feel pain (im just paranoid that im going to feel crippling pain like before surgery but im sure ill be fine its just the trauma of having sciatica pain for 10 months) \nIll be back! \nThanks for reading"""

I've probably gotten 6 hours of sleep in total over the past 8 nights.\n\nI've visited and talked to two different doctors who say it is likely due to the Bactrim antibiotic course I was on since I don't have a history of insomnia and nothing in my life has drastically changed.

I'm not sure if those were due to exhaustion from lack of sleep or if it was from the medication, but I decided not to take the Trazodone again since it didn't even put me to sleep to begin with. The joint aches have continued ever since, and are debilitating to the point where it's extremely painful just to lie in bed. \n\nAfter my 6th night of insomnia, I decided that I wanted to see a doctor in person, so I scheduled to see a doctor near my house.

Missed 2 days of work due to intense pain at night and not being able to sleep. Called my dentist and asked for something for the pain, he gave me 8 hydrocodone to tide me over.\n\nFriday morning I started to see some swelling on my neck that was noticable to other people. By Saturday morning the swelling had grown a lot. I had been on the penicillin four days and it seemed to obviously not be working. Went into an emergency dentist, he prescribed Z-Pak and 800mg Ibuprofen. Gave me a referral to a different endodontist to see if I can get in sooner. Said to go to the ER if the swelling started to affect my breathing, but they seemed to think the swelling was pretty normal, which relieved me a bit. \n\nHowever, my swelling is continuing to increase, and now the left side of the bottom of my mouth is starting to swell up, swallowing is becoming more difficult, and I've been drooling the last time I slept. Pain is intolerable until I take a hydrocodone with the ibuprofen. I only have one left because most providers don't like to prescribe that stuff now. I was trying to ration it as much as possible for night only but the pain is very intense.\n\nI only took the first dose of 2 Z-Pak a little over 12 hours ago.

I don't want to be that guy that googles stuff and self diagnoses, but I am worried about Ludwigs Angina due to all of the swelling being the underside of my neck and now the fact that underneath my tongue is starting to swell. I know it is rare, but I am pretty freaked out due to how bad the swelling is (never had anything like this happen before, and this is far from my first tooth infection.)\n\nMy wife is a nurse and wants to take me to the ER today, but the emergency dentist said not to do that until swelling makes breathing harder. I am scared to wait to that point but I also don't want to go just for them to tell me to go home and wait for the Z-Pak to work.
